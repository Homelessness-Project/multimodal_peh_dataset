MR. DONAHUE : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community , especially Auxiliary Bishop John Dougherty who passed away over the weekend . Please keep the Dougherty family in your prayers tonight . Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS.

MINUTES OF THE HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD MEETING HELD NOVEMBER 18, 2021. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? MS. SCHUSTER : I have comments on the two, but I'm going to save it for Fifth Order. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Anyone else have comment s on any Third Order items? Just in terms of the Single Tax Office's funds distributed , I did speak with Cathy Wechsler this afternoon . And moving forward , there will be a year-to-date comparison . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 She already sent us the one that will be in Third Order for next week with the year-to-date comparison . So that will be done moving forward , they have been sending them weekly because the money's been coming in. But I think after next week's one, it will be on a biweekly basis instead of weekly. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So the Arc of Northeastern Pennsylvania asked me to read this if there is anybody out there looking for a rewarding way to earn some additional cash by soaking up the sun. They're looking for summer camp counsellors . And it would be from July 6th through August 9th. Requirements are a high school diploma or GED, 18 years of age and a valid driver's license . So if anyone is interested -- I know some seniors for the past couple years got involved in this. It was very rewarding . So if that's the case and you're interested , please apply. You could stop by the administrative offices at the address listed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 below which is 115 Meadow Avenue or online. You could find that on their Facebook page. On your application , please specify job title camp counsellor . And applications should be submitted by April 15th and mandatory orientation week is June 27th and times to be determined . And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one. MR. KING: I have a few. Oh, go ahead. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. On Saturday , April 30th, there will be the Pine Brook Family Arts Festival . And that will take place from 12 to 4. That will be located at 927 Capouse Avenue. And it's the first time they are running this festival . It's part of UNC of NEPA, Lackawanna County Arts and Culture Department . And it's part of the Pine Brook Revitalization Plan. And they'll have a lot of family fun activities there, including music, axe throwing for kids, which I'm assuming it's not real axes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 So that will be good. And there will be food and lots of fun for sure. So that is two weekend s from now if anyone is interested in attending that. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have announcement s? MR. KING: Yes, just a reminder with DPW, garbage collection is off by one day. So typically if you have your garbage picked up on Friday, it's going to happen Saturday of this week. So everything is moved one day this week. Also, I had mentioned I think last week or previous ly that I guess this Friday, this weekend is Earth Day. There will be a cleanup at Nay Aug Park. I'm sure there's going to be cleanups throughout the neighborhoods around the City. But I was asked to announce from 9 until 3 p.m. at Nay Aug Park. I think that's going to be spearheaded by Bob Gattens from the Scranton Municipal Rec Authority and many other volunteers . That's this coming Saturday . And also to get back to Mr. Coyne had asked a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 question about the two officers who recently had DUI arrests , we sent a request down to Scranton Police Department to see whether they were suspensions with or without pay. We have not received a response as of yet. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have announcements at this time? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Today is April 19th, day 109 of (inaudible ) 2022. Thirty percent of the year is gone. So what is the status of negotiations on the various union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding that negotiations are still ongoing. MS. HODOWANITZ : I cannot imagine that the unions will accept a 2 or 2 and a half or 3 percent pay raise when you have 8.5 percent inflation which is not going to abate any time soon. And I'm wondering how long these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 contract negotiations are going to drag on, especially if they go to arbitration , which leads me into my next comment and that is the March Controller 's report. I was a little taken aback when I saw under human resources that Ufberg and Associates were paid $97,397.19. And I'm assuming that is for their role in these union negotiations . Apparently for -- that's under professional services . And the budget for the entire year is $500,000. And I checked back in November of -- or back in 2021. The budget for professional services is only $339,000. So they upped it by $107,000. Well, they've already eaten $97,000 for contract negotiations . And if anybody makes money off of this, obviously it's going to be the lawyers once again. And it's almost like 2 million dollars or so that it cost the county when they had the prison investigations and had the team of lawyers reading e-mails. They're going to go home fat, dumb, and happy. I think my next incarnation I'll come back as a lawyer. It seems very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 profitable . Although on the positive side, 5-C that Gregg and Joan Sunday are making their second $5,000 contribution to the Fire Department . I think that's a singular act of generosity from a family to which we owe a lot of gratitude . Item 3-A in the backup, the HR memo on position updates, I notice that a lot of the positions were posted only internally. Why is it that we don't post everything both internally and externally ? Don't the resident s and taxpayers of the City have the right to apply for positions within the City? Why is it posted only internally ? MR. DONAHUE : So I believe that's the first step in terms of the CBAs where someone can bump into that position . And then, you know, then you have to wait for those dominos to fall to see where the actual open position is to then go out externally . I believe that is the case. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, I no longer have property taxes since I sold my property , although I pay indirectly because I pay rent. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 But if I were paying a property tax, I would be pretty irritated that I should have the same right if I wanted to work for the City to apply for a position . I don't see the logic of that. And I don't see the ethics of it. I think that that is a position that's seen its day. It smacks nepotism . There's an awful lot of families that are employed by various governments . MR. DONAHUE : I think that's just following the language of the CBAs. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, the CBAs should be changed . That's not the only thing that should be changed . Their contracts should not end on December 31st. We should not be in this position of having expired contract s during negotiations because it's costing the taxpayer money if you just look at what you're paying the lawyers . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner , taxpayer . I talk about this many times, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 utilities are ruining our City streets . I drive all over the City. On Main Avenue -- North Main Avenue by where Dunkin' Donuts is, there's a pave cut there for months and months and months. It's still there. It's filled in, but it's not level. If you don't slow down, you'll ruin your car. There's another one on the 2100 block of Pittston Avenue coming down the hill, I drive that almost every day. It's a huge pave cut. Again, it's a -- you have to slow down to like 10 miles an hour or you're going to ruin your vehicle . That's been like that for at least seven months now that's been the same way. Do we have a pave inspector -- pave cut inspector ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, the City has one. MR. SPINDLER : Well, I don't think he or she is doing their job because these things go on for months and months and months. You know, your car's going to get ruined if you don't slow down and if you don't know they're there, you know, it could cost you a lot of money. And plus, on Pittston Avenue, not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 only pave cuts, Pittston Avenue is a mess. I don't know if anybody drives there. I drive on there. There's potholes , rough road. That whole thing should be milled and paved. I know that's PennDOT . That's not the City. It's a mess. Next thing, last fall I came here and talked about the DPW inspector -- supervisor that came and painted lines all on my corner and said they're going to take care of the curbs. He said we'll be here before the weather gets cold. Well, they didn't come. And now the weather is turning nicer so I hope they're going to come around and do what they said they're going to do. Next thing, last week in the paper I think I saw the list of streets to be paved. And I saw Court Street. It's not too far from where I live. I drive on that every day. I hope that includes the underpass not far from the Village of Tripp Park. That underpass is a mess. It's been patched and patched and it comes up and it's -- like I said, you have to almost stop to go through there. It's a mess. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 So I hope that -- I hope it's going to go all the way up to where that is. And lastly, the supposed Pocket Park on Linden Street -- Linden and Wyoming , I don't see any progress there at all. Is there an update on that? MR. DONAHUE : So they're testing the fill for the second time to make sure it's clean fill. And it should be done within the next 30 days at least filled and then, you know, the other work will begin. I will get an update for you on that. MR. SPINDLER : It's just sitting there with these huge slabs of concrete sitting there. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, there's certain testing requirements that the fill has to go through . At least that is my understanding of it. But I will get an update for you on that on a more exact timeline . MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Well, that's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Bob Bolus, Scranton . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 First off on 5-D, it relates to Griffin Pond. I think it's great somebody is donating some money to them. Council , I think you individually or as a group should visit Griffin Pond and get a better understanding of exactly what they do there instead of hearing rumors and stuff like that. It takes a lot to understand , the understanding of the job they do for the animals . I personally through Fresh Pet have donated thousands of dollars of Fresh Pet dog and cat food to them. My company transports it for free. We never charge a penny to take it. I give them storage trailers when they need it, whatever they need up there. But anyone who criticize s them should be ashamed of themselves because what they do for this community , you can't put it in words. And I think they should be applauded rather than criticized by some people that have criticized them. It's time to really pay attention what they do for these animals . And, you know, people lead by example . The leader leads by example , not by talking about it. We have the Biden signs that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Council and the Mayor took our voice away and agreed to put them out there, changed Spruce Street to Biden Street, the expressway and signs on 81. Well, if anybody is paying attention to what's going on in this country right now watching this blither ing idiot as he is -- and I say that as an American citizen of what Biden is doing and humiliation he is creating on us and the people of the City of Scranton , I'm asking you to be leaders tonight to vote a referendum to remove those signs, go back to Spruce Street. And if you are real leaders and true leaders, put it on a referendum for us so we the people -- and that's an important thing you need to understand . It's not about you guys. It's about us. The humiliation we get, thousands of people see him on 81, we're being made fools of publically and nationally every time he opens his mouth is to put a referendum on tonight to remove those signs if you got what it takes to do what's right for us, the people. And that's why I came here tonight 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 because I have been all over the country , and I hear it all over, trucker convoys we were involved in. It's a humiliation . It's an embarrass ment. And you guys are part of it why we're getting it. So do what's right for us. And, Kyle, I brought up last week the last time I was here I asked if you become a representative now that you're sitting at Council as the President , you were part of the Biden fiasco. Are you going to hear the voice of the people if elected or are you going to do just what you did here against us and the people and not pay attention to what we have to say? This is important for us who we put in place, especially in a higher position than Scranton City Council . Are you as a leader -- I looked at billboards , a true leader. If you're a leader -- and don't take this the wrong way, but if you're a leader tonight put it on a motion to remove those signs and respect the will of the people here as a Councilman as you would if you were a representative . Respect us and we'll respect you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 But that's what I'm here to ask for tonight . You know, a funny thing went on. And I'm going to demonstrate it while you people all honor who Joe Biden is. Oh, there was nobody there. This is what our embarrassment is, humiliation . I rather see you put a sign up The Office on Spruce Street than the Biden name. At least that Office had credibility and had respect all over the world where I've travelled people bring up The Office. So if you're going to do anything , do what's right. Do what's right for us. That's all I'm asking you to do tonight if you really want to be a true leader, now is the time to lead. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Bolus. Next on the list, Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . Thank you, Mr. King, for getting back to me on that even though it was a non answer. At least it is an answer that you're still waiting for a response . Last week before this body I asked about fast tracking money for the charity food 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 banks during COVID supplied food to nearly -- to the community and to continue with that they continue with food bank and distributing to the people who are now suffering from the increased cost of food sources . It was mentioned that they were reviewing all of the surveys for the Recovery Act Fund. And once that was done, they would have a view on how it would be distributed . And until then, no decisions on that fund have been made. But last week an article in the newspaper seems to be (inaudible ) contradictive to that stance. About three or four weeks ago City Council passed a funding grant for 10 electric cars and its charging stations . It was pointed out that the $90,000 for the car would pay for about 10 percent of the cost. And a Council member wondered where the other money was coming from. Well, it appears that like with all funding for the good of the people, the funding for the electric cars was already allocated and scooped off the top of the Recovery Act Fund. Nothing says fiscal responsibility like we take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 our cut off the top before you get a chance to choose to serve the public. We serve the government first because the people are not the priority . Next, we have a new truck for the Fire Department , one that comes forth to obligate the City to a seven year $715,000 contract all signed by our current Business Administrator for a bid that bid out during the pandemic when he was not even the administrator . As the order was put in for it August of 2020 for this truck, and Larry West started on July 16 of 2021. Who ordered this as it is devoid of any initial paperwork , no record on bids, sign offs or even negotiating on expenditures . It says it will be paid from from the capital fund and it's already allocated from the community development business grants. What block grants was it already allocated from and who allocated the funds since it is not even been approved for purchase before this body? And why did it take from August of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 2020, 17 months to get before this body from the time it was ordered and the period that it states under that contract before this body is under three weeks. The contract starts per that contract on May 1st or 12 days from now. How can Council sign a contract that is required to be out here for three weeks when it is not even handed to you after 17 months giving you a period of under three weeks to process it. This is wrong. Obviously you did not approve from it. Maybe it was the grant was asked for and the purchasing agreement was done by the Fire Department beforehand because they didn't know they needed City Council 's approval and did not know that City Council needed to be informed at what future expenditures they decided to cut out of budgets . This is not the first time, the second time, nor the third time that things are hitting this Council 's board with less than three weeks before they are suppose d to be paid. Whoever is doing this is really jamming up Council horribly to say that we now have to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 do it because our reduced interest rate will run out within a few weeks if we don't jump right now. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I'll bring up the CDBG funds and the fire truck in Fifth Order. Next on the list, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council . I don't know whether you people know it, Tuesday 's old people's day at Gerrity 's. I should know better than go on a Tuesday . They're not my best fan club when I go. But today I wrote this down real fast so I would remember it. Today this woman that was in Gerrity 's I ran into her at the Good Will store. And then I ran into her at the Dollar store. And finally she had some words to say about poor Ronnie. She said I wasn't a nice man. I'm a nazi clan head white supremacist who should be banished from Council speaking forever . So I knew you would like that. She said I'm a lowdown Republican who should be deported. I don't know where you could deport me unless it was back south. That's her stand. She said I was so deplorable that the (inaudible ) wouldn't touch me that I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 uncivilized . I think I have surpassed anybody 's conduct as far as she's concerned . Now, quickly , for a year or so I've been whining about how bad my neighborhood has been going downhill . The two houses on the 2600 block directly across from me, one sold for over $100,000 last year and one sold this year for over 100,000. Two houses over was a house owned by a fellow in Long Island that he milked it dry. It sold for 40,000 a couple weeks ago, 40-something . Directly across of that was a small house that sold two or three weeks ago in the 40s. And the people that moved in there is what everybody in this -- his property would grin. This isn't -- I sit here and you people keep talking about blight and stopping it and getting grants to tear down houses. You wouldn't have to tear down houses if you didn't allow people like Bond and this guy from Long Island to milk this property dry and not pay taxes to start with. And then the worst of the worst come. Yesterday -- last night when I -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 the day before last night, I mean, when I took my dog out after 11:00 news, I heard noise. This jerk is sitting in his car on the front grass playing the radio so loud I could hear it half a block up. That's my new neighbor . That's what destroys the property values in this whole area around me. I got two junkyards behind me. Nobody said a thing. You just don't care. The one house where the school bus has been parked for a couple years, the lady that lived there about 10 years ago told me they condemned it. That's why she moved. And there's somebody living there. I don't know the circumstances . You know, what good is it -- like taking care of your property when you have someone creating poverty three or four houses up the street? They got two barking dogs that bark when a leaf turns over with a little homemade wire and cardboard fence. Right next to them is where the people, the school bus stops for your children , not my children . Your children are walking around there. Cars are going 60, 80 miles an hour right through there where Wells and Main 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 is. You got good laws on the books and you just don't enforce them. That's because we have a pitiful licensing bureau like I said last week. Every last one of them ought to be fired and put some people to work that want the jobs. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Mr. Ellman, would you be able to provide us address es for the properties that are -- so that we can send somebody out? MR. ELLMAN: I'm not saying you're not doing your job. It's more than one department and more than Council not doing their job. MR. DONAHUE : I understand . But we can't pass on information if we don't know exactly where to send Code Enforcement to. So if could you give us just the address es of the properties in your neighborhood that are an issue and we'll pass them along? And hopefully someone will go out and take a look at them. All right? MR. ELLMAN: You know, it's a shame. I'm 86 years old. I won't be around much 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 longer. My two boys don't want my house. And like I said real quick, the insurance raised my rates. Now the house, I pay more insurance than it's worth because the neighborhood dropped . MR. DONAHUE : All right. I understand . MR. ELLMAN: It's not my fault the neighborhood doesn't look good no more. I cut my grass the other day when I told you I got my lawnmower started . You know, I try to take care of it. MR. DONAHUE : I understand , Mr. Ellman. We'll talk after and I'll get some addresses . Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for tonight . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , taxpayer in the City of Scranton . I guess maybe it's that we're two days off from a holiday when there's lots of extra food that you wouldn't normally have on a Sunday. And, you know, like that piece of pie that's sitting out there and you can't eat it. And then later in the evening you go out and say, I'll just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 take one bite. And you go back in. And the next commercial and you go back and have another one and soon it's gone. And I think that pie might be that rescue plan. There should be by now there were several things that were done both on line and in person. And I think that by now we should have had a master plan here for you to look at. MR. DONAHUE : We're getting that next week. MS. SCHUMACHER : You are. MR. DONAHUE : Yes, and Anser is coming back in to discuss that next week for -- in caucus. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, because I am really worried . One of the places it was -- I think it was my favorite front page of the Times-Tribune was the February 10th where on the one side if you recall I brought it in. It had the sprucing up the former Spruce Street project and then on the right side it had the City is going after the reducing the monies that the people in the 1700 block of Wyoming Avenue had won from the jury. So it just speaks volumes . Now, on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 Wyoming Avenue, Mr. Schuster , you asked Frank last week to do something to look into that. Is that back for tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : I did get an e-mail. I think it came out today if that's right, Frank, about the neighbor that we're waiting on signed the agreement . So that should be moving forward . Or I'd to like to see it moving forward . But that's what they are were waiting on there for the 1700 of Wyoming . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Excellent . Okay. Back to that project , have you ever -- I don't recall that that project has ever come to this body; am I incorrect ? MR. DONAHUE : The final fix? MS. SCHUMACHER : No, no, back to the former Spruce Street. MR. DONAHUE : No, that's going to be included in the final -- in the project s that we approve under ARPA. But we -- I could assure you that no ARPA money will be spent on Biden Street. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good. MR. DONAHUE : That will not be in the final plan.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MS. SCHUMACHER : Very good, because I just see these little nibbles coming and nothing left at the end of the time. So I'm really happy about that. Now, last week I spoke on the paving program somewhat too. Did any of you go out and actually look at the roads that are being done because in addition to, you know, the information that I shared last week, there are streets there that have been done in the last couple of years. MR. DONAHUE : On which list, the list that was in Third Order last week? MS. SCHUMACHER : I believe so, yes. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MS. SCHUMACHER : And, like, again, we've talked in the past about changing the codes and doing things. I would put something like that in the code that the DPW -- we got this open government now that is suppose d to give us so much information . But do we have each block last time it was paved? I don't think so. And so I think that should be -- we should have that information . And I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 there are a lot of roads that I have travelled over that are a lot worse than some of those roads that are on that list. So I think it would behoove you to go out and look at some of those. And also to look at the roads that come into the City, I mean, I just think -- you know, you come down Moosic Street and it's, you know, you're going to -- beautiful city, beautiful architect ure once you get across the bridge. But before that -- I have run out of time. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . I'm sure you could hear me. Once again, we got the speech. And it's worse every time. Here's a good one. Silent majority against GOP's moral panic. And it's all about critical race theory in high school. Majority of the parents believe that their kids are getting a good education and it's like 72 percent . And they say that their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 local teachers are good. In Florida , they banned half of the math books because it pushes critical race theory. I mean, banning books, really? How far does this have to go with these nuts even the one that we have to listen to every other week. I mean, I'm all for Griffin Pond and I got my doggy from Griffin Pond, but, you know, it's just ungodly. The reason I don't come here talking about a real lot of stuff from local because I think things are going fair. You can't always get what you want. But, you know, you don't have to make a federal case out of everything . Last week on voting rights I mentioned American Legislative Exchange Council . They're instrumental in not lobbying against raising minimum wage of hamburger helpers. You know, the list goes on. Now last night I came up with the American Accountability council -- or what was it, federation or something . And it was funded by dark money. And they're the ones running around with all of this QAnon stuff and in addition to, accusing people of being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 pedophiles like our judge that was just nominated and passed for the Supreme Court. And it's just entirely ridiculous . Like, all you have to do is bring that word up and the person is hung. They are also -- these organizations are against voting rights and stuff. So it could get better and better. And you running for public office at times, that can also affect you. It could come home to haunt you. Everybody is looking for some reason to condemn a candidate before they walk in the door. If you think that Joe Biden is a fool, well, two or three weeks ago Donald Trump called up the Kremlin -- some official from the Kremlin and asked for help with the next election . We don't need their help. You know, and by the way, call this number and compliment and ask for a little more expediency for Ukraine , 1-202-225-3121 and ask for your representative . And you're free to talk about something else too if you have any ideas that have been kind of making you a little itchy or something like that. But it just goes on and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 on and on. And by the way, Daren{phonetic ) Industries , the lady that did talk about Daren Industries last week on Dixon Avenue, I'm familiar with those people. I was down that area. And Daren Industries collected the KOZ discount for taxes for 10 years, promptly moved out and they're now up on Salem Road out of Archbald along the new Robert Casey Highway . So and they are getting another KOZ. So that's 20 years of tax free after they destroyed a neighborhood . Thank you and have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Not at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : So, yes, I do. I have a few. So one I spoke about this a couple weeks ago in caucus, and I asked about it again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 tonight . Mr. Voldenberg is going to reach out to -- Mr. Voldenberg , if you will, if we could reach out to the administration about the Civil Service Commission . I notice that there's been a minimal amount of members at the last couple of meetings . I have a concern about the amount of members that are there and some of the decision s that are being made. So if we can see how many people are on this board if there are plans to put anybody else on this board and where the administration is going from there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. The second one is, I did take a look at the license s coming in and I did notice that 430 of the 530 rental registration licenses came in in the month of March alone. I think there was only about 100 in the months of January and February . If we could just send a correspondence to Eileen Cipriani just to see what the difference is with March if we're doing something correct here. I'm glad to see that many rental registration licenses are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 coming in. And then the third thing is, I do know -- since we did speak about it in caucus tonight , I do know that Mr. McAndrew is going to bring it up. But I just I wanted to touch on the finance piece. And it was mentioned in public comment tonight . On the bill list that we got or on the -- we had in the HR Department we had $97,397 were spent in the month of March for professional services for our labor counsel . Looking into it a little bit for the year 2022, $162,441 have been spent so far. So I was just going to have Mr. Voldenberg reach out to our Business Administrator to see if we can get an itemized list for billing for labor Council . And that is all. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MS. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Just one thing tonight . I had mention ed this in caucus. I'll mention it during our meeting as well. Towards the end of last year after the budget was passed, I had mentioned that I would really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 like to begin having budget conversations earlier this year and to have our plans settled going into the summer and the fall. And I would like to revisit those conversations again and send communication s to Mr. West to find out when we could have a discussion about that and set up some dates for meetings . And I'll stay in communication with Councilman Schuster as well as Chair of Finance . That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I do. So we spoke in caucus (inaudible ) sorry. So I think you heard the first part, right, if you blink it's going to be May. You never know with today's weather . Every week Miss Hodowanitz comes in and asks about the updates of the contract s and administration always assures us that it's happening in a timely manner and negotiations are taking place. Well, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Safety, I've had the opportunity to speak to board members from the Fire Department , the Police Department , and I even 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 talked to somebody from the DPW. And what they told me is, well, the Fire Department maybe they met -- not maybe. They met once. And then they also had a healthcare presentation . They're not counting that as negotiations and I don't blame them. So what's happening is and the police they met twice supposedly next week. And for DPW, I think they said they met twice. And the issue I'm having is, I'm hearing that the lawyers are meeting and fine-tuning the negotiations . I'm hearing from the executive boards, the negotiating teams from the unions that -- well, they're not getting any information . And as to what Schuster said -- Mr. Schuster , you know, they're billing us -- billing everybody in this room, the labor counsel . They're spending money on something . And it's not sit-down negotiations . They only sat down once with the Fire Department , maybe twice with the Police Department and twice with DPW since January . So I would like to make a motion to clarify because I'm hearing every different -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 different things from different sides. So for clarity 's sake, I would like to make a motion to request a timeline slash meeting dates that actually occurred with the union representatives sitting down with administration , not lawyers talking to lawyers and billing us for all three expired contracts . Could you please do that, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MS. SCHUSTER : I will second that. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , can we also include in that, can we get how many proposals have been submitted to each? MR. MCANDREW : I don't want to get into the specific s of it. I think proposals -- I guess they would be able to release that, not the specifics thereof ; but how much back. I could speak to that. So I heard one proposal was delivered to the Fire Department at 9:00 before a meeting , the first meeting. So how can you read through , digest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 at 9:00 at night meeting the next day. So I heard of one. And then I heard the police was even a little more alarming . They were given the proposal in the morning the day of negotiations . So, I mean, if you want to throw that in there I'm okay with that. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster 's part, we could request a, you know, an executive session . I know that's what they'll come back with and request anyway. But, you know, if you want to get into specific s we could also -- MR. SCHUSTER : I was just looking at how many, just a number of how many. I wasn't looking into specifics , just I think it goes into how many times they met, how many proposals have been submitted by each. DR. ROTHCHILD : As I stated in caucus, I'm interested in requesting an executive session about the negotiations to get a better sense of where they are and maybe more information that we wouldn't be able to get and release to the public. MR. DONAHUE : So, Mr. McAndrew , would you be in favor of requesting both? MR. MCANDREW : Well, I don't want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 be denied because of two other pieces. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. We can send them separate . MR. MCANDREW : How about we vote on this motion -- MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MR. MCANDREW : -- and we send correspondence down for the two, you know, of course, we want an executive session for an update. I want one definitely after knowing how many dates occurred or not. Is everybody okay with that? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. All those in favor of Mr. McAndrew 's motion signify by saying eye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Is that all? MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That's all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. First off, just on public comment , just in terms of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 electric cars, there's been no, you know, final decisions on any spending of ARPA money. That's going to be a process we move through in the coming weeks and months. In terms of the fire truck, if there is OECD money or CDBG money being spent there, that was approved in the Action Plan last -- I believe it was May or June when we approved the Action Plan. And that's the only way we could spend our current allotment of CDBG money. And also -- this was also in the capital budget we approved back in September . So it's not like we haven't voted on any part of this. There has been, you know, for any CDBG money to be spent, the Action Plan needs to be approved . That was approved last year, and then it was also included in the capital budget. In terms of you -- Mr. Coyne, one of your requests last week regarding the marijuana drug bust, we did get a response from Chief Carroll who said that, you know, the outline -- the disparity between the illegal drug trade and the regulated commercial trade and the estimated street values were based on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 criminal investigations , not the dispensary prices. That was the answer we got from the Chief there. And I know Miss Schumacher brought up Wyoming Avenue. We did get an e-mail late this afternoon that the last homeowner signed off on it. So now it has to be sent to DEP to amend the original permit. I've been told that will only take a day or two to then come back and then we can, you know, then they'll have to go out and schedule work with the homeowners . And I will look into if we have a list of when each block was, you know, previously paved in the past. A couple of -- Mr. Voldenberg , would we also -- a couple weeks ago I made a request regarding the crime reports statistics and when they'll be back up on City Protect . Would we be able to follow up with Chief Carroll to see if they've made any progress to getting those -- to getting that -- the crime stats updated on the website ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll followup . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And also, I did bring up I think it was a couple weeks ago and Mr. Voldenberg reached to out to PA 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 American Water regarding manhole covers in the Oakmont section . So the one on Karen Drive were replaced. But the ones mentioned in the e-mail I gave you on Debby Drive were not. So they just wanted to see if they could get an update on that. And I'll give you this as a reference . Also got a request for a streetlight replacement at the corner of Ward Place and Harrington Avenue, which is the Weston Field area. The light's been out for almost two years. The resident states because of walking difficulties , they were unable to get the pole number. And it is dark and dangerous in the area for those just parking or using garages or walking at night. I actually stopped down there on my way to the meeting today and there was no pole number. You could see where the plaque was basically ripped off the pole. So I'll give you this too if you could check with DPW to see if they could go and investigate that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That's all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 I have for this evening . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
