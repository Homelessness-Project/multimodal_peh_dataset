Our thoughts and prayers are with his family as you mourn the loss of your loved one. Mayor Connors will always be remember ed for his endless service to the City of Scranton . Jimmy Connors would stop and listen to anyone anytime about their concerns . He truly cared about the citizens of the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 of Scranton and would help anyone at any time that they asked him.

MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON POLICE PENSION COMMISSION MEETING HELD MAY 15, 2024. 3.B. MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON /LACKAWANNA HEALTH AND WELFARE AUTHORITY MEETING HELD JANUARY 18, 2024. 3.C. SCRANTON LACKAWANNA HEALTH AND WELFARE AUTHORITY COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022 AND INDEPENDENT AUDITORS â€™ REPORT. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have one. Just so everyone knows, there's going to be a cleanup that's going to be held at the Washburn 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 Street Cemetery . It's a long time coming. That cleanup 's going to be this Saturday , July 6th from 8 a.m. to noon. So anyone that would like to come, the more the merrier . It's going to take a lot of people to clean up that cemetery . I hope to see a lot of people out. Also, with today being the 2nd, I'd like to wish a happy 4th of July to everyone . Be safe this holiday and this weekend . That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . DR. ROTHCHILD : I also wanted to wish everyone a happy 4th of July this week. I also wanted to mention the Scrantastic Spectacular that happens every year. And that will be tomorrow . I believe festivities start around 4:00. And there will be vendors and music and other events leading up to the firework display . So I hope everyone enjoys. And I also ask that people use fireworks responsibly and within our ordinance throughout the city so as to not disturb neighbors and animals and veterans or those with PTSD who might be more sensitive to the noise. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . The 4th of July, the City Hall and DPW is closed, so both trash and recyclable s will be one day behind because of being closed Thursday . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Just so, you know, I haven't forgotten the Firefighter 's Collective Bargaining Agreement is now at 455 day point since arbitration and police is 339 days and counting . So something to look forward to. I want to compliment everyone who was involved with organizing and setting up and carrying out the Flower Show over the weekend on Saturday up at Nay Aug. I have not gone to it before because chlorophyl and I don't get along. And I promised Norma that I would go up and I did. And it was wonderful . I mean, the vendors , the display s, the fairy gardens if you've been in there. I mean, it was beautifully set up. It was a lovely family 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 event. The weather didn't cooperate at the very end. There was a little bit of rain but not much. But they had everything laid out. They had entertainment . They had food. They had presentations about bees and this, that, and the other thing. It was just a marvelous event. And I understand that first place was won by a 14-year-old teenager won first place, which I thought was really pretty neat. And he was -- he thought it was the most wonderful thing to raise plants. I was just so encouraged to see young people get involved in that kind of thing. You know, they say there's nothing for the kids to do or for adults to do. You know, that's not true. After the Flower Show I wandered down to the zoo to pay my respects to Mr. Crazy Paws with the Street Cats. And I kind of like the work that they do. And I'm glad to see on your agenda that you'll be leasing the Ash Street firehouse to them for space. I think that's a good use for both the Street Cats and not letting that building 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 sit as idle until you could decide what you really want to do with it. Do you have a status on the search for the antiviolence initiative consultant ? I understand that the deadline for applications was June 27th. Has the Mayor said anything about that or the administration ? Have they got anybody applying for that as a consultant ? MR. SMURL: I have not seen anything of that as of yet. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Yeah, I'm hoping that we could get some kind of status before you leave for the August recess. And what about the RFP for the emergency operation center and training facility on Rockwell Avenue? That deadline was June 18th. Did anybody put in for that or have you heard anything ? MR. SMURL: I don't know if -- was there a meeting for the plans the other day I saw on ECTV or was that for something else? MR. VOLDENBERG : That might have been for something else, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Okay. I thought it was for that building . But I haven't heard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 anything else. MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe there is a bid opening over the next few days. MR. SMURL: Maybe it's coming. MS. HODOWANITZ : I thought that the deadline at least in the paper said June 18th was the deadline . I was wondering if anything had come up. Hopeful we'll get some kind of status on both projects before the end of July because you'll be on recess all of August. And with regard to the 4th of July, Council woman Dr. Rothchild , she is correct in that the fireworks that the city puts on on July 3rd are absolutely fantastic . Why anybody would want to go to the trouble of purchasing and shooting off their own fireworks when they got a very professional outfit doing it. Are we having the Philharmonic playing before the fireworks ? There'll be vendors . And there'll be food and there will be all kinds of things for people of all ages. When I used to live with my mother for a while, she had Alzheimer 's. And unfortunately , people on her street used to, you know, do the fireworks all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 the time. And if you ever had a relative with Alzheimer 's you'll find out very quickly that they panic with loud noise. It's almost like PTSD and, of course, the effect on pets. So be careful . Don't get hurt. And if you want a good show, come to downtown Scranton . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Mark Scarinci . MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , can we get statuses on both that antiviolence consultant and also the Rockwell Ave? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SCARINCI : Pleasant good evening , Council . If I could borrow a line from Bishop Bambera , it is so wonderful to see your familiar faces once again. I have been here a couple times last year talking about the noise issues. And I live at Mulberry Tower across the street. I have been there for over a year. Aside from the noisy parking garage, 25 feet from a truck route and 300 feet from a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 firehouse , it's a wonderful place to live. Now, when I came here from Las Vegas, I had some mental health issues. COVID-19 destroyed me. And so I'm on medication now. And I also went with the Nevada -- State of Nevada Medical Marijuana Program . And I registered and got my cannabis there. And I enjoy cannabis in the mobile home park. But when I retired -- I don't have enough money for Social Security so I couldn't afford the law rental. I couldn't afford the mortgage . I couldn't afford the utilities . I couldn't afford to eat. I had $10 in my pocket after I paid all of these bills. So I got in Section 8. And I'm over there at Mulberry Towers. And I transferred all of my information from Las Vegas to the State of Pennsylvania Medical Marijuana Program . I went to a licensed physician . I paid my fee, got the card. And then I paid for the cannabis in a legal dispensary over here on Washington Avenue. And I went into my room. And I was having an anxiety attack. So I smoked a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 reefer. And what happened was, was since that building does not have a very good heating ventilation and air conditioning unit, it's all single units, there's called a back draft. In every room on the hallway there's a gap of about 3 inches. And when there is a window open on one side and a window open far away on the other side, it creates a back draft and you could actually feel the air coming underneath the door. And you could smell all of that odor of the dirty carpet and someone 's fried kielbasa they burned. So what happened was, the lady down the street -- I mean, the hallway after getting off the elevator and losing all of her money in the casino, she smelled that weed that I was smoking . She ran to the apartment manager and she squealed on me. And next thing you know, I look on the door and I got an eviction notice. It specifically says you have 30 days to get out of here because you were smoking marijuana . And then she gave me another one in my mailbox , two of them. So she really don't like me smoking marijuana . Do you know this lady here, Council ? It's hard to see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 but her name is Emmy Kinkead . She is sponsoring a bill in the House 2500 with our next door neighbor over here in the town of Luzerne , Aaron Kaufer, what a nice man he is. God bless him. We're going to vote recreational marijuana very soon, Council . And when that happens, the landscape of cannabis is going to change in this city. So we have to find a solution , Council , to have someone like me who is on Section 8 can smoke cannabis in their room. And I told that exact same situation to Emily. And she said because you're on federal land, you can't smoke that. You are violating federal laws on marijuana . Now, if my memory serves me correct , there's 40 states that either have recreation al or medical . The Mexican government decriminalized marijuana years ago. Canada decriminalized marijuana years ago. But the United States is not going to decriminalize marijuana , Council . And they are not going to deregulate it. It is a mountain of paperwork , immeasurable . That's why for 10 years no one wants 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 to touch it. So here's the solution , Council . This is the solution -- may I hand it to you, Mr. Tom? Can I hand this to you? It's an article . MR. SMURL: And, sir, wrap up. You're out of time. MR. SCARINCI : One more, I don't come here very often. So the people of Las Vegas, the city council , they are very smart. And so what they did was they're going to incorporate cannabis lounges in Las Vegas. We are very professional people here. We cannot call them cannabis -- I mean pot lounges . You have to call them cannabis lounges . And so I just wanted to summarize that whole article here right in here. We like to smoke. And it's nice to have a place to sit and relax Jason Price said. They visited the nearby area 15 entertainment district before heading over to planet 13. Lounge specialist Manny Gonzales brought out their order of different cannabis flowers commonly referred to as buds in a bong. We had an awesome day -- MR. SMURL: Mark, you're a couple minutes already . Thank you. We'll have to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 you in next week. MR. SCARINCI : The point is, I want to see cannabis lounges here in Scranton so a person like me who is disable d mentally could smoke marijuana so I don't get any kind of flak from the government . MR. SMURL: All right. MR. SCARINCI : Good-bye, Council . MR. SMURL: Good-bye. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler . Now I come tonight with a heavy heart. My thoughts and prayers are with Jimmy Connors ' whole family, especially his wife Susie. I knew the both of them for years. Jimmy is Irish. Susie is Jewish. He would come to the synagogue with Susie every high holiday . I would see him there. One of the best men that you would ever want to meet in this world. He was so nice to everybody . He was a champion for this city even before he was Mayor and after he was Mayor. Jimmy always said to me whether I met him out at an affair or talked to him on the phone, you know, he said, Les, if you need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 help with anything just give me a call. Last year he had business cards made up. He gave me a business card. He said, Les, give me a call if you have any problems . I'll see if I could help you out. This card is going to be in my wallet for the rest of my life. I'll remember Jimmy by that. I can't say enough good words about the man. I'm going to miss him terribly and I know his whole family is. I was at the viewing yesterday from -- I was about half a block down Linden Street. From where I was standing until I got out the church was like an hour an 10 minutes . That was a testament to what kind of man Jimmy was. Everybody loved him. Nobody had a bad word to say about him. So that's all I could say is rest in peace my friend. Last week there was some things said about who the DPW Director is. I know we don't have one. I heard from a good source, somebody I've known for years. I'm not going to say his name but saw him over the weekend . And he told me the Fire Chief, John Judge is the temporary DPW Director . If that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 true, this is ridiculous . This administration is in a shambles . I don't know how many DPW Director s we've had since Tom Preambo was forced out of office. They said he resigned. The Mayor forced him out of office. He was doing a hell of a job. And since then, they've had countless DPW Directors as well as multiple directors of all the other departments . There's a revolving door for all the department s in this city. I don't remember that ever happening in my life living in this city my whole life. We have incompetent leadership right at the top. Next thing, famous hole on Dorothy Street still not filled in because I went by it before I came here tonight . It's been like four weeks since I said it wasn't filled in. Maybe if we had a good DPW Director , it would have been done. I know Tom Preambo was in charge, it would have been done the next day because Tom told me he watched the meetings. And I know that for a fact because I came here the one night and he heard me say -- I forget what the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 problem was. He had it fixed the next day. He got the job done. Lastly, yesterday I'm coming down the McDade Expressway . I get off at the Main Avenue exit, I make the turn. I see two women there pulling weeds out from where you make the turn to under the railroad viaduct . They had -- must have had half a dozen bags of garbage and weeds and everything . I don't know who those women were, but I commend them. They did a great job. They didn't have to do that. I don't know who they were. They were volunteers I guess. But they did a wonderful job where they were working yesterday . And I commend them. I wish I knew who they were because they deserve a commendation . That's all I have. I wish everybody a safe and happy 4th of July. And I hope there's not too many of these fireworks that these people shoot off because I know my dog and my daughter 's dog, they are just terrorized . And they are not legal to shoot off in the city. I know the police can't be everywhere . I know I called last year and they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 said they would be up and they never came up. What are you going to do? The only thing I could hope for is it poured rain, but it's not suppose d to. Anyway, thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . First off, I'd like to see a motion tonight to change the Scranton Express way that they named Biden Expressway to Mayor James Connor. He was a true Scranton resident . And he was the people's mayor and he was a great friend. That's who we should be honoring on the Scranton Expressway . It should be Mayor Connors . Biden mentioned Scranton in his embarrassing debate as though we were all supporting him here in Scranton . Well, I for one am not. I'm an American . I'm a Republican . And I'm an American patriot . And on top of that, I'm a Trumpster because I believe what happened in the past Biden destroy ed and created a hell of a mess in this country . And he demonstrate d that the other night when he spoke. Being a lifelong resident of Scranton , I believe we have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 right to stand up here and defend ourselves because we're being embarrassed by Biden saying Scranton -- Interstate 81 with a sign Scranton Biden Express way, Biden's town. This isn't Biden's town. Biden is a Delaware resident and people better wake up and understand it. He didn't do a damn thing for this city. The other part is, I don't see the Israeli flag, the Ukraine flag that I went out of my way, bought them and devoted to here to see with that devotion that we respected all of those being butchered and murdered in Israel and in Ukraine . Does that mean because we won't fly them we're support ing Hamas, a bunch of murdering butchers , men, women, and children ? All of those imbeciles running around yelling we're Palestinian Hamas, every one of those clowns that went to colleges have the nerve to stand out there, get the hell out of our country . You don't belong here if you're for butchers , murders , rapers, beheading children and everything else. We need to pave Lackawanna Avenue on the upper end up by the hotel. I mean, it's an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 embarrassment . You drive in Scranton . You get on the main expressway here and you bounce all over the bloody place. We should be able to pave it. And on top of that, I think we should put something in here for the hearing impaired when they come up here and speak so they could listen and enjoy what's going on in a proper dialogue . And if Bill Gaughan was here he'd be very upset that his little lights aren't working here. You know, you'd probably send him out to a bar somewhere to drink because he would really be depressed all the trouble he went through to make these little lights work to shut people up, wants to put thousands of dollars over in the county. But moving on what we're doing here, what's the future of this city? What are we trying to do here to bring people in here? Biden opened up the borders . We have all the illegals coming into our city. We have shootings. We have robberies . We can't leave our doors open anymore, yet we want to sit here and patronize and honor a guy who is destroying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 America . Our fellow vets, he made the statement that really ticked me right off. Our fellow vets in Afghanistan that he said nobody died on his watch. Was he that stupid and dumb that he didn't realize that he killed 14 of our American soldiers ? Okay, Joan, you know where I'm coming from. As you all well know, Joan is a former colonel in the United States Army. Okay, and we're all proud to be veterans of our country . But for him to embarrass publicly , not only that, the other people that got killed, how many American s were left in Afghanistan on his watch. And you people here want to leave his name on the expressway . I'd like to see a motion before I leave here tonight to change that expressway and honor Mayor James Connors because he's one hell of a friend of the people. And he was a people's Mayor. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. That's all for the sign-in list. Anyone else wish to address Council ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MS. DALE: Good afternoon . My name is Cara Dale. I live in the Penwood section of Scranton which is right up from Minooka back behind the Stafford Avenue post office. Off my backyard is the Scranton Housing Hilltop Manor. And off my backyard is their actual playground. Now, I've lived here in my neighborhood my whole life and now I own a home in the same neighborhood , not really no problems ever, pretty quiet at all times except for the last two weeks. It's actually kind of drove me crazy because I found out that there was a nondenomination al church -- Steamtown Church was setting up a carnival of sorts in the playground area. They had bullhorns. They had speakers with their music. The speakers with the music was literally my fence is here. The backyard I have a stockade fence was right there against it. I went over to appeal to them to, you know, keep the noise down. You know, my dogs were frighten ed. They wouldn't even come off the deck to go into the backyard . It's just I had my windows shut. I had the TV up. And I could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 still hear them. Now this was from they started setting up after 4:00 until 9:00 at night. I found out that they planned on being there this summer every day Monday through Friday from 5:00 until 9:00 at night. I thought I was going to lose my mind. So I started -- I took a day off work to start making phone calls. I called the permit office, found out it's private property . You don't need a permit to be there. I called the Scranton Police. I just spoke to the front desk officer and I found out they could do whatever they want if they're given permission to be there. And this is all before Hilltop housing had opened in the morning . And I said you mean to tell they could they play the music as loud as they want and I have no recourse ? And he said, no, it's a church and they are pretty much untouchable as long as they are given permission . I asked if I could put my speakers back there and blast my music, but, no, only the church. So a little bit later in the morning the manager of Hilltop Housing called 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 me back. I left her a message. She knew nothing of them being there. So I then spoke at large. She gave me security 's number. I was advised to call them if they showed up again. So they are sneaking on after the office closes at 4:00. What happened then when I called security at that same night -- I think he went up -- I thought they were finished . They kind of closed up early. But I think it was because of rain they left about 6:30 and security comes on at 6:30 as well. So I really thought maybe that was it. No, they were back. You know, I was going to go out of my mind. I think that was a Friday. So then come next week, I'm making phone calls. I spoke to -- Wendy at the office, she found out they had it up on their website for the church. Now, this does not involve the Hilltop kids. This is only the church members . Once they leave, everything 's gone. It's dead quiet. And they were leaving a mess there too she told me. They didn't want them there. Her manager did not want them there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 So I thought how can this go on. Well, I come to find out that the Mayor authorized them to be there so there was nothing I could do. I thought this is insane, called police and, you know, they'll go over. I think they had to move the speakers from my yard. But still, there are about 100 kids there. Can you imagine 100 kids off your backyard and I don't get home until about 4:30 in the evening . So they're in full swing by 5:00 until it's dark. I go to bed at 10. I have an hour to myself if I wanted to go in my backyard . Like I said, my dogs were terrified . So I'm here. They haven't been there yesterday or today. But I'm here to appeal to you, please, find out why this is going on. I spoke to -- well, I left a message for the Scranton Housing Director Karl Lynott. He again just said Mayor authorized it, nothing , you know, he could do about it. I left a message at the Mayor's office. I have not received a phone call back from them either. I mean, do I call the police every night that they're there? I don't know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 what to do. I'm really at wit's end. I lost sleep. I, you know, missed work. I took a day off work just to make these phone calls. And I literally can't stand it. MR. SMURL: Okay. Did you -- you said you spoke to the director or who runs the housing project up there, the person? MS. DALE: The person who is the manager at the Hilltop complex , her name is Wendy Lucciano , I believe . She does not want them there. MR. SMURL: Did she call the police or ask -- call the Police Chief's office and notify them that she does not want them there? MS. DALE: She couldn't because Karl Lynott told them that they are allowed there because the Mayor gave them permission . So if they have permission to be there, they could be there. MR. SMURL: Will you leave an e-mail address or phone number with Kathy? I will ask the Mayor tomorrow morning . And I'll find out what's going on. MS. DALE: Yeah, I don't know if they changed their plans; but from what the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 woman who was in charge of this -- I don't know what it's called. I don't even know why they're not at Connell 's Park. There's Nay Aug Park. They're literally right off my back yard. I asked why. They are plugging into the power of other -- the people who live there. They also had a hose run so they could fill little pools up. MR. SMURL: Okay, if you'll leave contact information with Kathy and I will call and find out tomorrow . MS. DALE: Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxes paid. You know, every now and then I have to just drop what I was going to talk about and mention this. September , 2020, 20 million doses of vaccine cancelled by the president . Then you had the January 6th issue, 28 million given to Israel recently in aid. It's either 26 or 28. Ukraine was -- aid to Ukraine was delayed for eight to ten months by a bunch of southern Baptist s. Oh, well, Putin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 is a born again Orthodox Christian , whoop-de-do. Whatever you want comments about NATO. Deficit , the tax cut doubled the average deficit in 2022. Oh, by the way, that train wreck out in Palestine , Ohio, that train wreck was based on 2018, 2018 repeal of safety rules. A few weeks after they had that wreck, they laid off a fifth of their maintenance workforce with BNFS Railroad . And Afghanistan , well, in 9/11/23, they met with Donald Trump at Camp David. And they were actually -- a rumor probably, possibly he was going to take those mugs into the White House into the oval room. And, of course, you know, just like Iraq, just like everybody else, we kick the can to the next guy's term. So if you don't make it, you know, you could blame the other guy. And if you do make it you could tell everybody to shut the hell up or you are going to call out your guard. It's threatening everyone with arrest and stilly stuff. You know there are two types of aging dementia . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 One is kind of like, you know, people get a little quieter and a little less sure of themselves . And the other one is you can't take -- you can dress them up but you can't take them out because they'll start some kind of trouble somewhere . It just gets ridiculous . I could go on and on and on. I just wrote this list out of my memory. There's about seven or eight things here. And as far as Donald Trump is concerned with me, Joe might be an embarrassment every now and then with his gaffs and big blanking deal with the Obama Care and stuff. But Trump is a damn insult. He's a disgusting person that is only out for his himself and only wants to wreck other people's lives for his entertainment . He will probably put us in a coliseum and make us fight each other, you know. And I think they were talking about something like that too recently . And on the city in my neighborhood they took all of the blue stone curbs. Now they are promising up in East Mountain , oh, we're going to fix that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Don't plan on it. I have to get on them. And I guess the answer is to go up and down the street to get signatures from everybody to complain because there is soil washing into the street and everything else. And that's going to block up sewers. Well, don't worry about it. They could raise our rate. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. COYNE: Good evening , members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . First off, tonight I'm ashamed to be an American with the last late Supreme Court ruling. The founders ' intent of the legislature , executive , and judicial system was to have checks and balances . But we have a Supreme Court who are not bound by ethics, a Congress that makes laws and exempts themselves from it. And we now have a king for president . Right now as it stands, Mr. Biden can order the members of the Supreme Court who defended this rule to be arrested and shipped to Guantanamo and kept incognito as an act of insurrection on the Constitution . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 As an official act he has total immunity and the authority to do this. The Supreme Court ruled that the President is only beholden to an act of Congress for a prosecution and impeachment . That's all well and good. But that's a high bar to start with. And in that process , the President then could lock up anyone who would dare to vote impeach him under those same powers. We stand in the darkened footstep s in Germany and the Weimar Constitution and the use of Article 48. Happy 4th of July. Now moving onto city business , last year Mr. Schuster asked at the end of winter to evaluate the status of the pools so during the hot summer days the pools would not be shut down for repair. Why does Council need to ask for this? The director should be doing that long before the season opens. Is this really necessary for Council to instruct the Parks Department how to operate every year? Last week I erred. I need to correct a statement I made. Something in the back of my head told me I was making a bad 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 quote so I went back to check. I stated on the average there were two deaths a year at the Nay Aug Park gorge versus the five shooting s we already had this year alone. The fact reported by Jim Lockwood on July 10th of 2022, 48 people died in or near the gorge since 1890 when the newspaper started reporting fatalities . So I was in error. The gorge does not have a fatality rate of two every years. But in the 134 years of history , it had 48 deaths. That's one death short of every two years and ten months. Part of these numbers are based also on transportation and emergency care to hospital s from the early 1900s. We fixate on issues that are of minor importance . We ignore the larger issues. No doubt we're going to hear tonight about long grass and this evening ask Mr. Voldenberg to ask License and Inspections to get on it. But we're not talking about pothole s. We have a side of the building that collapse d a few buildings down, a dilapidated wall to the entrance of city forever crumbling but focus on the grass. How about enough of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 that? Onto tonight 's docket, 5-B on the disable parking . Why it changing from handicap and disabled when the fine in there is actually reducing it by $5 and not increasing it? The fine should be increase d to $75 from 55, not reduced. There needs to be a requirement to immediately tow offenders . As it stands now, you get a ticket. That's it. In other cities you park in a handicap space, you get a ticket. And if you are not there by the time the tow truck pulls around, your car is gone. Why is towing not in that legislation ? Last on 5-E, there is some odd conflict s and inconsistencies . Listed in the cover is a max eight hours per month. In the bid it's 10 hours per week. The fee is not to exceed $20,000 on the cover of page two. But on the bid page, it notes that the actual contract calls for 10 hours a week and a monthly cost of $7,680. It states in the body a commitment up to 40 hours a month but not to exceed covers two and one half months on a yearly contract . The cover and the bid do not match. Something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 is wrong with that. And last on the curfew, all of you tell me that you do not remember , "It's 10:00. Do you know where your children are?" And you cannot remember from childhood the siren over in Taylor going off at 9 or 10:00 to warn kids it's time to get home. But I guess we don't care about children anymore. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. CUSICK: Good evening , Council . My name is Amy Cusick. I am from the West Scranton area. I am the founder and president of Chris's Miracles From Heaven. I first and foremost want to thank the community for all of their support . We have been working on the Washburn Street Cemetery project . This Saturday is going to be our third visit at the cemetery . I am a resident of West Scranton . I literally live two blocks away. My grandparent s are buried there, my great grandparents , and my great, great grandparent s. I will tell you that when I first started this project I didn't know what I was getting myself into. It is a disgrace to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 West Scranton Community and to Scranton in general . When first started the project , the very first time, we found 15 veterans ' graves that you would not even know that were there. We were pulling back grass. The grass was so matted you could see the markers on the grass. That's how bad it was. This past Saturday we had 12 members come and volunteer their time to help us. And again, we found 20 veterans ' graves, no markers , no flags no nothing because the grass is just that high. The grass is literally up to my hips in that cemetery . Since we've been on WNEP this past Saturday , my phone has not stopped ringing . I'm getting calls from Florida , South Carolina , New Jersey. I had a lady drive up to Scranton from New Jersey today to look at it because she couldn't believe what she saw on my Facebook lives. And she stopped at my house in tears. Her father is buried there and he is a Civil War veteran -- or great grandfather , I'm sorry. She has commend ed us for all of our efforts . Now, I have found out who the owner of the Washburn Street Cemetery is. And I've 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 done research . It seems like this has been an ongoing problem with this owner for years, for years. Many nonprofits besides ourselves have been there to do work on this cemetery . No repercussions are done to the owner of the Washburn Street Cemetery . And the community wants answers as to why not? Why are we held accountable for our grass and putting stuff on our porch and getting fined by the official s but why isn't he? I'm not here to bash him. I understand he's in hard times and my heart aches for him. But there's other ways that we could fix the Washburn Street Cemetery , come together as a community and hold him accountable for not taking care of his property just like I would be held accountable and anybody else in this room be held accountable for not taking care of their property . And that's really all that I have to say. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Did you get permission from -- MS. CUSICK: I'm sorry? MR. SMURL: I asked you during the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 week if you would get permission from the owner to enter the property . Have you contacted them at all or -- MS. CUSICK: I have contacted him. I've even asked to meet me for dinner. I've left messages and no return phone calls. I've heard that this is basically what has happened in the past as well. And another nonprofit told -- basically told him he could still have ownership but they wanted to raise funds and maintain it and just have a community place where we could walk our dogs, teach our sons and daughters how to ride their bike and raise money and take over the maintaining of it because he doesn't have the funding for it. And he said, "Unless I'm getting the money, I don't want no part of it." MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. MS. CUSICK: You're so welcome . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. CLARK: My name is Bill Clark. To follow up with her, Amy, I spoke to her for the first time on Sunday. Memorial Day took me four hours to clean up graves at Washburn Street to make it presentable . I then sent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 letters to the Commissioners . I sent letters to the Mayor. I sent a letter to the Editor to the Scranton Times. Unfortunately , the new owners don't hate Scranton like the old ones do because they wouldn't put it in because I mentioned Hillary 's name because her father is in that cemetery . But like Amy said, I'm afraid to actually see people get in there and do something and then the owner come in and say, hey, you know, you're on -- you're on my property . She stated tonight to me that a plot can't even be purchased at the Washburn Street Cemetery anymore. Why? That's -- it's a -- it just shows that the city isn't looking out for the veterans . My father is 79 years old. And he told me after I took him through there last week we have approximately 17 people there. And I know at least 50 that he doesn't want to be buried there. He was a West Sider his whole life. He said bury me somewhere else. This is disgusting . Like Amy, I want this whole 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 process to start, you know, you're going to need people with machines to pick up all the stones. The stones are laying on the ground. You need people to cut the grass. I mean, now it's hay. So it is a deplorable sight to anyone that drives through there. I sent a letter to the editor a couple years ago. And, you know, and it got back with me that, you know, they wanted support . But the local funeral directors would not even allow people to go into that cemetery for the burial because they were embarrassed to take people from out of the state to that cemetery to show them where the person was being buried. So I ask that everybody , not only Amy's group, the city, the commissioners -- like I said, we need that to become like Cathedral . Channel 16 showed Memorial Day weekend , beautiful things at all kinds of cemeteries for veterans , couldn't do anything there. You know, and it's an embarrassment . But again, hopefully it's heard this time and something happens . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta , Scranton . We're here again tonight regarding Washburn Street Cemetery . Do you remember when I presented the issue to City Council back of May of 2022 along with dozens of picture s. Where are those picture s? Does anybody know who has them? What do you do when somebody present s something to City Council ? Do you throw it away because we know you don't shred stuff. I brought the condition of the Washburn Street Cemetery up a second time on May 28th, 2024, which was a year later to Scranton City Council . Is there any reason when a resident brings up an issue or concern it isn't addressed until it becomes a major dilemma ? What do you do when city residents ask you questions ? How do you follow up? Do you ever follow up on anything for us? So tonight , I ask that Scranton City Council demand that the city administration instruct code enforcement officers to refrain from issuing quality of life citation s and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 fines regarding high grass and weeds to all city residents until the City of Scranton maintain s all city property from high grass and weeds. Then the City of Scranton can lead by example that they set for the city residents to follow. It's only fair. It shouldn 't be do as we say not as we do in Scranton . Was the Washburn Street Cemetery ever issued a quality of life citation or a warning ? And if so, what was the outcome . And if it wasn't, why not? So does Council plan on address ing the issue regarding the no weekend dispatch operator for the DPW in the event of an emergency and issues? Emergencies do not just happen Monday to Friday nine to five. You understand that, right? The DPW is now in charge of traffic signals . Do you know that? Once again, the lights on North Main Avenue were black and there was no one to address it all weekend . We need to address that, Council , and why we don't have a dispatcher and why the police have to beg to get somebody to come out on the weekend . I'll ask this one once again. Do we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 have the number of applicants that passed and the number of applicant s that failed the new National Testing Network Scranton Patrolman Test that closed in June? It shouldn 't be so hard to get the results . Do we have the number of applicants prior to Covid that took the LEAB Police Patrolman Test versus the number of applicant s who had taken the new NTN Patrolman Exam Test? So what I'm asking is whether the number of applicants were with the change to the new testing and the results if more candidates passed or failed. It shouldn 't be that hard to get us an answer, Council . We pay you guys and we pay you very well. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher , city resident . I was happy to see 4-C and what's going on with the Engine 15. However , is that going to be revenue ? Is there a -- do you know? MR. SMURL: What is? MS. SCHUMACHER : Will there be revenue from Street Cats and Dogs? MR. SMURL: Our first goal is to see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 what we can actually -- what we really want to do with that structure . So right now we're looking at doing like a basic six month temporary lease to Street Cats to see if they could utilize the building . They are going to pay one dollar for six months for the building . And we're going to decide -- the administration will decide what the best use for that building will be. I'm hoping that the Street Cats are able to take over the building and then utilize it. But I really don't want to see the building sold. I would rather keep any asset the city has. I really don't want it sold. So whether we lease it to Street Cats or whomever, but this is just a temporary lease to alleviate some of the problem s we have right now with cats and just overflow from all of the problem s that we've been having with stray animals . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you for that. I guess now the other thing I want is pools. I knew that there wasn't a Nay Aug pool this year and, you know, and then I came down by Connell Park and said, my goodness , there's a pool. There's not a drop of water in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 it. And then I went by Weston Field and same thing. They're doing something , making another pool it appears . But how many pools do we actually have in this city and how many are filled with water and useable ? MR. SMURL: The three that are down, Connell Park, last year there was massive leaks up there. That is -- that went up for bid to be refurbished . But we did try to start it at the beginning of this year. It did not work. And probably eight weeks ago we got the report. They tried to reseal it again and nothing worked. And that's after 30 years of neglect . That didn't happen in two years. The Weston Field Project , that entire project has begun. That means there's going to be a new pool, a new playground. The bathhouses were taken down because they were falling down. The old structure that housed the grass cutting of our city -- I can't remember what they do -- Parks and Recreation , they are no longer in that structure . That structure was falling down. It all had to come down. So that is all gone. All that will be all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 rebuilt. They are actually up at the Serrenti Center right now. That's where they're keeping all of their equipment . So we decided not to put any more money into Connell Park, instead move forward with the entire revamp of the whole structure . That would have been a waste of money to try to patch it again. It wouldn't have gone through the year. And it would have been just throwing money away. So the wise thing to do was to move forward with it. And everything is finished . We just have to redo the pool over. MS. SCHUMACHER : So it will be in next year's budget. MR. SMURL: No, it's already done. MS. SCHUMACHER : The Connell Park. MR. SMURL: Connell Park, yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : It's all done. MR. SMURL: Yeah, we just have to move forward with the construction . We just decided not to try to repair it for this summer. It would have just been a waste of a lot of money. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. SMURL: Okay. Anyone else? MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , proud resident , raised, educated in the City of Scranton . Tonight I want to talk to you this evening about a glass ceiling , our current climate and what the city is starving for. The glass ceiling that I'm referring to is Mayor Jim Connors . First time I met Mayor Connors was when he approached the offices of Tom Galella . My mother had the ability to work for Tom as her office -- as the office manager . And he approached the office, walked in, shook my hand and talked to Tom about running for Mayor. And, you know, that's how everything got started in West Scranton . You know, he had his back up against the wall running as a Republican in a dominant Democratic city. So with that being the case, pushed him even harder. He walked around with one of these wherever he went. He answered every request . He knew your name. And he resolved the issues, wrote everything down and then crossed it off as he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 got through his day. All right. As far as I'm concerned , that's our glass ceiling . You know, since then we've been starving for somebody to shatter that ceiling . You know, my ability to talk to him and share some things with him started three weeks after he took office. The lights went out on the Scranton Central Expressway . Tom Galella called me and he said to me, you know, he was the City Treasurer at the time. He said to me, he said, Mike, he said, the lights went out $110,000 to fix them. The city was responsible for them at the time. I said, why don't you just give the property to the state. Did that, three weeks later the lights went back on, never had to maintain that property again, you know, all of that money saved. I told him, I said, I hope you keep all the pools open. Twelve years, he did just that, budgeted around pools, parks and recreations , kids were his first responsibility because that was our future. He worked every day 12 years. He had great people that worked with him. Tom 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Galella . You know, we went into a distressed status. The administration didn't do that. City Council did. They had doubts. Well, guess what? They were wrong. Twelve years, didn't raise taxes once, very creative , kept all the pools open. Since then things have changed . You know, he listened to the people, listened very tentatively . And on occasion took my ideas, placing account s for collection , delinquent accounts , also trash fees. You know, I introduced him to the Mayor of Allentown . And that's how that all started . You know, since then we have this current climate and someone who is not even from here, somebody who doesn't conduct business very well, somebody who would rather put doors on a building , chain on the steps and just keep everybody away, right to knows with no intentions on making people transparent of what's truly going on. You know, kids in South Side have to go to North Scranton to swim. The reason why that pool is like that because there's no cover. We're not proactive with anything that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 we do. All right. Year and a half from now 2026, I hope we get beyond this because this city is starving for somebody with a backbone , somebody who is not a chosen one, somebody who is not the next in line, somebody who's not with the most dollars and the most sense or the highest mailing list, somebody who truly cares about our city who is willing to put them above themselves and do what's right, you know, somebody that's willing to pop open boxes and computers and whatever instead of popping corks on day one. This city is starving for something special . Something special is needed because something is coming through , a railway system in the not so distant future. And our current climate is going to get worse. We're right now 185 in the country for trash. Number three is Reading . Allentown is in the top 100, Philadelphia . That's rolling this way. You know, so as far as I'm concerned , we had a glass ceiling . We're starving for somebody to shatter that. He walked around with one of these for a very long 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 time. And he answered every question . And, you know, Mr. Schuster I saw you writing a lot of stuff down. It's good to be present . We need people that are present to write down the right questions and come up with the right answers and follow through because those that are just here, all they do is just share property address es and stuff like that. You can do that through 311, but that doesn't work either. Thank you, Mr. Schuster , for being one of the people. Good evening , Council . God bless the City of Scranton . God bless Jim Connors . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I do have a few. So first I'd like to start by saying my condolences to the Connors family. I was away when I heard the news of Mayor Connors passing and my prayers go out to him. One of my fondest memories as a kid was seeing Mayor Jim Connors sing Johnny Be Good at the church and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 neighborhood picnics . It's something I remember fondly of him. So my thought s are with his family. I'd like to follow up with some questions I had recently . I did receive some answers back. So I just want to report them out. So a few weeks ago I went through some of the pave cut receivable s over the last four years. So Mr. Schuster asked the administration if they may revisit and assist in response regarding Council questions about number six, which actually they were related to line items for pave cut receivable s for '23 and '24. So in the previous years, the pave cuts were spelled out in the budget. And I was wondering what they were and why they weren't spelled out in '23 and '24. So the answer that I got was they weren't broken out. They went to the aggregate of the department 's -- departmental earning budget line item. And it's account 100-36000360. When looking at that aggregate in these line items, in 2023 they budgeted $425,500. And what was actually received was 215,300. And the year-to-date as of September 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 was pretty spot onto that 215,000. In 2024, they only took it down $500. So they budgeted for $425,000. The year-to-date at this point in time is $40,686. So there is a huge dropoff that we're seeing here with pave cuts. It was something that I was trying to extrapolate from that information . And my concern is that when I spoke with Tom Preambo back in April of 2020, they were trying to get all of these pave cuts databased . He let me know that a third of them were permanent and we received money for. A third of them were past the two year mark possibly . And a third of them they had still had pending . So my fear is we get past that two year mark because these pave cuts are not databased . And once we get past that two year mark, they are the city's responsibility . So it's something that I want the administration to stay on. And it's something that I've -- the answer that we received last week was that they were working on it. I'm still awaiting that response of what we're doing with pave 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 cuts. Next, I asked for an update on North Scranton and Keyser Valley. West Mountain stormwater study was complet ed. And I asked for a meeting with the Meadow Brook Project , which I was happy to see that that happened. Sorry I couldn't make that meeting . I was away. But that meeting was requested and that meeting occurred . It heard it had a good turnout for residents that are affected by it. So what I got back on Keyser Valley was that stormwater project s in Keyser Valley, North Scranton , West Side, Tripp Park and Minooka are ongoing . And they're planning to get a public meeting for Keyser Valley in July. So there should be a public meeting for Keyser Valley in July, where they're going with that stormwater study there. I also asked the administration who is making the day-to-day decision s in DPW since at this point in time we do not have a director . We do not have a recycling coordinator . And we do not have a refuse coordinator . The answer I got back day-to-day 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 operations of DPW are managed by DPW manager Dennis Zackeroff {phonetic .} And he's being support ed by the Business Administrator and our Fire Chief. So it was stated at public comment tonight . And that's the answer we got back. Next, I was happy to see the community centers received money from that community center line item that Council put in in the budget. Tripp Park Community Center received one and also West Scranton (inaudible ) group. So good luck to the West Side group and happy to see that those funds were disbursed to community centers in the city. That is all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do have a few. I also wanted to mention Mayor Jimmy Connors and his passing . And, you know, I certainly felt like what Council man Smurl had said at the beginning really encapsulated what I felt as well. But he was just an incredible public servant . We were really lucky to have him as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 city. And he was at almost every community and political event that I've ever been to and just seeing his level of commitment and his care for the city, has always been an inspiration to me. So I will certainly miss him as well as so many others throughout the city. I wanted to bring up a couple of other points. One thing was a response that I had received last week on my request for along Mulberry Street for the drains to be cleared . And what I was told is that Mulberry Street will be inspected from downtown up to Nay Aug Park beginning July 1st for inspection and maintenance . So today is the second. Hopefully that has started to occur and they could begin cleaning up those drains, especially on these main thoroughfares through the city. I feel like we should have a better presentation for people who may be visiting the city or just frequently travelled roads that, you know, either have a lot of overgrown properties . I don't want to talk about grass but also things like storm drains that are not functioning properly because they are filled 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 with so much trash or dirt or debris. And next, I also wanted to thank those who have been working on the Washburn cemetery . You should not have to do that work. And I know it's been a complaint that we have received many times over. And Council has brought up and I had looked back in e-mails and saw one recently from even May 29th but just no response on what had been done with the owner. And I know what happens sometimes with other properties throughout the city is that there are quality of life tickets issued and they might not get paid. And then there might be a magistrate hearing , and the person doesn't show up to the magistrate hearing . And then there's a warrant issued. And it just keeps going on and nothing happens from that. So I'm not sure exactly where they are in the process for this situation , how many quality of life tickets have been issued or what actions have been taken. I do want those answers . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could please request from Code Enforcement what step they are in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 process and how many quality of life tickets they've received and if they have been paid. I want all of that information and to find out what we need to do now to get the property owner to take responsibility or sell the property so that someone else will be responsible and in caring for it because we certainly should not be -- it shouldn 't be in that state and for other people to have to take care of it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out tomorrow . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. I think that's all that I had. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . This first announcement was asked by Bill King about all the storm drains if they were city or PAWC and if the city would provide a listing for their review so we could respond to all of the questions we have about them. The answer was DPW will coordinate between the city's assistant planner, DPW personnel , and supervisors from Pennsylvania American Water company to provide the city with city versus PAWC storm drains. And they should 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 send us that report. The question I had about the homeless population during the heat wave, Joan, I believe this was yours. The response from the administration is there are many nonprofit organizations that assist with unsheltered population s and have supplies at their location to help mitigate the heat. This month the city is partnering with these organizations to hold a heat mitigation month in the city and a drive supplying water, powered electrolyte packets, the sunscreen and more information to follow as things progress with the other organizations . Other things were the two street sweepers I had asked for about last week. The city is only running one of them. And it is not -- it was suppose d to be following recycling route but the ultimate goal remember is that it remains the street sweeper routes intended to be with the Rubicon system which was suppose d to have been implement ed into the near future. I'm not sure where all that is at. But I guess we'll be provided information . It 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 says we had information on the 14th. But I will check into that further . There were a few things sent into Code Enforcement , 709 Colfax Avenue. I know on the Colfax I got this complaint for on the corner of Colfax and East Gibson since the street has been paved, the traffic has gotten quite fast up there. And you can't see around the entire intersection . I asked Frank, to send this to Code Enforcement to see if they could cut some shrubs back so we could see going back. Also the sidewalk , 1606-1608 Pittston Avenue, they will I hope get us a report on this week. Birney Avenue for code enforcement for the rear corner property again. And for 402 Davis Street, the building that is there -- it's just a small building . I don't know if it was condemned or if it's on the demolition list. I guess we will find out this week. The last financial update meeting I was at was last Wednesday . So what happened some information was that was the Sewer Authority audit is complete . And it is awaiting approval . And then we should have that by the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 end of this month. The Scranton Redevelopment Authority audit we should have by the end of this month and the Parking Authority audit we should have by the end of this month. A few other things I found interesting at this meeting was what we are doing with interest bearing account s. I had some question s about that with our city tax dollars and what money are we collecting interest on it or what happened . So the things we discussed at the meeting were two years ago we had made $70,909.20 on interest . And that's just on tax dollars that we have in the bank. Last year we made $130,338.96. This year the administration and Matt Domines ' were meeting with I believe it was PNC. And they had worked out a deal on the interest rate and stuff. But so far this year on our tax dollars that are sitting in the back we have made in interest $310,359.85. So we are on track for the first time in a very, very long time to make over $600,000 in interest on our tax dollars this year. And that does not include ARPA money. Mr. Schuster brought up last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 the overtime for DPW and I looked at it and it was like 82 or 83 percent used already . So I traced back -- MR. SCHUSTER : It was Parks and Rec. MR. SMURL: I'm sorry, Parks and Rec. Most of that was used during the Code Blue days where we provided shelter during the very cold weather so people didn't freeze to death. So we need to take a Parks' worker and put them at Weston Field. So being over on their budget I don't have a problem with that and that being the reason to keep people from freezing to death. I think that's acceptable . But I would pretty much consider looking into that a little more next year if we were going to continue with that Code Blue plan. I also had some questions on how we mail out our recycling schedule . And I'd asked the administration and I had also asked Kathy Weschler if we can print out a form that gives our recycling schedule . And also Dr. Rothchild had asked if we could put other things on the opposite page of the piece of paper and put it in with the taxes and have it all mailed out at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 once so we don't have to be making multiple mailouts with those cards that we send out. Other boroughs , township and stuff send everything else out as a package . Maybe not a problem , but I will contact Lackawanna County and speak with them and find out if because they do process all of this and they do the mailing . So I'm looking to add a piece of paper into it. If it changes the weight on each piece, perhaps we can join into that somehow . But if we add to it, I want to see if we could actually do that without causing any problems with Lackawanna County. I don't believe there will be. But we have to consider their job and then see if we could add into that. So Monday afternoon I went to West Scranton Community Center at 1621 Washburn Street. I have never been there before. But the building is very close to completion . The West Scranton Youth Center plans to provide after school programming in and wrestling , athletics , health and wellness education , visual and performing arts and music. And the city announced at that time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 $15,000 community grant to further help develop the youth center and also while they were there, they announce d a $10,000 grant to go to the Tripp Park Community Center on the 2000 block of Dorothy Street for maintenance and building improvements up there. I want to thank Doug Boyle and Laura Boyle for driving this project . This is something we as a community need, not only in West Side but we need this in every part of our city. We should be more involved in our youth and provide them more opportunities like this project . So all we need are more people like the Doug and Laura Boyle to run them for us. That is all I have, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION â€“ AN ORDINANCE â€“ AMENDING THE CITYâ€™S RESERVED PARKING PROGRAM FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND SEVERELY DISABLED VETERAN AND RELATED PROVISIONS . MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , this has been in the making for a while and we've had several residents come to us with concerns about their disabled parking , not having access to it in front of their properties . And so this is, you know, one of the solutions we came up with right now. Well, actually I want to thank our Solicitor for revisiting the ordinance along with the Law Department to see what other updates might need to happen with it. And the main piece in this that's the change is that if you have -- if you need the reserved parking outside of your property and you have a disabled license plate has on there that it's a handicap one, not just the placard that you have in the vehicle . But it's on the license plate and that comes from the state. Then we will take that license plate number and put it on the sign so that that spot could just be for you. So that's where the problem lies anyone could park in that spot.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 And if you had nearby businesses , then you might get someone parking there who does have a handicap placard but isn't at the that property . And then your spot is taken and you've already paid to have that spot. So we're thinking that this is the best solution . And I hope this works out for those who need it. And so I'm happy that we're able to bring this legislation forward . And I know there was some questions about it during citizens participation . And I want to ask our Solicitor about the towing specifically if that was discussed with the Law Department as another option. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Dr. Rothchild , it was. It's my understanding that is an option. However , as with everything in life, there is certain grades of first time you do it there is a certain fine and will go up. And certainly that will be at the discretion of the officer s. Well, it is a private -- I shouldn 't say private . But it's a reserved parking spot so no one really would have the right to park there so the car would be moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. So perhaps 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 that's something we could introduce it tonight and still take into consideration as a Council if that's something else that we want to add in as a consequence of someone parking in that spot illegally . I know we've had issues just with getting enforcement of people parking illegally in disabled parking spots. So, you know, I do believe that we need that to be stronger as a whole for this to work as well. That's all that I have on the question . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . MR. SCHUSTER : So on the question , those two points that were brought up in public comment tonight , I just wanted to, you know, keep them alive and explore them for some discussion . Maybe it's a possibility . Maybe there's reasons why they didn't work. Maybe it's something that, you know, could be added. But if we could just keep those two things on the table. MR. SMURL: Thank you. I also want to thank Attorney Gilbride and Council man McAndrew and also Dr. Rothchild for all of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 work they've done on this. This was a problem for a long time. And this legislation should clear up a lot of the headaches. So all those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION â€“ AN ORDINANCE â€“ AUTHORIZING A LEASE AGREEMENT WITH ST CATS & DOGS INC FOR USE OF THE PREMISES , COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE ASH STREET FIREHOUSE , AT 1409 ASH STREET IN SCRANTON . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , you know, I just want to thank Councilman Smurl for your work on this. And I'm glad that we're able to find a solution even if it's a temporary one for the cat and animal problem that we have in the city. So this will provide some additional housing for them, especially when they get into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 those hoarding cases and they are coming out with 20 animals and sometimes more that there is just not space for otherwise . And it sounds like it will also help take a little bit of the load off of our SPD and our Animal Control so that they don't have to travel as far to get them to Griffin Pond. So I just wanted to -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'd also like to add I'm glad it's a short-term lease. I don't want to see us open up a can of worms with something like this. But I think this is going to give us an opportunity to identify what the need is, how much space we may need into the future. And I think with that short term lease we'll be able to identify what that need is currently . MR. SMURL: Thank you. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-D. FOR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 INTRODUCTION â€“ A RESOLUTION â€“ FOR PLAN REVISION FOR NEW LAND DEVELOPMENT PROPOSED AT 930 HICKORY STREET, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA . MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ?

FOR INTRODUCTION â€“ A RESOLUTION â€“ AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH WOODLAND DESIGN ASSOCIATES , INC. FOR CITY PLANNING AND ZONING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES . MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , with this I think I just need a little bit of clarification . We do have a City Planner . We do have an Assistant City Planner . We do have a zoning officer . Now we're adding a contractor . So I think I'd like to, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could ask the administration to please clarify the duties of this consultant if they could please provide a list. From the backup it reads that the consulting firm is going to assist the zoning officer specifically when navigating the ordinance and helping to draft violations . So if we could see what the specific list of work this contractor will be doing. In addition , can we just get who was the author of the 2023 zoning ordinance ? And then has the administration identified any blind spots or gaps in the 2023 ordinance ? Because we've recently seen that the Zoning Board has identified some of those gaps. With that being said, will the consultant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 assist with updating and filling those gaps in that 2023 ordinance ? Also, within the backup here it says that this group will be meeting with the city within one week. This was put in in April. It was approved in May. So has the city met with this group as of now? And then there was a discrepancy in the backup of how many hours a month the consult ing firm would be working. It said 40 hours. It said eight hours a month. But can we get a definitive answer how many hours a month will the consulting firm be working on City of Scranton issues? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. MR. SMURL: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.
