GAUGHAN : Thank you. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? Mr. Voldenberg , I have one request in regard to 3-B, the minutes of the Scranton Recreation -- or the Scranton Redevelopment Authority rather. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Can you please request a copy of all properties that are owned by the SRA? Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. I would like to wish a good friend and neighbor Ray Boynton a very happy retirement and thank him for his 28 years of service at the DPW. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few announcements . First of all, I want to say L'shanah tovah. It's Rosh Hashanah , so to all those that celebrate the holiday and the new year. I also -- I wanted to mention that on Sunday, September 12th, so this coming Sunday, there will be a Scranton Recovery Walk. And that's going to start at noon. And they'll be starting from 415 North Eighth Avenue or the Hall and then they'll be ending at the Recovery Bank at 120 Wyoming Avenue. And then I just wanted to, you know, say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 congratulations for the mural that was added down on Penn Avenue for First Friday. They had a dedication for the mural. I think it came out beautiful ly and definitely adds to our downtown . I look forward to other murals coming to our City and the artist of that mural was Joel Carson Jones. So if you have a chance to take a look at it, it's right on the 300 block of Penn Avenue as you're going down there. And that's everything . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? I have a few. Due to the rising COVID-19 case numbers and the serious nature of the Delta variant , masks will be required while in Council Chambers . Please keep your mask up at all times even while speaking at the podium. Just make sure to speak into the microphone . We have 14 pieces of legislation on the agenda tonight . I just want to remind everyone from the public that all of this legislation including the backup document ation that's submitted to Council by the administration can be viewed on the City's website , www.scranton .pa.gov. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 This was a project I initiate d and pushed for several years ago to make sure that Council was as transparent as it could be. I've also made an effort since I took over as President of Council as you could see on our agenda tonight to include any correspondence and reports we get from the administration into our Third Order so that again, the public can view it on our agenda. This is good government . And if anyone in the audience or anyone from our City wants to be involved and informed which I know that all of you do, it's all there for you to read and, of course, ask Council any questions related to the legislation . And we would look forward to that. The North Scranton Neighborhood Association is having an October fest, their annual fund-raiser October 2nd, 2021 from 5 to 8 p.m. at the VFW No. 25, 2291 Rockwell Avenue. The donation is $20. It includes food, refreshment s and entertainment . There will be basket raffles and 50/50 tickets. Also an exciting event tomorrow in front of the -- in front of Scranton City Hall 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 we're having a flag raising in support of the County Mayo Ireland football team. They made it to the all Ireland Final which is going to be held on September 11th. And we are raising the flag there. It's going to be live-streamed on the Mayor's Facebook page. I know I've been in contact with a lot of people over in County Mayo who are going to be watching this live. There's a lot of excitement around it. As most of you probably know, the City of Scranton and Ballina County Mayo, Ireland are twin cities, sister cities going back to 1991 under former Mayor James Connors. So it's an exciting time for the City of Scranton . We're trying to strength en those ties between the two cities and all of the history that is behind that. And this I think is a first step in doing that. So everyone from the public is invited . Again, it will be outside tomorrow at 4 p.m., on the steps of City Hall. And this football team over there has not won a championship since 1951. So they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 are -- I consider them the Boston Red Sox before they won the World Series of sports teams in Ireland . So we wish them the best of luck. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton resident . You could give me these answers during Fifth Order. First, what is the status of the City's audit still on track for an October completion date? MR. GAUGHAN : Miss Hodowanitz , can you hang on one second while we fix the clock? I don't want to cheat you out of any time here. MS. HODOWANITZ : Next, I see that the renaming of Spruce Street is still a hot topic in the newspaper and on talk radio. How about this as a solution , name the Pocket Park on the corner of Wyoming and Linden for Biden and leave Spruce Street alone. That way, no resident s or business owners will be affected . Next, with regard to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Controller 's July report, why did we have to pay Rainey and Rainey $5,940 for work that should be done in the BA's office? Also, didn't we agree that extraordinary numbers should be footnoted ? On page three there is a special item expenditure of $3,649,425.04. Don't bother asking the Controller 's Office. It reflects two TAN payments and two bank leases under non departmental items. But I shouldn 't have had to do that research . Next, according to the Single Tax Office's July year-to-date figures , the City has had a 17.7 percent decrease in LST EMS revenues . Is that going to be a problem in the future? Next, I see that the City's minimum municipal obligation for 2021 is 14,900,000 dollars . Do we have that money in this year's budget? Next, what is City Council 's response to the HARB report on the demolition of the Plotkin 's Shoe Store on Penn Avenue? Next, I was pleased to see the detailed information contained in the capital 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 budget. That is, I was pleased until I saw that the breakdown of numbers in the narrative portion of the budget did not match the numbers in the accompanying spreadsheet . Someone needs to edit the document . Also, I think the IT Department needs more than $155,000 in 2021. They have more than their share of technical problems . Next, it's great that individuals and organizations donate so generously to the City. Are all of those donations forward ed to the Ethics Board for their review? If not, why not? And finally , I looked for the labor agreements on the City's website . Guess what? The firefighter and Single Tax Office agreement s were there -- well, sort of. IT posted the 2018 changes to the basic agreements , not the basic agreements themselves . And that's what I want. I do not see how the City can negotiate new labor agreements without having access to the basic document . And if the City has it, it should be on the website for review by all citizens . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Richard Laurito . MR. LAURITO : Richard Laurito , 2805 South Webster Avenue. I spoke at the last two Council meeting s in favor of renaming the Central Scranton Expressway and Spruce Street in honor of Joseph R. Biden, Jr. I also spoke in favor of the job that both City Council and Mayor Cognetti are doing. Prior to the previously mentioned meetings , I have never met or spoken to anyone on Council or Mayor Cognetti . I'm not here to artificially prop up their standing or position in the community . I am here to further the prosperity and beauty of the City I grew up in. This evening I have a couple dozen numerical facts I would like to share with Council , the audience , and residents of Scranton. I have read many editorials since the last Council meeting . They have overwhelmingly been opposed to renaming the roadways . They have accused Council and specifically President Bill Gaughan of not representing the good people of Scranton . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 beg to differ. I'm going to read the percent of victory for Joe Biden in all 22 wards that make up the City of Scranton . All 22 wards in the City were won by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.: First ward, 24.8 percent ; second ward, 22.2 percent ; third ward, 25 percent ; fourth ward, 13 percent ; fifth ward, 29.8 percent ; sixth ward, 21 percent ; seventh ward, 27 percent which take in downtown Scranton ; ninth which also takes in the downtown 17.4 percent ; tenth ward also downtown , 28 percent ; eleventh ward, 33.7 percent ; twelfth ward, 32.4 percent ; thirteenth ward, 24.5 percent ; fourteenth ward, 23.5 percent ; fifteenth ward, 24.6 percent ; sixteenth ward also downtown 42.7 percent margin of victory; 17th ward also downtown , 34 percent ; nineteenth ward, 23 percent ; twentieth ward, 21.4 percent ; twenty-first ward, 20 percent ; twenty-second ward 27.2 percent ; twenty-third ward, 31 percent ; and twenty-fourth ward, 31.6 percent . In all five downtown wards, Joe Biden won by 28.9 percentage points on average . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Now, if you're still thinking that Council and Council President Bill Gaughan are not representing the people of Scranton , you are diluting yourselves. When the official street signs come and some Republicans refuse to do business on Biden Street, it will be for only one reason. And that reason will be Donald Trump himself . He has burrowed in some people's minds like a parasitic worm. He is an offense to everything that this great nation stands for. So when it appears at least editorial wise that the opposition of the renaming is greater than the support , exactly the opposite is true. I have great pride in the City. I want it to flourish . The renaming will be a great boom to downtown Scranton and especially Biden Street businesses . The proper signage on Interstate 81 will bring tourist directly into the heart of Scranton . The editorials change daily as the writers tune into Fox news and worse and get their new arguments for not changing the street name. I wish they would just level with the readers and say I love Donald Trump and I hate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 that he lost the election and absurdly if they still think that the election was rigged -- my silly nephew told me a quote from Ben Shapiro a conservative commentator recently . It went, "I don't know if I have enough hatred inside of me to be a Democrat ." I had to laugh. Donald Trump has made the Republican party the party of hatred and intolerance for everyone who doesn't agree with them. And again folks, 955 streets , roads, boulevards , highway s, expressways have been named after Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He was a great civil rights leader but he was never president . We have a president born and raised in Scranton , Pennsylvania . Let's do what's right in honoring our native son. By the way, all of the businesses , homes -- and homes on those 955 roadways managed to change their addresses and they actually survived . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Albert Young. MR. YOUNG: Albert Young, Scranton resident . I have no political agenda. I grew 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 up with Joe Biden. I'll say no more. We have had two very large rainstorms here in Scranton in the last two and a half weeks. Both caused major flooding at our residence . The fire company was called and both times responded . As you all know, there is a major blockage to properties down below us which the administration is well aware of. This has never been cleared as yet. But do not forget the City still owns this culvert . The last storm, an orange construction barrel joined the forever blockage. The City placed in our backyard a manhole inspection unit which when the temporary repair was installed over two years ago and they have never -- and I repeat, never used the inspection hole. The City should now do at this time use this to clean this culvert out. I'm sick and tired of water. A week tonight Larry West, Attorney O'Brien and Lieutenant Joseph Hoban from the Fire Department showed up to inspect the area. And again all promised to do something . But so far it has been all but talk. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Everyone has avoided to give any response or show any further concern . Again, no one cares. I will say this though, thank God we have a fire company . They responded and gave assistance . Now, buyout on the question in the future, I hope they think hard and fast about compensation . And as far as this idea that everybody is trying to do something to get this idea cleared up, it would be in my estimation , it would be the best interest of everyone sitting at this dais to approach our Mayor all at one time -- not one at a time, five of you and go after the Mayor and our law department to get this thing fixed now. Twice in 10 days is enough. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Last session before Council , I spoke of rebuke to this Council because of its behavior . And I wanted to touch back on it once again. People come before this Council to voice an opinion . And they have a right to voice their opinion . That actually is what this Fourth Order is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 about. There were comments put in some paperwork about color of office. And there is a truth to that. And what I want to address on that part is when a member of a community comes here to comment before Council and is argumentative , abusive , angry, that it's part of the office to rise above that and not have to respond to it. Having Council get into a grade school fight back and forth between the dais and the speaker 's floor is not in the best interest of the -- of this body. And I would ask that before Council actually does that again that they consider just not saying anything and not taking to heart the abusive words that are uncalled for in this body because it does not represent bad upon Council itself if they stand back. It represents bad upon the speaker who is being abusive . To move on from that, one of the participa nts here have said that maybe people should be more interested in looking at the budget. And I took a moment to take a look at that and noticed budget line 300. The previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 year balance is listed as zero. When this body has actually called to claim that there were funds available from the prior year I believe 4 million dollars but that were put away in some fund but they're still not reflected on that document as being in existence . Why is there a line zero when it has come to -- it has come forward that there was a budget surplus from the previous year. Why is that being concealed ? I'm concerned about professional services receiving a $215,000 transfer . Part of the reason of this is not only budgeting issues that should have been taken care of by budget, but that service was now funded by raiding the workmen 's compensation operating fund. Why are we raiding workmen 's compensation to fund the City's operation ? We've had a problem before with workmen 's comp insurances all being underfunded and raiding them to supply another department is a serious concern . I have a question about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 subcontractors we've hired for the City. Do City subcontractors actually have assigned workers to them? And if so, are they paying the city wage tax as well? After all, they're employees of the City as subcontractors . Are we getting the wage tax that the City requires from everyone else? About a year -- about two years ago at this point, I pushed forward for a press parking spot and for a change in parking meters in the City if you could address that in Fifth Order. I know it has been pushed forward to public safety prior, but I've heard nothing in months. And last of all, in this budget, some of the wording is a little bit disturbing . And what I find disturb ing is whoever in the police department decided to name different organizations , the Scranton Police Department Community Surveillance Wireless Network . Are we in George Orwell when we surveil our community as part of operation ? Most places call it public safety, not surveillance of their citizens . And I was also surprised we have a Civil Disturbance Unit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 because we haven't had a lot of civil disturbance . As a matter of fact, their equipment is so old that it has dissolved over 15 years and needs to be redone. I'm not really sure how much of Civil Disturbance Unit we need separately in Scranton rather than just operating between public and police. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for tonight . Would anyone in the audience like to address Council ? Frank -- oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Dave. MR. DOBRZYN : Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I'll have to read over some of the budget items up and coming. But we really do need to settle this IT Department thing. Really needs -- you can't get somebody for $65,000 a year with a top notch degree, any ability and experience . Once again, you know, my comment at the last one was about the uptick in Delta. And I'm going to declare myself a profit and feel free to send me some money. I mean, you know, here we are back in masks. People are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 refusing vaccination s and refusing to wear masks and my time is ticking away. This is the second year now that's being interfered with totally . I sat around realizing that life isn't infinite. It would be nice to be able to attend some concerts . I was down the Italian Festival . But I practically had to drag my wife down. She didn't even seem to want to go until she got there finally . But people are sitting in emergency centers with gunshot wounds waiting , waiting . Now, down south -- this is going on down south. Another person was turned away from six hospital s in Texas. So I'm very glad that we're -- we seem to be a little more community minded up here. But it's a real shame that this is still going on. And if you haven't gotten vaccinated in this area or wherever you see this on YouTube throughout the country , go ahead and get it. I had a good friend that got gravely ill during June. And he called me up and had me show up. And he's a faith healer depending on (inaudible ) you know, and I don't even know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 how I feel about the guy now because I was a little shy on bread but that could be my condition two or three days later. And fortunately , I didn't require testing I just kind of laid low. But it's just unGodly how bad this has gotten. And once again in the vote -- on the voting Texas just passed their law. And we have plenty of people in Pennsylvania with the same ideas. It was taken off of Mr. Mastriano and the name just dropped out of my head -- the majority leader in Pennsylvania Senate. And it just goes on and on and on. So anything anybody can do, call your Congress man, keep barraging them because somebody has to be convinced to straighten that out. Otherwise , in some states they cancelled the poll -- closed the poll because they were not disability accessible . Now, I always thought that if you are so disabled that you can't get up the steps, you could file for an absentee ballot. And that's what they were all about. Well, they just closed the polls. So people were waiting in line for hours upon 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 hours upon hours. We're safe for right now with Tom Wolf at the head. But, you know, that could be all up for grabs next year. And it's very serious . Nobody has six hours to wait in line to vote. And as the community leaders , anything you can do would be greatly appreciated . And some day the vote you save may be your own because you're all busy too. You know, like, we have to close Council every time we have a voting day. It's on Tuesday . Thank you. Have a good evening . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. You too. Would anyone else from the audience like to address Council tonight ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , resident and taxpayer . I would like to start tonight by thanking Engine 10 firefighter s and DPW workers and utility workers and all who came to the rescue of my East Mountain neighbors who were victims of the City's failure to deal with stormwater . It is so sad. Now, on the 29th of June you had HRG here. They gave you a report that was -- but they also said in that meeting that it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 complete . Now, I would ask that is over two months since that. Where is the HRG report? When is this City going to get off their duff and stop doing studies and feasibility studies and doing a lot of talk and not fixing anything ? East Mountain is terrible . It's probably one of the oldest sections in this City. And it does not have an adequate drain system. And something needs to happen. Has anybody seen the report? MR. GAUGHAN : They presented the report. The final report was suppose d to come I think in a PDF or a binded copy. But we have not received it yet. MS. SCHUMACHER : Sad. Also, speaking of reports , what about the park study? Has anyone seen the report from the park study? That wasn't in item three. MR. GAUGHAN : No, because the park study is still going on. I talked to Tom McLane the other day. That's still ongoing . But they are getting close to completion . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. That would be nice too. On the park -- on the capital 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 budget, I do have issues with it. But I will hold those for the hearing that will have to occur before I guess the first of December . I'm looking forward to your response to Joan on the audit for 2020. And I would like to ask Dr. Rothchild , she has said in the past that she is in favor of the Home Rule Charter . And it's been 20 years and I think we could do some -- with the technology that's available now, I think we could do a good job. So I would like to ask the Doctor to make that into a motion not necessarily tonight ; but I would like to see how you're -- I would like it to pass. But I would like to see if we have as many yes people on that as we do on some of the other things that come here and get rubber stamped . And then the tax policy, I'm a little confused on that because I went through my file -- I did some filing over the weekend . And one of the things that was there was the newspaper article when the Mayor announced that tax policy group. And the last paragraph says it would be open to the public. And if there were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 any -- well, it gave the dates -- the days of the week and the month that they would hold hearings and that it would be open to the public and if there were ever any changes it would be properly -- people would be properly advised which I guess is the legal notices. And I read them rather religiously . And I don't know why there's been an issue. But I do hope that there is something in the 2022 budget from that committee . Mr. Donahue , I believe you took Mr. Gaughan 's spot on that. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : And is it winding up? MR. DONAHUE : So we're into the phase two now. The first phase is more of a data gathering . MS. SCHUMACHER : I'm sorry, I didn't get that. MR. DONAHUE : I'm sorry. So we're more doing phase two now. Phase one was more of a data gathering phase. We've had some scheduling issues over the summer. But there is one tomorrow night at 5:00. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 I know you joined ones in the past. I don't know if the Mayor sent you login -- the Mayor's office sent you login information or how that works. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And when is the final report due out then? Phase two -- MR. DONAHUE : Hopefully by the end of this year. We're -- MS. SCHUMACHER : But not in time for the 2022 budget. MR. DONAHUE : No, there's not many action items we could take in terms of the 2022 budget except for the conversion from BPM to payroll prep. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I've run out of time. So I'll bring the rest back next week. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Would anyone else like to address Council tonight ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster , any motions or comment s tonight ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I have a couple comments here. One, Mr. Gaughan , we got correspondence from Kohanski and Company . We spoke a little bit about it in caucus tonight . They provided an update to City Council on the status of the December 31st, 2020 financial audit. We received the general fund trial balance on August 9th, 2021. And most of the other information that they requested has been provided by City staff members and the contract accountant . They started some of the preliminary audit work and expect to begin the detail testing next week and will continue to provide updates. And I think tonight in caucus Mr. Donahue and Mr. Gaughan stated a date in September that we're expecting that. Yeah, we're expecting that in midSeptember . MR. GAUGHAN : Correct . MS. SCHUSTER : All right. And then, Mr. Voldenberg , I -- over the break me and you discussed several properties . One was 1434-1436 Dorothy Street with some quality of life issues. And the other one was 738 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Prescott Avenue, also quality of life issues. If we could send correspondence to get some updates , I know they said some violations have gone out. But we haven't had any updates in some time on those. Also, we receive d emergency certification for tree removal . And I got a request going back I'd say at least a month for the 400 block of Tenth Avenue in West Scranton there were some trees that were marked with some orange spray paint. But there hasn't been any movement on those yet. So if we could also send correspondence about tree removal for the 400 block of Tenth Avenue. So this morning or earlier this afternoon I did send an e-mail that I receive d from a Keyser Valley resident . It was about drain basin cleaning . And it was a machine that they use. Her and her mother had been out on their property where a drainage basin was being cleaned. And the e-mail was expressing her gratitude for DPW as well as the efficiency of this machine cleaning basins. In the Keyser Valley area I have noticed that there has been some effort to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 these drains cleaned. I've noticed it on my own block. And we also received an e-mail yesterday regarding the same thing. Although we're seeing some movement, the issue still remain in these areas. So I think we need to keep pressure on and continue with the maintenance of these drains. As well I did get to see Mr. Young's property prior to the storm the other day. And the setup that he had with two sump pumps and sand bags and tarps and things like that to keep the water out of the house is unacceptable . I know that City Solicitor as well as Mr. West were down at the property and they did inspect the garage that's two doors down. Mr. Hayes, could we look into any barriers there may be for the DPW? I know the DPW does have the equipment to do demolitions . If there is any barrier s for possibly DPW to help in removing this garage and blockages there. And also while on break, I did receive a call from Unico. And in 2015, Council passed a resolution to honorarily name Luke Avenue after our sister city in Italy. And I did reach out to President 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Gaughan on this as well as DPW Director Tom Preambo . The person that reached out to me did have the funding for the honorary signs to be put up as well as for the labor. So they should have the funds to do that. And Mr. Preambo stated that if those funds were available, they would be able to do that in the near future. That is all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I got a couple. So I'm going to start with Mr. Coyne's first inquiry about press parking . Mr. Voldenberg , I do remember you sending the correspondence . I remember us getting something back that they were going to look at it. Can you followup with that and see what the status of that is? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And then this precedes you, Mr. Voldenberg . But this was back -- God, it had to be back in September . I brought forth a concern on 1149 Sloan Street. The rear of it is a big garage. It was an illegal garage that was operating there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 The police did some ticketing of some cars that were parked illegally . But the owner of this home was given 30 days to prove that, you know, it wasn't illegal . But it was illegal . And then they finally left. But my understanding is they're back. So -- and that is since last October this has been going on. But I do remember the enforcement documents . They will be fined $500 a day if they operate . So that should still pertain to this same group because the same group is back. So could you please follow up on that address ? And this is prior to you. If you need some of the e-mails and you can't find them I have them all. They can probably help you. And lastly, in caucus we were talking about NRS. I think everybody knows who NRS is. Before recess, way before recess, you know, we were told by the administration that all ties were severed that, you know, there was a little bit of divorce they were trying to have. And, of course, they wanted to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 buyout. I know I was totally not in favor of that. But we haven't heard anything since. I would like to know, Mr. Voldenberg , if you would please contract the administration , ask where we are with NRS. Did we pay them off and not know about it? Are we still negotiating with them? Or is the legal department negotiating with, you know, releasing ourselves from them. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a few. First, I wanted to ask Mr. Voldenberg if you would be able to reach out to zoning on Harrison Avenue, we had the discussion before about the illegally parked vehicles that are parking on the sidewalks and on front lawns. That's still occurring . And I know that when we had walked along with LIPS there wasn't really anything that they could do about it. They referred us to zoning so if we can contact them. And I had mentioned in caucus but I just wanted to say that over the month of August since we weren't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 meeting , decided to take that time that I had to meet with various departments within our City. And I found it really useful and beneficial to speak with our department heads. I'm excited that we'll also be having them in for caucuses in upcoming weeks. So the people I met with included our new public health coordinator Dr. Saxena. I went down to DPW and got to visit there. It's been a little bit of time that I've been down there. So it was nice to see some changes that they've made. I spoke with the BA's office and as well as OECD. And I'm planning on having monthly meeting s with Director Cipriani to stay up-to-date on everything happening with OECD which falls under my committee . So that's everything that I wanted to say. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just briefly to answer some of Miss Hodowanitz 's questions . Frank, can we reach out to IT again and make sure that they put the basic agreement s of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 CBAs on the website , not the amendments to the agreement but the whole agreement so that that's available to the public because I agree that needs to be on there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. DONAHUE : In terms of does the City have the money for the MMO, you know, everything I understand we will have the money to pay off the MMO towards the end of the year. And then on the Plotkin Shoe Store, what was in Third Order tonight was correspondence we got. I believe we'll be getting legislation down next week for it to come before us. I believe from what I've found out so far is that the Board agrees that it needs to be torn down. But it's -- the plan was missing details as to how they were going to do that and then still safely protect the infrastructure on the inside. So but that will be in front of us next -- you know, we get the legislation next week. And we'll have a hearing and move on from there with that process . Over the weekend I got a call about tires behind a house at 1602 South Webster Avenue. It's next to a repair 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 shop on Palm Street that we've had a lot of issues with in the past. And the amount of tires they have in this yard is concerning . So I know that licensing and inspection s is aware of it and also the state DEP as well as the State Health Department because this is actually one of -- about a block away from one of the first cases of West Nile was discovered within South Scranton . So would we be able to get an update too on that from -- to ask for constant updates from the Licensing and Inspections Department in terms of how that's progressing , Frank? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I'd to like make a motion to send a letter to Mayor Cognetti regarding a full and complete update on the Meadow Brook Creek Project and what steps can be taken to mitigate the flooding -- the flooding of Wyoming Avenue residents in the near term. MR. DONAHUE : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , this is an issue that obviously has been going on far longer than I've been here. It's been going on for decades and decades and decades . When I first got on Council and this thing came in front of me, I was in Al Young's house, sat across the table from him and his wife on multiple occasions . I have been in contact with Mr. McCrone . I was on the phone with him this morning . Al Young called me last night at 9:30. I called him back -- I was asleep. I called him back at 7 a.m. this morning . This is unacceptable . We all know that. There is a Meadow Brook Creek Project that is in the works. I have asked and asked and asked and asked repeatedly for a meeting , a public caucus so that these poor people can find out where we are with this project . Where we are, that's all -- an update. And I keep being told, it's going to be schedule d. We'll let you know. We'll let you know a date. I want this letter sent. I want a date within the next two weeks. We are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 not confined to Tuesday s. I don't care when it is Friday, Saturday , Sunday, Monday, Wednesday , Thursday , Friday. It doesn't matter to me as long as it is a public meeting televised on ECTV and all the neighbor s could be present . That's all I care about. I spoke with a gentleman today, lost another furnace . And it's not just Wyoming Avenue. There are other parts of the City that are in the same position , thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars . And I'm not an engineer . I have been down there multiple times. I think we know one of the things that can be done to at least mitigate the issue in the near term. This project is going to take a decent amount of time. There is a lot of layers to this. We had Mr. O'Brien, the City Solicitor in here about eminent domain and all those other things. But in the near term, government is suppose d to help people. I cannot stand any longer people coming to me saying, Mr. Gaughan , I lost another furnace . I had to spend another 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 $10,000, 20,000, 30,000. Money doesn't grow on trees. Thank God I don't get flooding in my house. I live in North Scranton . If I did, I would be doing the same thing Mr. Young, Mr. McCrone and the others down there are doing. But it's falling on deaf ears. There are things being done. But why don't they just come out and explain it to these people? This is how we got in this position in the first place with Mr. Young -- miscommunication , too many lawyers involve d in everything that we do here in the City. So again, I want a meeting within the next two weeks in these chambers with the residents to explain the project and where we are with the project . It's not rocket science and it's not hard. And I would like the Mayor there, the City Solicitor , the engineering company , the DPW Director , I want all of them here. Let's lay the cards on the table and find out where we are. Why can't we get that garage down? Why can't we at least fix the problem in the near term? Put the cards on the table. Put it to rest once and for all. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 notion that we don't care, that is not true. And I think the people on Wyoming Avenue can tell you that. I may not talk about it up here every week, but I have been on the phone. I have been trying to push this issue for the last eight years, the last eight years. And it is ridiculous that we have to continue to talk about it instead of just doing it. And it's not just there. It's in other parts of the City too. Now, to the DPW's credit, I think progress has been made up in Keyser Valley although we're not where we should be. They're trying. But in this particular case, we need to lay the cards on the table. Let's get them in a room in a public caucus and put this issue to bed. Trying to schedule something for weeks and weeks and weeks, it just doesn't fly with me. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : I would just want to just agree with President Gaughan real quick and just add on too that that garage was condemned more than two years ago. And it had a hole in the floor of it more than two years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 ago. So the fact that it hasn't been torn down and dealt with, that is a problem . And I agree we need to get this settled as soon as possible . MR. SCHUSTER : So on the question , I would just like to add a friendly amendment . If we can get the barriers to what it is to tear this garage down, the DPW can do the demo on this. If there is any legal barriers , let us know. If not, let's move ahead with that. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Another issue that came up that I would like further explanation on, it was brought to my attention . I did speak and confirm with the Mayor that this did occur or is occurring with the opening of Novembrino Splash Pad.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 We have lifeguards there. And it's my understanding that when there is not a lifeguard there, there is at times a fireman there that could potentially be getting paid overtime . So the Mayor did confirm with me that that has occurred . I would like to know how much overtime has been paid for a fireman to be at Novembrino Park. I'm sorry, I don't agree with that. I mean, I think we have to protect our assets. And if you want to have lifeguards up there that's fine. But when there is no lifeguard, to pay someone to sit where there is no standing water, that doesn't make sense to me. So please followup on that, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. GAUGHAN : Also, one of the things that I've been pushing for for a long time and to the Mayor's credit and the administration 's credit, we're finally going to get to a point where we do have the department heads come into Council and have a conversation and a presentation about what has gone on in these department s for the last year and then answer questions from Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 I've said this for years since I've been blue in the face. If you look at what county does and the school district does, they have their department directors come to the meetings, answer question s when there is legislation on the agenda -- on their agenda. They come and they talk about it. Now, as I said in the caucus tonight , I am not suggest ing that department heads come here every week. I think that is probably overkill. But my vision of this for the past few years was at least once a quarter . So I did speak to the Mayor. She thinks it's a good idea. I think it's good Government . So we are in the process of getting those department director s to come into Council as we enter the discussions on the 2022 budget. So I do appreciate that. Mr. Voldenberg , the 1800 block of Ferdinand Street, a gentleman stopped me after church last Sunday. We've faced this problem before, water runoff. The neighbor s there when we have cold weather , they literally would miss days of work because the whole block turns to a sheet of ice. So they would like a meeting with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 DPW Director prior to the start of winter to see what measure s can be taken so these people don't run into this issue again. I know that -- I think there was a meeting up there. They were up there at one point. But the neighbor s are worried again that this is going to happen. So if you could try to coordinate that and schedule it, I would appreciate it. The other thing that we're stilling waiting on is the mystical Serrenti Center. It's something that we've asked for now a long time. I again was told by the Business Administrator that we would get something on this. So when we do, we'll present it to the public. But we spent a significant amount of grant money there. And we -- Council I think asked in the past just for a general update how much money has been spent, what that money has been spent on and where that project is going. So I would appreciate that. 2939 Birney Avenue in Minooka , absolute disgrace . The City tore the house down which was fantastic . But the lot is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 overgrown, looks terrible . Neighbors have reached out to me now on several occasion s. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can you please get the DPW or someone to get out there and cut the grass? I don't know off the top of my head if that's in the land bank. But it's on the main street going through Minooka , makes the whole neighborhood look awful. We requested on several occasions about the overtime in the City. We did receive a response from Mr. West which I appreciate , receive d it late this afternoon so I haven't had a chance to go through it. This will be in Third Order next week. The City Controller , John Murray identified several concern s about overtime numbers being way over budget. This does address I think at least some of those concerns . So we'll put that in Third Order for next week. I also would like an update on the Nay Aug Pool. Councilman Donahue and I have met with the Mayor on this. The Mayor knows where I stand on it. I continue to be concerned . Every time I walk around Nay Aug Park and see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 standing water in that pool and the condition of the pool, it's really disheartening . As I stated here in the past, Nay Aug Park I think is one of the jewels of the City. We need to keep it that way. There's been talk about potentially doing this, the pool project in phases. I do not agree with that. I think that would take a number of years. This is going to be a multimillion dollar project . I think it's an investment . I think we have to go for financing on this project . And I think we should do that as soon as possible . So Councilman Donahue and I have met with the Mayor. And I've given the Mayor my take on this whole thing. But we don't yet have a plan of attack. So I think the sooner we get that the better. DR. ROTHCHILD : President Gaughan , I met with the Mayor on this as well just to make you aware. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, okay, thank you. Since we're coming up on 2022 budget, I'd also like, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could reach out to the administration to give Council an update on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 all of the new position s that were included in the 2021 budget. Give us an update on what these positions have brought to the table in terms of efficiency , revenue or improvement in operations within the specific departments . There were a few position s that were included . So I'd like to know what exactly has been done, what impact those positions , if any, has had on City operations . I would also like to know in terms of City Hall employees now that obviously we're facing once again the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic how many City Hall employees are working physically working in the building and how many are working from home, what is our work from home operation s look like now in the City of Scranton . And I think that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MS. SCHUSTER : President Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : One more thing, can we have Mr. Voldenberg forward Miss Hodowanitz and Mr. Coyne's question s to the administration ? I think they were pretty 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 succinct in what they were asking. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR.

MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , Solicitor Hayes, can you just speak to this similar to how you did in the caucus tonight ? ATTY. HAYES: Sure. It's essentially an ordinance which codifies a fee schedule for all the various tasks that would be performed through the collection of municipal claims including delinquent refuse fees. This fee schedule is identical to the fee schedule which was attached to the contract with the -- the City entered with Portnoff Law Associates in the spring. So this is a -- this is in practice , this fee schedule is already being imposed. This is just a memorialization and codification of that fee schedule . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? This legislation simply allows the City of Scranton to coordinate and work with other law enforcement agencies throughout the county to reduce the -- unfortunately the illegal drug supply. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 The police department and others according to the legislation have been very frustrated by some of the limitations due to the jurisdictional issues, manpower , equipment shortages and inadequate financial resources in attempting to stem the illegal narcotic s and drug trafficking . So I think this is actually a unique arrange ment that will help to stem that. So I will be voting in favor. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE CITY OF SCRANTON APPLICATION FOR GRANT FUNDS FROM THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE ASSISTANCE FISCAL YEAR 2021 EDWARD BYRNE MEMORIAL JUSTICE ASSISTANCE GRANT IN THE AMOUNT OF $81,264.00 FOR EQUIPMENT TO BE USED BY THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 CIVIL DISTURBANCE UNIT OF THE SCRANTON POLICE FORCE AND AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO ACCEPT THE GRANT, COORDINATE AND DISBURSE THE GRANT FUNDS AS APPROPRIATE . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-G be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , with regards to this legislation , there wasn't really any details included . There was I think a copy of an application but there aren't like PDF attachments as it -- as it includes in this like photocopy version . So I'd like to know what the equipment is that they're seeking and have a little bit more of an understanding as to the necessity of that equipment . MR. GAUGHAN : On the question , I think it did mention in there that the equipment includes helmets with face shields , chest protecters , shin guards, four arm guards, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 gloves and protective masks with filters. The current equipment is over 15 years old and certain equipment has become unusable . One of the -- I think Mr. Coyne mentioned tonight , you know, why do we have this if they haven't used the equipment in 15 years. I would disagree with that. I think the moment that we don't have this equipment and we do have a civil disturbance , that's when everybody 's going to be up in arms, where's the Civil Disturbance Unit? Why didn't you have the equipment ? I support this a thousand percent . Look at the pandemic , they didn't do away with the pandemic office in the federal government . But they said, we haven't had a pandemic in a 100 years, let's not defund it; but let's, you know, take some of the funding away. Let's not put as much effort into it. Well, then we're faced with a pandemic and everyone went, jeez, I wish we put some money into that. So I'm glad we haven't had to use this in 15 years. But boy oh boy, I want our police department to be ready, willing , and able which I know they are to have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 that equipment in case there is a civil disturbance . So we need to make sure that the men and women in the police department have everything that they need at their disposal should there be an unfortunate incident . So I'll be voting in favor. Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR.

On the question , I mention ed to Mr. Voldenberg in the caucus the proposal abstract here on page seven is cut off. So if you could -- you're going to double-check with them just to get a full copy of that so we can include it. The police department has been seeking accreditation status since 2005. Due to numerous factors including budget constraint s, they have not been able to get it. So I do appreciate them submitting this grant. I hope they get it. And I'll fully support this legislation .

It calls for new trees, rain gardens which will improve the water quality and reduce the temperature of the runoff which will in turn enhance the Lackawanna River Watershed, improve street lighting , new sidewalks . I always think -- I'm a big believer in if your main streets in your City are well taken care of, that will branch out into the neighborhoods . It's like a broken window's theory. So I always notice when I walk around whether it's in West Scranton , downtown , the first thing anyone notices is the sidewalks . Sidewalk s to me are so, so important . The street lighting is important . Anything that can enhance the safety of the neighborhood resident s especially in that corridor as you're entering West Scranton I think is really important . So I support this 100 percent . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR.

What a great addition to West Scranton . This is a great piece of legislation with the new piece of playground equipment there. And I was really pleased to see so many families that were there to enjoy the splash pad. And I do think and I know that I spoke to the Mayor about this and I know that she's on board with where we can when we can find the funding to put splash pads in the City. I have four young children . And they don't like anything better than going to a splash pad. I think it is great for our resident s, great for our children and especially in terms of maintenance , they are relatively -- not maintenance free by any means. But in terms of having a pool or a splash pad, the splash pads are definitely less -- there is less maintenance that has to be done there. Anyone else on the question ?
