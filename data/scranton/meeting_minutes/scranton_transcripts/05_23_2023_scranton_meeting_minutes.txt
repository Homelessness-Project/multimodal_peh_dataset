I'm not sure if any of you guys have driven up North Main Avenue in West Side lately. But I would like to commend NeighborWorks and the West Scranton plan with the parking lot project that they just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 finished . They did a fantastic job and I would like to congratulate them. That's all I have. Thanks. MR. KING: Is there anyone else that has any comments ? Fourth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , city resident . This first page that you're looking at is page 12 of a document that was in Third Order last week. It's the Controller 's Annual Financial Report for 2021 based on the 2021 audit. And you could see the item I've highlighted , the nonresident wage tax. They've dropped the word wage but that's what it is. It was budgeted for $100,000. And this says they collected nothing , okay. And this was pointed out to me last week by Tom. And it's like, hum, what would explain nothing being collected ? Well, I guess it could be a typo. Let's see, or maybe nobody in Northeastern Pennsylvania has to pay this tax. Well, I don't think that's true. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Or maybe since, you know, we have a history of some corruption in this city, especially during the Courtright era, so maybe it went into somebody 's pocket. Well, who knows. But I think the most likely explanation is the money if it came in and it probably did, was posted to the wrong account . So I said to myself, well, you know, but this report, you are one of the address ees just like you are on the audit and other documents . And I said the City Council should be a little bit upset about this and be asking questions . So I decided to spend my free time going back and seeing what did we collect in prior years. So if you look at the excel spreadsheet , I looked at all the operational budgets that were on the City's website back to 2004. You don't see this line item until 2011. And you could see the amount budgeted over the year ranged from $500,000 down to $100,000 last year. And this year it's up to $600,000. Then the budget would tell you how much was collected as of September 30th. And you could see the numbers . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Notice that there are six years there where it's a zero for September 30th. So I said, well, I'm going to do a right to know and ask what we collected through December for all of those years. And they didn't give me just one number. They gave me a computer printout with those last four columns . And I dare you to tell me what the true number is. But you could see there are a lot of zeros. And so I ran around talking to a lot of people, John Murray the Controller , Kathy Weschler at the Single Tax Office and finally Matt Domines ' up in the BA's Office. Matt was most helpful . And he said, yeah, he said I recognize that. And looking at the monthly Controller 's reports finally starting to see figures starting in March of 2023. But it still raises the basic question . You know when he get these documents I would ask you if you do nothing , just scan it, you know, just flip through the pages. And if you see a zero on the revenue side, that ought to be a one humdinger of a big red flag. And you should be asking what happened here to see that this has been going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 on for at least six years, okay? Boy, this city needs an internal auditor like you read about. And I also talked to Matt or he volunteered to me that they are going to add a 10 percent penalty clause to the new audit. Is that true? MR. KING: Yes. That's correct . MS. HODOWANITZ : Is that going to be put in writing or are you going to pass the contract the way it stands tonight ? MR. KING: No, that will be in writing . MS. HODOWANITZ : It will be writing . Okay, because it wasn't last week. He also told me that the next audit they will have a management discussion and analysis section for the audit because I think he's probably going to write it. I tell you right now that you are going to miss him when he is gone. Also, last week I wish you would explain from Third Order the payroll preparation tax figures for 2023 first quarter . And Item 5-E, this Stafford Meadow Brook Flood Mitigation Project . Please 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 translate the matching funds paragraph written by OECD. I am too stupid to understand it. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . I'd just like to start off by saying when we ask questions here, would you please speak up? We can't -- we can't hear you from the podium here. I know there's speakers , but we have a hard time. And, Mr. McAndrew , I want to apologize for the last time I was here. I didn't hear your response to my question about do you feel that the DPW should have records. Would you please tell me now what you were thinking ? MR. MCANDREW : Absolutely . And no problem . I didn't think you needed -- no apology needed. I do believe -- and we're working on some legislation for better tracking of all hours from every department . MS. FRANUS: Thank you. Mr. King, I asked two weeks ago about legislation . Do you consult your attorney and are you going to draw 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 up some legislation like Mr. McAndrew said? MR. KING: We are looking into it, yes. MS. FRANUS: It doesn't take long for legislation , right? MR. KING: I can't give you a timeline . But my answer is, we're looking into that. MS. FRANUS: And the legislation would include records and dates? That's what's most important . MR. KING: That's what we're planning to put in there. MS. FRANUS: Pardon me? MR. KING: I said that's what we're planning to put in there. MS. FRANUS: Okay. Let me ask you this just to set the record straight . I'm sure you probably don't even have to answer this but I'll throw it out there. If any one of you had your own business or work for a company that ran a business and people in your business work two weeks -- payroll every two weeks and for the two weeks they have 44 hours, 40 hours overtime but they don't have a date and they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 don't have a reason. Would you pay them? I don't think so. So that is the same thing that is going down in the DPW. There's no records because if you remember not so long ago in the paper last week, two weeks ago a police officer got fired because he claimed he worked overtime but he didn't. He got fired. And he's getting six months in jail. Nothing is proven yet, but I see the same pattern here working overtime without any verification whatsoever and just taking home the money all the time since Mr. Preambo left. They're just running the show down there. It has to stop. Mr. King, I asked you also, did you talk to the Mayor and even Council about sending the PUC challenge to the water rate hike from -- that Scranton and Dunmore are the only ones in Pennsylvania paying the rate increase because you're suppose d to be represent ing the residents . MR. KING: We sent a letter to the PUC. MS. FRANUS: Yes, I know that. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 it was a good letter. But you should be sending -- I asked you if would you send a challenge , a PUC challenge , a letter to the PUC challenging the fact that only Scranton and Dunmore are the only people paying this rate increase . That's more important than the letter. It's a challenge to the PUC for those hikes. You could get someplace with that. Would you consider -- I asked you this three weeks ago. Silence . MR. KING: I'll look into. MS. FRANUS: You said that last three weeks ago. MR. KING: No, last time you asked me if I would send a letter and I did send a letter and I read the letter in these -- MS. FRANUS: I know that. But if you listen to your tape maybe from three weeks ago, you would see I asked you -- the PUC challenge , you and the Mayor and Council . That's on the record. I asked you and you said you would think about it. Well, three weeks later and you don't even remember . Here's another thing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 that's going on. This is something I'll bring up next week. Are you aware of the fact that the property owner that I know that owns many properties in town contact ed the rental registration because he owed some past bills. Some people owe seven years past due rental registration . Well, Robin Selemba from the rental registration told this property owner, don't worry about it. You just have to pay from 2022 on. We're going to forgive you the rest. How about all the people that have been paying the rental registration for years? And this rental registration officer -- director is telling the property owners that they're not -- they're going to forgive them all that they owe and start paying from 2022. I would like you to check into that and get an answer for me by next week. I hope you remember that I'm asking you this because I think it's very important . That would be the same thing as the garbage fee. Why would anybody forgive the people that owe the fees for that? You wouldn't. So why would you do that with rental registration ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 I also want to know who gave her the authority to do this? That's also something I want to know because this should not be happening . The city is in desire need of money. Somebody brought up it last week about rental registration , all the University of Scranton apartments . Mr. McAndrew I believe said that's wonderful and that we should do that. Well, if you are so in need of money from rental registration , why are they forgiving all the money people owe for years and years and years from 2022 back? Please get the information for me next week. Thank you -- and the PUC challenge to challenge our rate hike for Scranton and Dunmore only. The people in Dunmore would like to know this too. You're -- Council is suppose d to be representing us. Please write a letter to the PUC and challenge that ruling. You could stop this if you tried. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Franus. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello, Council . I'm not mad at nobody tonight so you could rest. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 would like to show my appreciation for the concern -- the group that printed this and mailed it in the hopes that somebody would give voting some thought around here. Three out of four seems pretty good really for a -- they had an uphill battle if you ask me. I don't know about the fourth. I think all four should have been replaced. Somebody must have felt sorry for one of them. When you -- when you vote on -- for someone out of pity, the worst comes to the top. You get a Paige, a Fetterman, a Candice , a Bridgett down there whose husband watches MSNBC to inform her according to her. Then I come to Mr. Courtright . He's like a local hero people worship . I've been -- I've said something adverse about him and was reprimand ed by several people. You know, when the pandemic started , he's the man that gave the eight colleges 10 million dollars in tax money to pay their own bills and responsibilities . At the very same time Sister Adrian's group was at the high school giving meals at the -- I was told there was a mile 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 long line of cars waiting . This is -- this is a terrible thing for -- to be involved in politics at this time. And then right when -- if that wasn't enough, you know, here he comes and gives the Munley Law firm, his wife's law firm a PPP loan up to a million dollars . I don't know how much they got. But if that's not a show of favoritism , they couldn't have been too destitute and impoverished that they got a PPP loan. I talked to people who would have been overjoyed to have gotten a few thousand dollars at this time. You see those picture s of Mr. Munley, he sure doesn't look like he missed too many meals. This morning real quick, Rosie and me stopped at Gerrity 's on Main Avenue to get some of the $1.49 eggs. And a lady grabbed my arm in the parking lot. She said -- asked me if I saw that article last week in the paper where they gave a house to a mother and child in Dunmore . She said her son has been trying to get something like that for years and years and can't understand . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 He works all during the pandemic , has a family, has a savings, and doesn't get anywhere . And here they give a large house to a woman with one child. It doesn't make good sense. It sounds like -- it sounds like regular Lackawanna County goings on if you ask me. You know, the newspaper doesn't tell you about the woman if she works, if she has a job, if she has any savings . I could almost take it for granted she doesn't. They don't build up why she was given this house. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: All right. I'm sorry. MR. KING: That's all right. Lee Morgan. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I'd just like to say that I still remember the questions I asked about ECTV. But you'll be here next week and so will I. So I don't really see, you know, I'd like to say something else today. You know, I've been trying to set up a meeting with the Mayor in regards to ECTV. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 And I haven't been successful to this point. I don't know if the Mayor screens her calls that come to her or not. You know, it's trouble enough to have the city itself locked down where you can't come into the building , but to cherry-pick the calls coming into your office I think I have a problem with that. And you know people now are coming and saying that the Mayor is bringing people here who crossed our border into the city. You know, we have homeless camps all around the outside of this community everywhere . And we have just amazing poverty in this city. And you watch people vote and you wonder -- I think today's Democratic party is more akin to the communist party than the Democratic party when you look at it. And when people read what -- and understand exactly what's taking place and if people were to read the Durham report they'd find out what President Obama, Hillary Clinton , and now President Biden had to do with that whole fiasco. The American people have no say in their own country . We've reached a point where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 the government dictates what's wrong and what's right for us even what kind of car we're going drive and how we're going to live. So the American people are no longer free. But I'm not really thinking they want to be free to be honest with you. They just want somebody to take care of them. But when you look at our city through my eyes, we went from 103,000 people to 76,000. We've been following the wrong course of action for 60 years. We're tearing houses down in neighborhoods . There's blight ruling everywhere . We've got homeless encampments everywhere. We're passing out grant money that's being misspent . I looked at the zoning changes. They don't make a lot of sense to me, okay, I'm going to get a colored map and be a little more informed on that. But from what I could see on that and from what SAPA was suppose d to bring, I'm just wondering who is looking at a long-range plan for this city? Because if we've lost that kind of population based on this short period of time, this city is not going anywhere . And when look 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 at people in the public school system, it's atrocious what's happened in the public school system in my lifetime . We were really educated when I was a child. I'm not saying that to belittle anybody . I'm just being directly honest. They wanted us to be self learner s to be able to step in a forum to speak to be educate d, you know, to educate ourselves. And that's just not what we're doing anymore. And when you take a look at our country as a whole, you know, you have to ask yourself is this the Democratic plan for our country because you look at what happened to ECTV. I mean, I don't mind being locked out of the studio because that's going to change in the future even if the administration and the Mayor have to change it's going to change. I think the Mayor had a major part to play in that since she controls funding to ECTV. But, you know, I go to the residents and have to ask them how do they let this corruption exist all around them? Look at where the grant money has gone through throughout my whole lifetime .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Somebody can maybe explain it better to me on what happened to, you know, the Novembrino pool neglected by the city or the Penn Ridge pool neglect ed by the city. God help the Nay Aug pool project because it's so far off center it's ridiculous . I mean, I just think that the Council is waiting for the election to be over so the Mayor could put some kind of plan together and create that monstrosity . And it's not even planned correctly . That's a discussion for another day. But did anybody ever think about putting a trampoline up that that has air under it and blows it up and it's hallow like the pool underneath it and watch kids jump up and down on one of them in another community and you'll get a better idea about what I'm talking about. The whole government needs to change. And I think you should all look at yourself in the mirror and say to yourselves , are you the conduit for that change and can you change the way you see the world. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Last week Mr. King had made a comment about how much money Miss Cipriani brought forward in this community by her work and how critical her function was in bringing cash and revenue into this city, which only leads me to question that if someone is so valuable and so important in bringing in a large flow of money and is so extreme ly competent in their position , why would anyone want to switch them to another position ? Why would anyone want to take -- not only take them out of that but give them an incentive bonus by moving along funds that were part of an OECD benefit because it was the ARPA was being run by OECD. And they worked hand in hand. But it seems the money doesn't follow OECD. It doesn't follow the direction of the company managing it. It follows a single person's pocketbook. I have serious concerns because you know as well as I do, Business Administration is a nice job to have. But you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 do you know what happens at the end of a mayoral term, they're replaced. And when they get replaced, you will lose that asset to the city. By moving out of OECD -- and I understand you don't fully have control of where the person moves to. But you do have control of extra incentive s and to incentivize something that is not in the best interest of the city at whole is betraying your responsibility to the citizen s and the benefit of the city. As I said before as a -- if she wants to be a Business Administrator and wants to live in Luzerne County, Luzerne County has the position of a Business Administrator . And maybe she should work there. The waiver that was granted to her by this body was for the OECD position because she was skilled in that particular job. I do not believe that the position that she's currently in was advertised , was put out for bids, that there were qualified candidates that were actually polled and brought in to find out who was the best person. The best person obviously was the one in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 pocketbook that would support the agenda and has supported the agenda. And I think it's a terrible disservice to the entire citizens in this body to reward that. You have the capability of in this Seventh Order of taking away that extra money and putting it back to whoever is in charge of it in OECD. That's where it belongs . It belongs in the planning . It doesn't belong in the Mayor's office. It doesn't belong in DPW. It doesn't belong with a person who is out there consulting and asking for people to support us in Harrisburg . That's why I believe that should be stripped from that order. It should not be in there. You're incentivizing , harming the city. Now just to touch up on the rental tax, the rental fee, when I brought that forward I did say the University of Scranton . But we have many other colleges here that have student housing . We have other nonprofit s that have housing as well. It's 45 per unit per year. It's not going to break the bank. But we're looking at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 if you take a look across the board for all of the universities , all of the non-profits , all of the lovely little places that have rentals that are under those covering s, you are probably looking at anywhere from 250 to $400,000 a year that's in your hands. I think we need to look at grabbing that money because we don't have very many pockets to go into anymore. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. ARGENTA : Hello, Virgil Argenta , Scranton resident . A quick question , a portion of the Broadway Street bridge was closed by PennDOT during an inspection due to deteriorating beams. There was nine and a half Jersey barriers installed to close a portion of the bridge. The weight sign is posted at 32 ton. Each Jersey barrier is one ton, which equals 2,000 pounds. 9.5 barriers would be 19 ton. Does this affect the integrity of the bridge? And should the 19 ton of barriers change the bridge weight? If so, the bridge weight would be limited to 13 ton.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 A triaxial load is between 30 and 36 ton. And I'm just curious is the 36 ton sign that's on the bridge, is it correct or should the Jersey barriers be taken into effect? And one other issue, the weather is getting hot. Are we going to make any provision s for homeless camps that seem to be growing around the city to get them out of the heat as we do in the cold? We put them into Weston Field. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. WATKINS : Hi, my name is Jack Watkins . I live at 1746 Bundy Street in North Scranton . I got a project going up there with the North Scranton Little League putting a park in. And Joe Alcowski {phonetic } runs it and they're doing it all wrong. There's no inspectors up there or nothing . His kids don't go there. He should have nothing to do with the field or nothing . And enough's enough up there. I've been waiting 10 years for this park to be built. I've been calling the inspectors every day and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 nothing 's getting done up there. I had the Mayor sit in my garage for an hour in my garage. After the second permit failed, he didn't pay for it. We'll take care of it. She never did so. She lied to me. She lives in Tripp Park over by me. She lives in Clarks Summit. She hasn't been in that house in three months. Why is she a Mayor in this town? That's what I want to know. Why is she a Mayor in this town and she hasn't been in that house in three months? That's what I want to know. And they're up there building the park now. They got it all -- and there's no inspectors up there. They're not putting -- running chalk lines, nothing , no schematics , nothing . Enough's enough. Ten years I've been waiting for this. I'm not going to be on this earth long. I got cancer. And that's it. And I'm going to be gone. I want my grandkids to see this. And that's it. That's all I got to say. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Watkins . We'll look into that. Frank, can we contact somebody that's involved with that project ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Watkins . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. DAY: Good evening , Tyler Day, Scranton resident . I also want to talk about the Business Administrator position . I'm worried about that the BA position and the ARPA position are being combined . We've had some real issues with the Business Administrator position in this administration . And I'm firm believer in the saying if you try to do everything , you'll just end up doing everything badly. And I'm also not happy about the residency requirement . I understand to bring qualified people in at a lower salary sometimes that's necessary . I do not think 120 K or whatever the salary is going to be is a low salary by any means and there's plenty of great places to live in the city. I don't think that one set of people should have a certain set of rules and everyone else should be living and working under a completely separate set of rules. It's not fair to all the other city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 employees that have done everything that they are supposed to are living in the city because that is a condition of their employment . So as it stands now, I would encourage Council to vote no. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Day. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn . Come to my attention people are curious about the mask. Well, I am gifted with four comorbidities. So I don't even need a cold let alone the big C word. All right. Once again I'd like to bring up this editorial about big mergers in hospitals . And I still have the article with me that they were bought out by Kaiser. And I will point out that my doctor got the shaft working on patients from the west coast attending a local school here. And certainly I hope the promises that they won't do that in the future, but it seems like everybody wants that little extra with the advantage plans getting it down on the plantation there. So it's something we better keep in mind. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 And the word keeps coming up what is socialism. Well, here's my opinion , public schools and working for public schools , teachers , janitors , administrators , etc., school nurses, veterans . Now, they -- in the beginning of the last century , they took care of your war wounds. But we're overloaded with veterans ' concerns because they are actually getting geriatric cases in back after the second Iraq war and it was overloading the system. And they didn't have enough -- if you were in the Army or service for a while and served in Iraq and Afghanistan multiple tours, your chance of being hurt or killed, wounded or injured went up exponentially . So they were overloaded. Okay, let's move on. Public transportation is subsidized . It's not very good here locally anyway. After 6:00 I hope you know how to walk. Social Security , pays out way move than what they ever take in. And, you know, in retrospect I don't know how they are going to find a job for someone that is 75 years old anyway. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Medicare , indigent care, medicaid , welfare , food and money for indigents ; and by the way, roads and bridges are built by the government and then people eventually start driving there. Public parks, police and fire, if your house is on fire the fire company don't stop at your front door and ask if you paid your taxes last year, you know, or how much taxes do you pay and that's how much effort we're going to put into saving your house or putting the fire out or even worse yet, having it catch two or three other houses on fire. If you're getting assaulted in the middle of the street, the policeman doesn't walk up and ask, sir, did you pay your taxes last year or are you on one of those welchers that don't pay anything ? I mean, it doesn't matter if the person is from California or Colorado or wherever . If a person is getting assaulted they stop and try to put a stop to it as soon as they can; financial aid to student s and so forth with public college s and private and public housing . There's another socialist ic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 thing. But what would happen if we just said no more public housing ? Well, I heard two times tonight about homeless camps. And when we build a big tower that costs $100,000 a month, guess what, that could have built a lot of small houses. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Have a good night. MR. KING: You too. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . First, I would like to thank the DPW and the pressure that you put on them to get the garbage away from 843 Moosic Street. It does look much nicer coming down there. So thank you. And I have a couple questions on ongoing projects . How many rights of way do we need to obtain yet on the Meadow Brook 2 project before we have 100 percent ? MR. SCHUSTER : I would imagine it's between 40 and 50. And the last update we got they've only secured one. MS. SCHUMACHER : Are you going to do anything to light a fire under them? You can't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 do the project without those rights of way. Look at what's happening. We still have a sewer authority because of those rights of way. You just keep letting it go and that's what's going to happen. A lot money is going to go down the tubes and probably a lot of people will get stormwater . Okay. That's one thing. What about the payments in lieu of taxes for the property tax exempt nonprofit groups. Is there -- MR. KING: Frank, did -- Andrew Cutillo was suppose d to put a RFP for that. Can you check and see where we are with that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask him tomorrow . MS. SCHUMACHER : I'm sorry, who's doing it? MR. KING: It's Andrew Cutillo . He's the assistant city solicitor . And he's putting together an RFP for -- to get someone to come and do the HUP test. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And maybe I missed it, but I don't believe the request to finish the project last year on Mountain Lake 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Road from the end of the lake down to Derby Avenue is in the summer paving. MR. KING: I know I asked and inquired about that section to see if there is any way that could be done. I don't know if we ever got a response . I'm sure the list was probably already establish ed prior to that request . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to them tomorrow , Mr. King. MR. KING: If you would, it's probably only about, I don't know, 200 meters maybe -- 2-300 meters at the most. MS. SCHUMACHER : I would make a big difference I know that. And my car knows it too. And when do you think we will have something together ? Who put out the RFP on the pilot project . Didn't you just say -- MR. KING: Yeah, I just said Andrew Cutillo is putting together the RFP. And I'm trying to get an update as to when he's going to put that out. He should be close because the last time I had spoken to the Mayor it was almost ready to go out. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. It will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 cover all of them though, correct ? MR. KING: I believe it's going to go out at look at any of these non-profits , many of which were established 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago. Maybe they were considered non-profits . But what the HUP test will do is go out and evaluate to see whether it still continues to serve the original purpose or if not, you know, they'll have to start paying their taxes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. There was one other thing I thought . I was coming home from an errand today. And I came up along -- I guess it's Roaring Brook coming up to I guess it would be Cedar Avenue. And I don't think any of you were here. But probably a decade ago a woman I believe her name was Dempsey . I don't know. But she came in and had a big presentation about what the city could look like. And one of the things she had was some swimming from Cedar Avenue down to that little -- I guess it's a dam where the water goes over it. And since we don't have anything at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Nay Aug, is there any chance that we could take a look at that or maybe if it was somebody could find out if it was Dempsey and -- MR. KING: I think you're referring to right down near the Chamberlain building . MS. SCHUMACHER : Um hum, right across from there, yeah. MR. KING: She suggested that there could be swimming right where that waterfall occurs afterwards ? That may have sounded like a great idea, but I would be extremely concern ed about the liability of doing something like that and, you know, we could certainly try to find out who brought that suggestion to us. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Hello, Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton city taxpayer . On my way here this evening there was not a lot of parking on the street. So I parked a few blocks down way down on Penn Avenue and walked up because I enjoy doing. And on my way up here I noticed that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 there was a fair amount of people walking around. I know there's been a number of complaints about crosswalk s and walkability of the area and it all needs improvement. There's still a lot of people walking around. And every parking space on all the streets was filled which is pretty great I suppose for the traffic -- the foot traffic downtown . But one thing I notice is that not a single one of the massive , massive parking lots that we have in downtown was even close to being filled. Many of them had two or three cars despite the fact that the parking lots take up half a city block. Almost 50 percent of the downtown is dedicate d only to parking. And that's not considering the street parking . So I know this does involve private parking garages and such. But that means that about 50 percent of all the infrast ructure in the downtown is dedicate d to cars and not to people. Now a gentleman earlier this evening complained that no one seemed to have a long-term plan for the city. And I believe that's what I've been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 sharing with you guys for the past couple of months. MR. KING: Delmar, was that just prior to this meeting that you noticed that? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Yes. That was tonight on my way in. MR. KING: I think if you were to come down during the middle of the day when people are working , a number of those lots are filled. And I'm certainly not advocating for these surface lots. I'm just saying that you would find a different situation at noon or 2:00 than you would at 5:30, 6:00. MR. GUZIEWICZ : I have. I've done that extensively because , of course, in order to speak on the topic I want to make sure that I'm well-educated on the actual structure of the city. So I've gone around in the afternoon pretty much anywhere from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. And none of the parking lots are filled. And many of them are more occupied than they are now. And that has to do with the fact that street parking is free and these parking lots cost money but none of them are filled.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 And additionally , the fact that all of the parking spaces on the street are taken up indicate that people want to be here. But it also proves that the only way for people to get here is by car. The only really reliable way into the downtown is by car, especially in the evening when the only possible exit is a car. You can't take the bus after 6 p.m. You can't leave the downtown via bus, either walking or you're driving . And a lot of the sidewalks coming into the downtown are nonexistent or subpar at best. So people want to be here. People are willing to park here. People are willing to come to whatever the downtown has to offer. But 50 percent of the city is -- or 50 percent of the downtown is taken up with automotive parking that isn't used most of the time even if it is fully packed during the eight hour work day. That means two-thirds of the day it's not being used. It could be used on housing , on people, infrastructure , on businesses , on a grocery store that the downtown doesn't have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 And to facilitate this, of course, we need better public transit . We need a train to take people in and out of the downtown . The buses aren't cutting it. Buses would be fine with -- or if they were backed up by rail transit . Scranton to Wilkes-Barre has one single trackage that goes nonstop from the downtown of each city, goes right through downtown Pittston , entirely privatized , never used. And we have -- used to have plenty of street car tracks here in the city that could take people all over the place. I mean, it's the Electric City. You see it when you drive in, big murals. You could see little signs pointing out where it used to be. You see in old photograph s the trackage that has now been paved over to make room for cars, which is a self-defeating issue because you get rid of the street cars to have more cars and now we need to destroy human infrastructure in order to allow for those cars to have more space, thus decreas ing the quality of life and the availability or interest of people coming in.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Right now, people want to be here. It's very obvious . And people are content to walk around, to park and go wherever throughout the city even if parking isn't most convenient . Yeah, everyone wants to just be able to park in front of the restaurant and go in. But obviously , just from walking around during the evening or during the day, people are willing to park a few blocks away and walk up. But they still have to park because they can't -- a lot of them can't live here in the city because 50 percent of it is dedicated to their cars. And most of that is surface lot, one story parking , no houses. You have to drive here. We could have a train. And we could have more people coming and going in the city, safer, longer term. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Delmar. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council . I'm Rick Little. Two weeks ago I came here and asked if someone could tell me who owns 400 Adams Avenue, the Scranton Housing building . And I gave an e-mail address and I haven't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 heard from anybody . MR. KING: I believe it was answered by our solicitor . ATTY. GALLAGHER : The Housing Authority owns it. It was an arm of the government so technically the U.S. Government owns it. MR. LITTLE: The U.S. Government . ATTY. GALLAGHER : It's a federally funded -- MR. LITTLE: I know it's federally funded. ATTY. GALLAGHER : The assessment records show Scranton Housing Authority is the owner or U.S. Government . MR. LITTLE: So they own the building , the Scranton Housing Authority which is set up by the Board of Commissioners ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : (Inaudible .) MR. LITTLE: Scranton Housing Authority -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : (Inaudible .) MR. LITTLE: Yes, but they're not Scranton Housing Authority . ATTY. GALLAGHER : I don't know what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 you're asking me. MR. LITTLE: I'm trying to find out who's really -- who -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : The Housing Authority owns the building . They are part of the U.S. Government . The U.S. Government funds them. So technically , the U.S. Government owns the building . MR. LITTLE: I see. Yeah, that's -- so since they are HUD and they set housing policy for everything there and they are funded by the federal government , the federal government owns the physical buildings . ATTY. GALLAGHER : Correct , my understanding . MR. LITTLE: So I live in one of those building s and they made a special rule for me that I can't talk to them. I can't -- I have to send a letter to them by certified mail. Even the manager of my building , you know, at first go and Karl Lynott comes down and he goes -- because I was used to putting papers in and getting it stamped by, I guess, by this federal entity Scranton Housing Authority .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 It says Scranton Housing Authority . And then I get to court and they say, oh, we never got the letters and, you know, I've served court papers there and now they've hired another thing. And it's just the way the thing is working because I go to the manager of my building and I figured out how it works. It's like they don't talk to you. They're just there. And, you know, and there's a whole thing in the federal government under the CF 24 of all of the things that are supposed to happen before you get evicted . They hand you some complicated spreadsheet, you know, this is the amount of rent you owe even though I'm exhausting myself writing letters to them and they're taking them and -- but the manager there -- all three managers that I've known, they are just there to keep you away. And they go by just their first names, you know, this is Debby. This is Gina. This is, you know, Kathleen . And the reason they do that is because they got everybody in the county in their pocket, everybody . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 they're getting all of this federal money. And the amount they pay one security guard would pay four of you guys' salaries , you know. And I applied for the federal funding and through the ERAP myself. And then it turns out, oh, your landlord isn't accepting the money even though my landlord is bound by 24 CFR 966, the federal rules for a HUD landlord . This is -- seems to me to be a very bad HUD landlord because they don't even want to talk to me. And when I go to the manager 's office, oh, we can't talk to you without a lawyer. I can't afford a lawyer. I just got done with family court in New York State learning a little bit about the law. And this is like torture , you know, and it's not good for the homeless situation because if I get kicked out of there, I'm homeless . And there's no two ways about it. But I would like to get in writing , you know, exactly about who owns that building 400, you know, because -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : I just told you who owns it. MR. LITTLE: You told me, but can I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 go to the Globe building and find that out looking up real estate records ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : You could look in the Assessor 's office. MR. LITTLE: Who? ATTY. GALLAGHER : The Assessor 's office, Lackawanna County Assessment Office. MR. LITTLE: Okay. I'll try that. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. My first one is Friday morning I went to up the 600 block of Prospect Avenue. And there was a crane there loading it looked like rolls of roofing material up onto the building . I looked for a permit, naturally there was no permit. So I called the city, had code enforcement either put a stop work order on it or go find out what's going on. The reason I bring this up is it seems every Friday 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 about 4 p.m. until about every Sunday until about dusk, we have a lot of construction in the city without permits . A lot of the trucks have -- looks like yellow tags on them. Anyway, I would like to know if the city contract with code enforce ment I believe ends at the end of this year. So what I'm looking for is to see if we can put into their contract a staggered shift, say if they work nine to five, then I would look for somebody ten to six, eleven to seven just so we would have more coverage in the evening . And I'd also like to include Saturday and Sunday. But I'd like to work it in so that we were not paying overtime so that we could have somebody all weekend long as to not to call somebody out every time we see somebody doing something . So, Mr. Voldenberg , would you forward this to the administration and ask if this is possible ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Would you also ask if it is possible if the Scranton Police Department is out and we get a call about this, would they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 be able to stop and just ask for a permit; and if there is no permit to cease work. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question also. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Second one is, I spoke with Director Pietreface about the playground up at Hammonds Grove, the lower one that was -- the sliding board was destroyed on and there was a lot of broken wood and stuff up there. He said that they did go up and correct it. I did go up and they did correct it. All the broken slides are gone. All of the nails sticking out are gone. All of the safety hazards and concerns were correct ed. So I would like to thank Director Pietreface and the parks workers at Nay Aug for taking care of that. While I was speaking with the Director , I was also informed that every park in the city was putting up this week no smoking signs, dogs must be leashed signs and parks close at dusk signs. So every park should have those up by the end of the week so that we can begin enforcing them because I guess we're told 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 if it's not posted, we can't enforce it. So that -- and also at that area, we are going to have a cleanup there at that lower playground this week because it is safe to use again we're going to cut the overgrowth down, all of the weeds, the vines, and all of the stuff up there. That will be at Sunday morning at 9 a.m. We're also going to go over and clean and start the waterfall for this summer. Everybody is welcome . So I'll see all of you guys there. And then the last thing is the meeting for Scranton Walkability Study it looks like it's going to be June 21st at Lackawanna College with Jeff Speck. I'll give you further information on that when that comes in. And then I have one last thing. The commercial truck parking , Mr. Voldenberg , I sent you a copy of this. This is the ordinance for the police department . And I got this from the Law Department . So they can be cited. And there's a citation amount here. So if you could forward this to Chief Carroll . I would ask just for all the commercial vehicles and stuff maybe the first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 month issue warning tickets so that they realize we're going to start citing them. This is for all the commercial vehicles in the residential neighborhoods . It also gives in detail what you can park and what you cannot. Naturally , construction vehicle s that are working in the neighborhood are exempt. Ambulances , fire trucks, any piece of city equipment is exempt. But the rest of this is all in the ordinance and also parking on the sidewalks . MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, sir. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. MR. KING: Got it. Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a couple things. Frank, I have two -- one address is a newer address . It's the rear of 1111 Blair Ave. There was a fire there in the past if we could just get an update on this property , see if it's on the demo list or what the city plans on doing with the rear of 1111 Blair Ave. I also got a call before the meeting about 305 and 307 Putnam. I know they've been given this address . But the neighbor s said 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 that there has been no movement so far if we could just stay on top of that, 305 and 307 Putnam. 718 Taylor Avenue, we did get a response from Don King saying that the -- that cleaning and wallpaper removal was all that was done at this point in time that the people that own the property are going to be applying for the permits before they do any additional work. There is some photos from the inspection that they did. The city is going to watch to make sure that they get the proper permits for any additional work. But at this point in time, the property owner didn't have any definite plans. It was explain ed that it was single family zoning and they wouldn't be permitted for a room or boarding house, just to report that out. But the city was out there on that. I did reach out to Solicitor Gallagher about overtime legislation . So if everyone here is in agreement , we could move forward with that. And I'll speak to them on that further on that. That's all I have for tonight . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, first, I wanted to thank Councilman Smurl for the update about the playground at Nay Aug. I'm glad to hear that's been correct ed. I'm also glad to hear that there was some signage added within the city parks. I would like to know why the handicap signs haven't been changed yet downtown . And I'd also like an update on where we're at with our street signs which I know Miss Jeffries has been asking about for quite a while. So if they were able to do those signs, I want to know why other signs haven't been done or what else has been throughout the city. So if we can get an overall update on signage that would be appreciated . And I also wanted to bring up the walkability study. I'm glad to hear that there will be the event at Lackawanna College in a few weeks. But I do want to know what a clear timeline looks like for that study and when it will be completed and what the next steps are. So, Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 Voldenberg , if you would be able to inquire about that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And there was one more topic that I wanted to bring up tonight . And it's something that we've discussed in the past. I brought it up in our caucus tonight too. Usually around budget time is when we've asked about it. But the employee performance reviews or the lack thereof that we have within the city, I think if we have a problem retaining employees in our city. That's one way to help keep people is by having performance reviews and having goals for employees and letting them know how they are doing. And I would like to see us develop those. And last we had heard that was something that the city was interested in doing but I don't know what movement there's been on that. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could also get an update on performance reviews . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll contact HR in the morning .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. That's all I have. MR. SCHUSTER : Can I add one more thing there? I know we've been asking about the performance reviews for quite some time now. Can we also add exit reviews to that? I think that will give us insight as why the employees are leaving are leaving . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild and Mr. Schuster . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I agree with Dr. Rothchild . I have been asking, personally asking for yearly performance appraisals for the past three years I'm here. And I've been told by administration that we're working on them. So let's really see if they were working on them and if it's actually happening because every year they come to us they'll say, well, they deserve a raise. And I say based on what, their performance ? There's no evidence of that. So please circle around and let's finalize that. And also, it was brought to our attention 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 yesterday -- between yesterday and today that a new parks director was hired. And I'm glad. We need one. We've been without one for too long but it didn't come down to us yet. So because it hasn't, I would like to see this gentleman 's resume along with a job description . And also, the lovely ladies of the Weston Field that, you know, have been having issues with lifeguard s and have been making great recommendations , I know that during -- after Director Duffy left for the interim Mr. West was the interim director . And, you know, these ladies made some great recommendations and one was and we sent it over twice to administration . One was that was upon hire of a new parks director could they please also be certified , a lifeguard certified or gain that certification upon hire because their office is there. And then the lack of having lifeguard s, especially in the winter months when all the school kids go back, having a person in the office there can just be an extra lifeguard when needed. So could you please 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 look into that for me, just see if that was part of the process in addition to, of course, we want, you know, all of us want the resume and the job description . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : That is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Just to follow up with some of the question s from speaker s from last week, Joan Hodowanitz , the new auditor Clifton LarsonAllen, LLP, Matt Domines ' the Finance Director discuss ed with the new auditor an agreement made to include 10 percent late penalty fee in addition to audit completion date of September 30th, 2023. CLA will also provide monthly updates to the city. We're going to be amending that contract tonight before we approve it. The nonresident tax inquiry , per John Murray our City Controller , the nonresident tax is a tax that's allowed to be assessed by a municipality on employee s who work within the municipality and are not charged a wage tax in their home district or paying a percentage less than one percent .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 In other words, if a person travels from City A to work in City B and City A has no wage tax, then City B can assess a tax not greater than one percent . With that being said, should City A have a .5 percent wage tax then City B can assess of .5 percent wage tax as well. And again, this tax can only be assessed to those who do not pay a local wage tax to their home municipality or pay a wage tax of less than one percent and the city they work in can assess the difference . PPT 2023 payment clarification , per Matt Domines ' the City Finance Director , some taxpayer s have already made their 2023 fourth quarter payments . This occurred last year at this time. These are probably taxpayers who make estimated tax payments. I would not be surprise d to see a few second quarter or third quarter payment s show up over the next few weeks. Making sure PPT receipts attributable to the appropriate quarter is important . And he has a list of numbers here. Firefighters contract , request sent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 to the Law Department and IT to post the collect bargain ing agreement on the city website . The arbitration award agreement was posted on April 5th. Les Spindler had requested DPW Director of Roads and supervisor visit Mr. Spindler at the intersection of Bulwer Street and North Rebecca Avenue to clarify repair and road paving timeline. John F. Kennedy Elementary School, 200 Winfield Avenue, this was one that came into me. Scranton Police Department met with the Scranton School District Safety Officer and the school principal to discuss updates and changes to the pickup and drop off of students in that area of the school. Barricade s and additional school resource officer s are in discussion . SPD A shift will monitor the area at school pickup and drop-off times. Following request s were sent on May 23rd, which is today 3 Mountain Lake Road, DPW will visit the address to review water issues at the base of a homeowner 's driveway . The HRG study is done and awaiting design for the East Mountain Stormwater 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 Project . 1515 Cherry Street, the resident is awaiting DPW to visit his address with the vac truck to check the drainage line in the middle of Cherry Street at the end of his driveway . A resident advised DPW is aware of the issue and set to return. However , the vac truck remains out of service as of today May 23rd it's being fixed. Additional note -- let's see. Quandel Project , I know Kristen and Evann Xanthis , 1700 block of Dickson Avenue, spoke with the Mayor and she's going to have Quandel Project Management contact ed to be more receptive and assist the Xanthis family regarding their concerns . Also, I do expect that we're going to get the name come up next week for the Parks and Rec Director to be considered . I know that there was Scranton Police Department arbitration -- at least I know there was one scheduled today. I'm not sure if they actually met. But I believe there was an arbitration hearing today. They are getting close with the OECD Director . I think they're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 down -- they have final candidates . And from what I understand , they are both from the City of Scranton . The Scranton Redevelopment Authority Director , the board meets quarterly . There has not been a director since the Doherty administration . It's all funded through the Redevelopment Authority . I think we're going to be seeing a name come up soon. And then auditing -- oh, I already talked about the audit. That's all I have at this time. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , tonight I'll be voting no to this piece of legislation . I do think at this point in time as I said in previous weeks, the waiver was given at about $52,000 a year salary. It's risen from 52,000 to 120. Back when Mr. Bulzoni was the Business Administrator , he was supposedly going to move into the city and his salary was around $89,000. And, you know, he had left the administration here. But I do feel with the salary over 120, I think we should be moving into the city. And for that reason I will be voting no. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so there is no way that I would approve without -- because of this waiver of the highest -- the person making the highest salary in the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 $120,000 doesn't have to live here. The fine police officer in the back room who protect s and serves us every day has to live here to do so. The rest of the police department , the rest of the fire department , DPW, and every other worker in the city except one has to live here to work here. Except for the one who is paid the most. So this doesn't settle with me. I've always been against the residency waiver and I continue to do so. So I will be a no. MR. KING: Anything further on the question ? It's my understanding that she is paying that additional payment ; is that correct ? I think we got an e-mail on that -- MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , Mr. King. MR. KING: -- from John Murray since she was hired. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR.
