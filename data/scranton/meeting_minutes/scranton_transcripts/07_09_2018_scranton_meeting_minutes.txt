REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment : Gene Besko spoke on city business . Lenny Srebro spoke on city business . Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business . Marie Schumacher spoke on agenda items and city business . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on city business and matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: I just have a few. The first is I have had requests for a "children at Play" sign in Kurst Court in the 2700 block. Apparently , there is a lot of children in that area and there is a lack of a sign warning alley drivers to slow down, so if we can get DPW on that that would be very great. Also, Ms. Hodowanitz brought up the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Arcadis study and the audit again. If we could get something out to the business administrator and ask Mr. Bulzoni if council can expect and would like to see come kind of update before August recess on both of those. And some business on the agenda, there is an appointment of Sean Walsh to the zoning board. His personal property taxes are up-to-date, his business property taxes are up-to-date, but with all full disclosure he owns property that has nobody living there and it's scheduled for demo. He has applied for a variance on his garbage fees for that and was granted it, so all his taxes and fees are paid up-to-date according to our treasurer . And, finally , Mr. Gaughan already brought this up because I was asked the same questions , Friday, July 13, and Friday the July 20, 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. at our DPW offices there will be our electronic collection for the month of July. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 any motions or comments . MR. EVANS: Thank you. First of all, it is my understanding that the audit is expected by the end of July or the first week of August. We are pressing for the end of the July so that's based on your comments , of course, that there is certainly justification for the end of July to be the target date so it's out there before our August recess. I attended the first Friday event on July 6 in downtown Scranton . Finally , after some less than favorable weather conditions over the last few events the organizers and many of the volunteers were rewarded for all of their hard work and with perfect weather . If anyone wants to know what a vibrant , exciting , interesting and fun downtown looks like I would encourage them to a attend a First Friday event in downtown Scranton . While the naysayers will tell you we are depressed and distressed and downtrodden city, the reality of what is experienced in our city on a First Friday stands in stark contrast to that image and that dialogue . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Hundreds and hundreds of people walking the streets of downtown , visiting art galleries and crowded restaurants , enjoying great music and art of many various venues. This is what the arts and culture and music and even good food can bring and do for a city. This is why cities invest and encourage and grow their arts community . That is why I believe so strongly that any investments in the arts will always pay great dividends . And to those that don't get it, I can only say sorry that you lack the vision that many other people certainly have. Also, I attended the annual Scrantastic fireworks display and concert on courthouse square on July 3 and it was another great event for our area as thousands of people descended on downtown Scranton to enjoy that event as well. Speaking of fireworks, the annual explosion in our neighbor hoods has contributed to the Fourth of July each year was back with a vengeance again this year. I'm not sure if it was attributed more to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 the changes in the state law legalizing the sale of fireworks or other factors , but I do know that many residents and homeowners in every part of the city felt they were under attack in their own homes. As fireworks were set off all around them, many much later into the night than should have been allowed . The police department has an almost impossible task with enforcement with this issue so if there is anything that we can do on a legislative front that would allow for the SPD to have an easier time addressing this issue, I would absolutely be in favor of it. We have 100 plus year old housing stock and clearly we are dodging a serious situation that could lead to injuries or home fires or even worse all because of the hundreds of amateurs shooting off fireworks throughout the city. So, Ms. Reed, if you could send a letter to Chief Graziano to see if there is anything we could to do to help him and the SPD to the local laws that govern fireworks in our city. And one final note, I want to send a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 shout out to my younger brother , Keith Evans, who is visiting from his beautiful home in Sonoma County, California . He still remains very much a Scrantonian at heart and has been very impressed the things that are happening in Scranton . Sometimes it takes those visiting or returning from outside of the city to see what many of us many times are unable to see. And that's all I have for today. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. I just remand all residents of North Scranton that there is an extremely important zoning board meeting this Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. in council chambers regarding the proposed building of apartments off of Wale Street and also near the Vo-Tech. I think it's 200 and some apartments that they want to build and ten buildings . I did meet with several residents of North Scranton this past Saturday and to say there are concerns is putting it mildly. I have my own concerns about the quality of life that I think will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 deteriorate if this complex goes up, and also with traffic issues and there is a number of other things so hopefully we will be able to get some questions answered this Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. on that issue. Mrs. Reed, 201-203 Pittston Avenue a gentleman stopped me, there is overgrown grass. He would like to know if the bank owns that property . There is also a property on Fourth Avenue that I'll be getting you the address some issues with high grass there as well. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Just a couple of comments following up on what Councilman Gaughan mentioned regarding the proposed , I don't know if it's going to be a housing project or housing complex , I have had a lot of people reach out to me as well and we did receive correspondence from the attorneys for the company that's located out of town the plans on putting in this development . One of the items that wasn't mentioned so far is that the city just paved Greenbush and Reeve Street which are the two main roads going up to and back out of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Vo-Tech at a significant cost, obviously , and they were two of the worst roads in the city. The other question I have is if this construction project does move forward obviously bringing heavy equipment in and out of that area may cause damage to those roads as well. Again, I'm sure the zoning board will give a full and fair hearing to this group, but I know there are going to be a lot of residents in the city that are going to come out in opposition to this project because of the size and the scope. Personally , I support any type of growth in the city we could see, but it has to be done in a manageable way. It has to being done in areas where it makes sense. This many apartments on this small of a parcel and it's I think it was noted in the paper it's a very unique size parcel to put this many units on three stories high, so as Councilman Gaughan mention ed there are a lot of concerns from residents not only in North Scranton but throughout the city as well so that is a very important zoning meeting that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 is coming up. And that is all I have for now. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION - A RESOLUTION - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AN DENTER INTO A PROFESSIONAL SERVICE CONTRACT WITH ABRAHAMSEN , CONABOY & ABRAHAMSEN , P.C. FOR SPECIAL LABOR COUNSEL LEGAL SERVICE FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . First, I had several questions and concerns about this contract . Number one, back in March of 2014 this council had granted a contract to Abrahamsen , Conaboy and Abrahamsen that was for four years and would have expired in March of 2018, so my first question is why did it take so long to bid this out and why is the city just now awarding a contract four months after the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 expiration of the original one? Second, where did the city advertise this RFP? Was it advertised in the Jurist, which is for members of the Lackawanna Bar Association . In 2014, the City of Scranton had seven bidders for the labor contract . In 2018, we have two. Did the city inform previous bidders in 2014 who were interested then? I find it odd that there is such a lack of interest for this contract and the other firm was from Pittsburgh . I'd like to know how much Abrahamsen , Conaboy and Abrahamsen billed the city pursuant to the previous labor contract and for all work performed for the city during that time period, so 2014 to date. Has the city been successful in defending any grievances or any labor matters that have gone before arbitration ? I would like a percentage that the city has actually won? Also, Mrs. Schumacher brought this, and I agree, in the RFP it mentions that the city would prefer that the firm who is awarded this have experience and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 understanding of the unique culture of the City of Scranton 's labor unions. They put a strong preference towards firm who have that unique experience . I believe that as long as the firm has experience in dealing with Municipal Law Act 111 Grievances and Interest arbitration experience in Appellate Court practice and knowledge of the workings and functions of local and state government , they should be more than qualified . I think that the city is possibly making this one sided by putting in language like that and giving firms like Abrahamsen , Conaboy and Abrahamsen an unfair advantage . It doesn't take much to get up to speed on the culture of Scranton 's labor unions. Read the newspaper or figure it out. The last thing, and probably the most concerning , in the backup legislation under Attachment E, "Disclosures by current contractors ," it says the following , and this is in the RFP. "Number five, since January 1, 2011, has the contractor made any contribution to a municipal official or candidate for municipal office in the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 of Scranton ? If yes, please identify te recipient , the amount and the date of the contribution ." Very, very, very clear. Mr. Abrahamsen notes in his response that he donated to Mayor Courtright , Councilman Rogan and Councilman Perry, but he does not identify the amount or the date of the contribution . This is the same for number eight under Attachment E. I find it absolutely ludicrous that Mr. Abrahamsen cannot comply with the simple request and a request for proposals . Can he read? Can anyone in the law firm read? The request here was crystal clear. Why is he omitting this information ? This reeks as an effort to once again avoid transparency to the City of Scranton residents . Here we go again. Where is the transparency ? How much did he give and when did he give it? If you can't comply with a simple request then don't submit a proposal. Are we going to have to wait months to get this information and will I be sued again for asking? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Second, I feel it's important to remind my colleagues and the public about Ned Abrahamsen 's spineless actions against me a year ago. Last year, around this time, I had been requesting documentation that showed exactly what Mr. Abrahamsen had done as the city's special counsel for the parking and sewer deal transactions in which he received $400,000 of ratepayer and taxpayer money. I was concerned to find out that Mr. Abrahamsen had no written contract with the city as special council , but was hired under an oral arrangement or an oral contract in which Mayor Courtright and then City Solicitor Jason Shrive told Mr. Abrahamsen to go to work. I found this extremely odd and not the least bit transparent . My request for information went unanswered and ignored . Then on July 17, 2017, Mr. Abrahamsen and his law firm filed notice in Lackawanna County Court that they intended to sue me for slander . This was clearly a gutless, cowardly attempt my Ned Abrahamsen to silence me, to intimidate me, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 bully me so that I would stop asking questions and stop doing my job fighting for the people of this city. It's my belief that Ned Abrahamsen and his law firm knew that there was no way they could win in lawsuit because I had done absolutely nothing wrong. And they decided to try to drag me through the mud and retaliate against me for asking tough questions . Clearly a case of a baseless political attack and a frivolous lawsuit attached to it. On September 5, I obtained a Court directive requiring Abrahamsen , Conaboy and to file an actual lawsuit within 20 days or have the case dismissed . On September 29, 2017, the matter was dropped by Mr. Abrahamsen and his law firm. An attorney from the law firm said in the newspaper that the matter was dropped without prejudice which means that it can be refiled at any time. Again, in my opinion and it's a clear attempt to dangle this lawsuit over my head and the hopes that I would keep my mouth shut. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 I asked Attorney Minora in the caucus if this was a conflict that we are possibly going to hire a law firm for labor counsel who has threatened to sue the city, to sue me, and is going to continue to dangle this lawsuit over my head for how long I don't know. I'd like to read some quotes from my colleagues from the July 20, 2017, council meeting in response to Mr. Abrahamsen 's lawsuit against me. Threatening of a lawsuit I don't think is proper, former Councilman Wechsler said. We are a body. You sue one member as far as I'm concerned you are suing all of us. Calling a slander suit against a council man a slipper slope. Tim Perry said that means a different councilman could be next. What does that do to the core of our democracy ? It's not the correct way to handle this, Mr. Perry said. Councilman Wayne Evans said, "Such a lawsuit sends a chilling effect on the very principle of free speech relating to public officials and the fundamental right of elected official s to ask hard questions and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 demand accountability of others. For the record, I stand with Councilman Gaughan ." I would like to ask my colleagues how they can justify in good conscience rewarding this law firm and Ned Abrahamsen with another labor contract after witnessing their tactics in which they tried to use the legal system to stifle and scare and intimidate and bully a public official . For the record, I have zero confidence in Mr. Abrahamsen or his law firm to do work with the City of Scranton . And at this time in relation to the questions I asked in the beginning I would like to make a motion to table agenda Item 5-B. MR. ROGAN: A motion has been made, is there a second? The motion fails for lack of a second. MR. GAUGHAN : The reason I made the motion to table, ladies and gentlemen , and this was discussed in the back room, is to get the questions answered before the final vote, which would be next week, and I think it's important that we do make a motion to table because there has been a history here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 between Mr. Abrahamsen and his law firm on not answering questions that are posed by government officials and dragging it out for months, so I thought that was important . Obviously , my colleagues don't. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the question ? MR. EVANS: Yes, on the question . Of course I was one of first to speak out against the propose d lawsuit filed against Councilman Gaughan and I still feel that way. It was an affront to all of us and our ability for members of city council to speak freely and criticize and ask the tough questions when needed and councilman Gaughan 's questions on this resolution need to be answered . I advised Councilman Gaughan in caucus that if any of our questions are not answered prior to next week's meeting I will second his motion to table and will not on vote on this contract until those questions are answered so the clock is ticking . MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question . We did -- as both colleagues said, we did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 discuss this in caucus and I was on the side to give them a week to answer these questions . I know I was mentioned in this, I have nothing to hide. I believe that once we start to pick and chose what questions get answered on an RFQ then we lost. If it's on the RFQ to be answered then it needs to be answered . We are not allowed to pick and choose what gets answered and what doesn't. It all gets answered or then what's the point of having one. So, yes, I will not vote for it if it doesn't -- all those questions don't get answered , and I give them a week to get those answers to us. If we don't get those answers this gets tabled next week. MR. ROGAN: I would agree with Councilman Perry and Evans and it's typical practice of council on an introductory vote there generally are questions that come up, we usually give a week depending on whether it's an ordinance or a resolution , one to two weeks to get everything sorted out and then at that point either an up or down vote or items can be tabled, so I think that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 practice in the past has worked, but I do agree with I think everyone that there are some legitimate questions regarding some omissions on the contract . All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? MR. GAUGHAN : No. MR. ROGAN: The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C.

Yes, last week I did mention a concern that it seems a number of these grants are going to the same individual . I did receive a call from Senator Blake's Office to discuss this matter and I did not have a chance to get back with him. What I think I would like to do, not specifically to this project but also just in general regarding the RACP program , is having a representative from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 Senator Blake's Office and one of the state representatives come in and just give a better -- so we could have a better understanding of the application process and the selection process . As I mention ed last week, I do fully support this project . I think it's a great project my concern and question is really more on the allocation process of these dollars so that's something that we will be looking into as time goes on, but as far as this project goes I will be voting yes. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please? MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Evans. MR. EVANS: Yes. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS.
