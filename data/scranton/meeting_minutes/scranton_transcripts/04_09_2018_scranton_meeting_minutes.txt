REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment : Les Spindler spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Al Young spoke on city business . Lenny Srebro spoke on city business . Robert Shaw spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Joan Hodowanitz spoke on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 matters of general concern . Nadine Simms spoke on city business . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on agenda items and matters and city business .) MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes, just very quickly . We did mention that Mr. Pocius was in our caucus today. I want to thank him for taking the time and debriefing us on a lot of joint efforts between Scranton and PennDOT issues regarding several of the bridges in the area that were a project that we start soon. It also reminded about another popular program that we have that actually I haven't really mentioned it in awhile and that's the Scranton Fire Department 's fire prevention program . They run a very, very good program where anybody can give a phone call, and I will give you the number, and you can get your name on the list, the fire department will come out and install fire alarms in your homes on different floors and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 also add a Co2 detector . They will put those out as they have inventory and when inventory runs out they will go and order some new ones and then pick up a list where they left off so even if they don't get to you right away your name is on the list and it's a very good program to have. It's very safe and effective , it's good for your family, and it's also good for the fire department to come in and they, you know, they can really -- it really speeds up the efforts and keeps people as safe as possible . The phone number, if you are interested in that, is 570-348-4132 and give them a call and get your name on the list to take part in this great program . You know, it could be lifesaving, as anybody knows who has had a fire and has lost some things and hopefully never will. That's all I have as far as motions and comments and I'll save the rest of my comments for agenda items. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. DONAHUE : Yes, first off, I'd like to make a motion to table Item 7-B in order to obtain some more information from the administration . MR. ROGAN: A motion has been made, is there a second? MR. PERRY: I'll second that. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . You know, I have several issues with this, I'm going to vote against tabling . I had questions last Monday and we just got an answer to my question , we were just handed the letter at the end of our caucus so it's very difficult to have time to even review it which, number one, I find unacceptable . I asked for the funding sources , what was grant funded, what was budgeted , I assume that I was being specific there, but we got a very non-specific answer from the city solicitor . It's my belief that RFQ should be evaluated with a scoring percentage for each requested requirement and that I think that's the most fair process for making an award. I don't see that in this RFQ. In 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 the fee schedule for Peters Design, as it is stated and negotiate a price for construction monitoring , so in my opinion that would be a separate price and a separate percentage of the engineering and construction contract and final cost of the project . So my fear is that the sky could be the limit here. I mean, you know, Peters Design could really name their price at the end and we would be at their mercy. My concern is if we vote to give this contract to Peters Design at this point another bidder could make the argument that the process was unfair because the RFQ did not request a negotiated fee for construction monitoring so it's possible that the other bidders included that fee in their base bid. I also have concerns in the RFQ, you will notice bidders were not allowed to see a proposed budget or at least an estimate . They also were not allowed to tour the entire facility , including the inside of the building , and this is highly unusual in my opinion , and I also believe that there is an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 issue with the disclosure portion of the contract I'm not sure that that was filled out right as well, so usually I would vote to table this, but we have had a week, we asked the questions , we asked that the city solicitor come to the caucus, if this was that important to the administration they would have sent an official it come and an answer our questions . Again, this was discuss last week so I don't really understand what the hold is up so I'll be voting "no" on tabling and when this does come for a final vote I will be voting "no". MR. ROGAN: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I have the same concerns as Mr. Gaughan , and we have talked about them over the last week, and I'd really just like to table this just to get the administration the ability to answer our questions , but from my perspective as it's written right now I would not be voting against it unless I'm satisfied with the administration 's response . MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question . I think we talked about this when it was in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 fifth order as well. There is a lot of issues here that do not need to be answered . As Councilman Gaughan said, we did get a letter just as our meeting was going to start, and I agree, I think that we need some answers to some of these serious questions . I'm not -- and I'm not at the point where I'm ready to vote "no" on this legislation because I think it's important and a "no" vote, if we do approve this legislation then the process starts all over again so I'm willing to find that middle ground, and let's table this and let's get information we need and let's make the most educated decision we could based on all of the information once we receive it. MR. GAUGHAN : Just to add one thing, I did bring these concerns up last week, we did ask a member of the administration to come, whether it was a city solicitor or the acting business administrator or whoever , and nobody showed up. So, you know, again, if it's that important to the administration then send someone to answer our questions , and then we get hand delivered this letter, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 you know, five minutes before we come out on the floor for a final vote on this thing so I just find the process , again, unacceptable and I don't think the administration is showing this legislative body the respect it deserves when it wants us to vote on legislation . MR. ROGAN: I agree with Councilman Donahue 's motion to table it. I think, you know, we gave really a six-day notice to try and get somebody here. We did receive a reply from questions that were sent from the administration . There are some more questions and I think the right move is to table it, try to get that information and then give it an up or down vote. I know that Councilman Gaughan has been against this project from the beginning so I understand his objections . On the other hand, I have been for this project from the beginning , we have to make sure we get this right and get the proper information and then give it an up or down vote. MR. EVANS: I agree. On the question , I believe it's a prudent and a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 sound move to table it and to stop the clock, give us another week to get the information we want and then bring it back for a vote, so I'll be voting "yes" to table it. MR. ROGAN: It may be two weeks because we do you have a caucus that will probably be lengthy next week regarding the traffic study for Sheetz at 5:14 so it may be until the following week until we get that scheduled . Anyone else on the question ? All in favor of the motion to table signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? MR. GAUGHAN : No. MR. ROGAN: The ayes have it and the item is tabled. On another note, I am hopeful that the school board will pass the resolution this evening approving the shared services committee with the city that council approved a few weeks ago. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 I have also gotten a couple of the questions about when the city will be sending out the garbage bills so, Mrs. Reed, would you be able to send a letter to the Treasurer 's Office inquiring about when the garbage bills will be going out? And I would also like to briefly respond to the majority commissioners ridiculous letter to the editor that appeared in the Times-Tribune last week. First off, the majority commissioners , and I quote, "Commit to 214,000 residents of Lackawanna County." If the true commitment was to all residents of Lackawanna County they would actually put the time -- the time in to research all of the facts surround ing the reassessment . If they actually do that, they would find out that their concerns about causing , and I quote "undue financial burden on residents or to see anybody lose their homes", then they would actually find out that any undue financial burden of property owners can actually be avoided by developing sound policies to go along with reassessment , but actually putting the work 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 in is a lot harder than getting their picture taken. Secondly , this has nothing to do with city finance s, as they allege. This is about having a fair and equitable tax structure that would actually spur economic development instead of the current structure which is detrimental to economic development . Also, I find it quite ironic that Commissioner O'Malley actually brought up the issue of transparency in the letter. If Mr. O'Malley was truly interested in transparency , maybe he should consider telling the public what he knew about sex abuse claims at the Lackawanna County prison both during his time as a guard and his time as a Lackawanna County Commissioner , or maybe he should consider just letting the public know about his time as a school director when Dan Sanski was hired as district fleet manager and started receiving benefits even though he wasn't a district employee , and also how Mr. Sanski miraculously hired by Colts after being let 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 go by the district . If he was truly concerned about transparency , I suggest he start there. Lastly, council has already authorized the mayor to file suit on this issue, and since it's obvious the majority commissioners are only interested in political grandstanding and not finding common ground, the question I have for the mayor is what are you waiting for? Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: A couple of brief comments since the subject was brought up I guess I'll go there. Our door is always open for future meetings to discuss reassessment . However , I agree with Councilman President Rogan when he said if there is going to be another meeting it sudden be held here in council chambers where hopefully any more attempts to misdirect or delay the discussion can be avoided and we can have a real conversation about reassessment . We can do it in a work 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 session , all five councilmen can participate , as here were three commissioners at the previous meeting . But before the meeting is even scheduled , I would expect the question that they posed at the last meeting be answered , under what circumstances , if any, would you be willing to do a reassessment ? And we haven't gotten an answer yet. So if they can provide that answer prior to the meeting , we can finally have a framework for which we can build on. If not, I'll be honest, I'm not really sure what good another meeting will actually do or what kind of benefit s there would be from another meeting . Also, on this Sheetz issue, as was mentioned before, we have a caucus schedule d for next week with Reilly Associates to discuss the traffic light situation or legislation from the Sheetz proposal . Our focus and responsibilities are fairly narrow and pertaining to the legislation before us. Tabling the legislation to get some more information on the traffic signalization and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 traffic study as well making sure pedestrian safety is ensured is a fairly routine matter and should be viewed as nothing more than that. It is not a review of the total project , or the impact Sheetz may or may not have on other businesses in the area. And, finally , last week we discussed briefly See, Click, Fix. This is simply an idea that we are exploring . Whenever we have an opportunity to increase productivity and efficiency in city hall as well engaging more citizens , we should discuss and review that opportunity . After the demonstration of the product , city council will weigh the benefit s versus the costs and determine if it's something really we will ask the administration to move forward on. So a Power Point presentation is planned for May 7 in the Governor 's Room at 5:15 as part of our public caucus to explore this issue a little bit more, and that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. First, Mrs. Reed, if we could get from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 administration possibly an update on the situation at Mr. Young's property with the hole he has been dealing with for the past three years I'd like an update on that. Also, as I mentioned , Mr. Srebro, we'll try to get a map of the neighborhood for him from our city planner if that's the correct course to go through Mr. King so try to get that for him. I mentioned this last year, there is a damaged fence at the intersection of Third Avenue and Luzerne Street. The six-foot chain link fence runs along Third Avenue above the bank of the Lackawanna County Heritage Valley Trail. There is a large section that is really badly damaged and there is nothing at this point to stop a child or a dog from going over the bank and getting seriously injured so I did ask this a letter be sent, after Mrs. Reed did some research on it, on July 20 of last year to the SRA, the Scranton Redevelopment Authority . They own that small portion of the land. They did contact the LHVA about purchasing that land so, Mrs. Reed, I ask 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 just for an update on that. I keep getting concerns , and rightfully so, from the neighbors there, but they are not concerned about who owns it. They are concerned about getting it fixed so someone doesn't get hurt, especially now with the new fields there that the University of Scranton put in. There is increased foot traffic and with the trail there is people from the neighborhood that go up that way so I would wait to see something tragic happen, so if we can ask for an update on that. Secondly , it was announced this morning that Henry Amoroso signed on for another year as Mayor Courtright's financial individual or the contract is through the Scranton Chamber of Commerce and the salary for Mr. Amoroso is apparently being funded by Geisinger , Allied and Lackawanna College . So, Mrs. Reed, I would like to request a copy of that contract from the Chamber because I'd like to know what exactly Mr. Amoroso will be doing, what is deliver ables are over the next year. He is getting paid $60,000. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 I'd also like to ask the mayor for an update on when he will hire a new business administrator or if he is planning on hiring a new business administrator . Neighbors in the Greenridge area asked for an update on the Lace Works project so we are still waiting on that. I have spoken to several neighbors this week and they are curious and anxious to know what stage the project is and where the developers are with that. Several residents reach out to me in the last week regarding the city street sweeping and it was brought up here tonight . I do believe that the schedule should be out soon because last year they started the first week of May. Again, I'll mention this, residents would like to be notified when the sweeper is coming through their neighborhood so that they can move their cars so I urge the mayor again to have DPW notify the residents whether they put a flyer on the street poles or something to that effect so that people are aware. You know, not everybody watches the council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 meetings and I know we announce them every week when the schedule does come out, but it would be helpful if people knew when exactly they were coming through their neighborhood . After receiving some conflicting information regarding the appointment of Mr. Casciano , the former business administrator to the position of Equal Opportunities Specialist and Administrative Assistant in OECD, the Office of Economic and Community Development , I did have additional questions which I posed to the administration over the past few weeks. Number one, what day-to-day housing and urban development activities are assigned to Mr. Casciano , please be specific . In an e-mail I received March 20 in response to my question regarding the job description for this position , the city administration stated that a portion of Mr. Casiano 's work would be focused on Crowly Park, and my question was has Crowly Park has that project been funded at all by HUD. Also in the e-mail from March 20 it was stated that Mr. Casciano would be the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 OECD liaison with Scranton Tomorrow and I asked how HUD funds have been provided for this coordination and liaison initiative . And I ask these questions , as I mentioned a few weeks ago, because I am concerned , as I stated recently , that the city may be danger of losing federal funding if Mr. Casciano is doing work that is not related to projects that receive federal funds from HUD and outside of the scope of the job descriptions of Equal Opportunities Specialist and Administrative Assistant , and I was confused, there was some conflicting information we were told at first that he would be the Economic Development Specialist , and when I did question that because that was position is not a line item in the budget, that was pointed out to me that he was actually hired as the Equal Opportunity Specialist and Administrative Assistant at a salary of $43,000 whatever combining that position . So, again, I just want to make sure that, you know, we don't turn around in a year when we get audited by HUD to pay any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 money back so that was my concern there. And, lastly, as was pointed out in the newspaper , the Scranton Composite Pension Board voted Wednesday to evenly split 90 percent of the $22.9 million in sewer sale proceeds between the fire and the police funds with the remaining 10 percent going to the non-uniform fund. The three funds are each categorized as severely distressed , which is defined as a funding ratio of less than 50 percent . The addition of $10.3 million in sewer proceeds to the police plan will increase it's funding ratio to 59.9 percent and improve it's rating to moderately distressed . The non-uniform fund, which will receive $2.3 also will improve to moderately distressed with a funding ratio of 56.6 percent . The fire fund will receive the same $10.3 million as the police fund, however , because it's financial condition is much worse, the funding ratio will only increase to 38.2 percent which still leaves it severely financially distressed . There was an analysis that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 conducted by Randy Sekol, who is the plan's actuary , and he found the fire fund would be roughly $19 1/2 million or 85 percent of the sewer proceeds to bring it's funding ratio to 49.2 percent which would leave at that point just $1.9 or 8 1/2 percent for the police fund and result in a funding ratio of 49.1 percent , non-uniform fund would be get 1 1/2 million , or 6.5 percent , and have a funding ratio of 49.2 percent . So if they went with that plan, all of the funds would be roughly around 50 percent . The board voted five to two, five in favor two against with one abstention to approve the allocation . I have posed this question to the administration because I still do not understand why the mayor's proxy or why the mayor voted to abstain from voting. What kind of leader abstains and then does not give a position on this for such an important vote? I mean, you are voting on spending $22.9 million in sewer sale proceeds and the city abstains and it doesn't give a reason for abstaining . I was under the impression that if you abstain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 from a vote it either has to be a conflict of interest or you have explain why you are abstaining just as if you voted "yes" you would explain why you voted "yes" or if you voted "no" you would explain why. So, again, I would like to ask the mayor on what grounds did they abstain from voting on this important matter on the Composite Pension Board? I also question the sense of the way that this vote went down, and I'll use this analogy , and maybe I'm wrong but this is what I have been thinking over the last week since this went down, if you have two patients who come into a hospital , one is having a heart attack and the other one broke his thumb do you give the same medical care to both? No. You pay more attention to the heart attack victim because it's urgent and he needs to be taken care. And I'm not sure that this vote that went down about equally spending the proceeds should have been about fairness, but maybe about the health of the overall pension funds. I question whether it would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 have made or sense to have similar funding levels to all three pension plans and should we be more concerned about fairness or about the long-term viability of the funds. And, also, it seemed as if, according to the e-mail chains that I received , that the vote may have been rushed. The city had to pay for a study that looked at some of these other options and it seemed to me that, you know, some members wanted to vote on this immediately . Now, what the background was, I do want to mention that I don't think we should have spent any of this money at this point until we are clear of what say may have forgotten about, a pending lawsuit over the sale, the legality of the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority , and I think we also have to remember that this is ratepayer money. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan , one item. We did receive a letter, and I wasn't sure whether I was going to read this or not, as Councilman Evans mentioned , our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 scope regarding the Sheetz project is very limited , it's strictly to the traffic issues. This letter does go into some other items but I do want to read it because it was from our state representative . So this letter came to council , I think it was last week, from State Representative Marty Flynn, and I do want to read the letter. It says, "While I have always been an extreme proponent of any new business moving or expanding into our region, particularly when it's in our legislative district , I write you today very concerned about the recent announcement of the proposed opening of a large Sheetz gas, beer and restaurant facility . The proposed 46-seat restaurant , alcohol and tobacco distributor and attended gas station will have a very serious negative effect on dozens of local businesses , including restaurant s, delis, convenient stores, small supermarkets and locally owned gas station as such as Pee-Wee's and Moletsky 's that have been paying taxes, employing people and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 supporting other local business es. I won't even go into the concerns about beer and likely wine store that will be promoted next to a high school. Additionally , there is horrible traffic congestion and safety problem every day of the week along Seventh Avenue and Providence Road. Again, while I'm fighting every day to bring businesses to help our -- or help our existing businesses to grow, the thought of bringing a mega gas station /restaurant /beer complex to our intercity in an already poorly congested area is almost beyond comprehension for me. I strongly urge you to reconsider t his pr t interest of our community our businesses and the safety and well-being of our residents and visitors . Respect fully, Marty Flynn, 11th legislative district ." So I did want to read that into the record. And that is all. MS. REED: 5-B.
