And that's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . And what is the status of the union contracts ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. DONAHUE : One has been agreed to and ratified , the DPW. We're expecting legislation on that. The other, negotiation s are still ongoing . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I notice in the Controller 's report for August that Ufberg and Associates were paid $45,919.70 for their work in August -- well, they were paid in August. That fee for the labor counsel continues to go up. And I'm just wondering what will be the final number when this is all said and done. And what is the status of the 2021 audit? MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , would you like to give an update on that? MR. SCHUSTER : Would you like me to wait until Fifth Order or would you like it now? MS. HODOWANITZ : I can't hear you. MR. SCHUSTER : Would you like me to wait until Fifth Order or -- MS. HODOWANITZ : If you would. But I will remind you that there are only 56 days until November 15th when you must have the budget present ed to you. So hopefully the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 audit and the contracts will be settled and wrapped into that budget proposals by then. Can you tell me how much money the City has collected so far under the Payroll Preparation Tax? MR. DONAHUE : I don't have exact numbers on that. We are planning on having a caucus on that in October . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Who's collecting that for us? MR. DONAHUE : Berkheimer . MS. HODOWANITZ : Berkheimer . And how long have we been collect ing that since June? MR. DONAHUE : So the first -- the first -- yeah, since the end of June because we extended the deadline once -- the initial deadline once to June 30th. MS. HODOWANITZ : If possible , if you could tell Berkheimer when they come to have that number available because by then you're looking at July, August, September , October . You're looking at a good four months by the time you're going to have a caucus. So that should be a substantial 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 number when you compare it to the Business and Mercantile Tax. And they should have no reason to say I don't know. They should know. Item 5-G, Community Development Properties Incorporating requesting a grant. I believe it's $210,000 for HVAC repairs to the first floor of the Linden Street Garage. Is that correct ? Is it 5-G? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : The HVAC repairs. Community Development Properties , are they a nonprofit ? MR. DONAHUE : They are. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. So they're collecting rental income from five tenants on the first floor. And they're applying for a grant. And they're a nonprofit , but they're going to collect rental. I hope they are paying taxes on that rental income. It would be a nice thing for them to confirm for us. And, you know, if I were to open Joan's Pizzeria somewhere downtown , I hope somebody , you know, thinks of my rental income and does all the repairs and maintenance for me too whether they are a profit or nonprofit . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 And speaking of non-profits , during that October caucus are we going to get the answers to the questions posed by Mr. Lazor and Attorney McGovern at that same caucus with regard to -- MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I'm hopeful . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, if not, maybe somebody should schedule a second caucus because I think that the businesses that have to pay this tax should be given that answer. I mean, money is somewhat tight. With regard to the agreement with Lackawanna College and the $1,000 that they are going to pay for use of that field through the end of the year, and I saw in the backup that they're responsible for all the operation and maintenance costs. May I assume that if those costs exceed one thousand dollars Lackawanna College is still on the hook to pay them? MR. DONAHUE : That's my understanding , yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And how much time do other public entities and general public comment get to use that field vis-a-vis 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Lackawanna College ? Has somebody put up a schedule or can they? MR. DONAHUE : I'll ask -- we'll reach out to the Parks Department to see if we could get a schedule for that. MS. HODOWANTIZ : I think that would be appropriate . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , so I don't forget, will you reach out to the Parks Department and see if they have a schedule for Lackawanna 's use for Chick Feldman ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Tim Swartz. MR. SWARTZ: All right. Thank you for the time. I'm here. I'm the President of the Hill Neighborhood Association and speaking in support of but not on behalf of the group of neighbors that live near the hospital where the zoning is changing or had been propose d to change. I want to share a couple stories with you -- quick stories with you. I was up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 at a park -- Nay Aug Park a couple days ago and I was talking with a neighbor who lives right there by the hospital . It was late at night. And I said, hey, look how beautiful the sunset is. She looked over to me and says, well, I hope I can -- I need to look at it now because I'm not going to be able to see it too much longer. Look, heartbreaking for me and I didn't really -- I felt really bad about bringing it up. Secondly , a couple weeks ago I wrote a letter to the editor about the zoning. Somebody posted it on Facebook on the Hill Neighborhood page. And one of the comment s underneath said, well, it's a small price to pay for more healthcare in the City of Scranton . I believe the City of Scranton and everybody in the hill believe s that the City of Scranton needs more health care. I think that's really clear. But more healthcare at the cost of neighborhoods and more healthcare at the cost of 50, 60 different households , that's a really stiff price to pay. And I'm not sure about paying that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 price. And I know that the neighbor s that live up there are beside themselves about paying that price. So why I'm saying all of that is please consider the amount of grief and heartache and stress and pain that have -- these neighbors have gone through in these last eight months as you think about the zoning. These are incredible life changes that are being forced upon people. I think if that was forced upon me, it would be terrible to try to build up my -- pack up my entire house, pack up my kids, pack up my family, leave all the memories from years of raising my kids and years of living with my friends behind and go find another place to live, which to be argumenta tive I'm not sure it would be in the City of Scranton because of taxes and schooling and all of that other stuff. But I don't want to be argumentative . If the zoning goes through as civic as -- I've talked with you all before, I think it puts every resident on call in the City. If there's a resident living near a corporation that has a really good idea like we need more healthcare in the city, if I'm a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 resident living near a corporation like that it put me on call. If they have a really good idea maybe they're going to buy up my neighborhood . Maybe they're going to try to buy up me, knock down all the houses and all of sudden I could look up and down my street just to see a barren wasteland. I would hope you would consider that as part of the zoning -- part of the zoning map that you have to vote on. Overall , I think this is a city that cares about the quality of life of our resident s. And people up on the hill will tell you that they don't want to listen to the helicopters come in. They're the ones that hear the garage door beeping every time somebody goes in. They're the ones that live with the extra lights that come with more development , more commercial development -- not commercial -- more hospital development . I don't know the right word. But we're a city that cares about the quality of life of our residents . We're a city that cares about neighborhoods . This City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 is built on neighbor hoods. That's what I've come to learn since I moved here. The City is built upon our neighborhoods . It's a city that wants to care about the livelihood s of our citizens and be concern ed about the incredible disruption that the people in those three streets up above Harrison have been dealing with for months, grief and heartache and pain and stress, so on and so forth. So I wanted to just lay that before you as you continue to consider that zoning map. I think they would want residential . I think there's easier solutions for all parties involved . And we may hear some more later this week. But please consider the resident s as well. Thanks. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Robert Lettieri . MR. LETTIERI : Members of Council , my name is Robert Lettieri . And I've lived on the corner of Green Ridge Street and Wyoming Avenue since 1944. The street car used to come down from North Washington Avenue and down Green Ridge Street and out to Marywood . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 And I'm here tonight to discuss the safety of not only that corner where I've seen multiple fatalities over the years, crashes and likewise down at the corner of Marion Street which is part of our interest in this presentation . The highway there, the road there is considered a state highway . I remember the trucks coming down there over the years before the interstate was built. And the library is expanding their access for handicap use there with some construction on that highway . Now the problem with the street there is that prepandemic the programs at the library consisted of programs for small children . And they were brought to the library in basically car seats. And I moved to the 1500 block 60 years ago. So I've been watching the traffic because I've been retired for a while. And I could see these women trying to get their children out of the car seats and put back in the car seats on the traffic side of the car -- on the driver side which would be in traffic . The pandemic cut those programs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 short. And the programs are about to start again. So I'm interested in trying to get some activity there in creating a more safe environment . That brings us down to Marion Street. Now, this 1500 block has become a speedway when people cross from Green Ridge Street up or down. And the first time they have to stop is possibly at the Larch Street, I believe it is. And my suggestion has been to PennDOT to try to consider a four-way stop sign on Marion Street. Now that seems to be a problem for PennDOT . They had a meeting with the former City engineer who said we don't want another stop sign on Wyoming Avenue. Now, I don't know if too many stop signs or if there are stop signs at all. PennDOT tells me that four-way stop signs have to be considered when you have 800 cars an hour on the main street, 200 cars an hour on the cross street. Well, I was up and down Delaware Street and all over town. There are four-way stop signs where there are not that kind of volume on the traffic . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 So we're interested in getting that kind of thing shaped up so that people will have another stop before they race down the hill into Central City or coming up from the hill. So that's an element with the narrow streets and the parking . You have the buses coming through there. Another problem we have is that UGL -- UGI -- UGL, I guess, the company up in Dunmore , they put their own signs up there directing traffic to their plant that PennDOT tells me are not authorize d but they -- they didn't put them up. And they're directing traffic onto Wyoming Avenue to get up to their place in Dunmore . I would suggest they go on Capouse Avenue which is a much wider street instead of squeezing through there with the Colts buses where there's never any passengers . They should probably use a smaller bus there. And the other trucks, all kind of trucks are using that road whether it's directed there through the GPS things which is another thing that is a possibility . But you'll hear later on from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 director of the library program for the Scranton Library 's Scott Thomas on the petition he has for a study for that corner there. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Lettieri, I'm sorry to interrupt . But your time is up. Your five minutes is up. That's all right. So I do know that the walks -- or the intersection of Green Ridge and Wyoming , the signals and everything are going to be upgraded in 2023 using the Green Light Go money, you know, we were awarded years ago. It was delayed a little bit. But it is going to be done in 2023. I'll see what we can look into on the other parts of Wyoming . And then also UGL because if I am remembering correctly , there was an issue with them going -- MR. LETTIERI : Through the smaller streets of Dunmore . MR. DONAHUE : Through the smaller -- and there was some sort of an agreement . But I'll look into that for you too. MR. LETTIERI : Now, the other thing I might mention that while the -- the traffic signal at Wyoming and Green Ridge Street is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 significant , it's only beginning to really create a safe environment for that entire block. Thanks very much. MR. DONAHUE : But they will all be upgraded with newer crosswalks and -- it's not only the lights. It's the -- MR. LETTIERI : I have been told by PennDOT they were going to put new lines on the street. They were going to try to doctor that up a little bit. Instead they just plastered a lot of signs that -- MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. LETTIERI : Including 25 miles speed signs, which I'll give you a dollar for everybody that's driving 25. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. LETTIERI : Thank you very much. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Scott Thomas. MR. THOMAS: I'm Scott Thomas, CEO of the Scranton Public Library . Mr. Lettieri did such a good job that I don't have too much to fill in there. As he said, the library is embarking on a fund-raising campaign to make the branch at the corner of Wyoming and Green 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Ridge finally compliant with Americans With Disability Act. And the program s that he referred to have started . And they've been going on since the pandemic . And the library shares Mr. Lettieri 's concern about the traffic there. And the Green Light Go Grant is really good news. We know that's going to happen. What I have here is a petition with 200 signatures about that asks the City to commission a traffic study of a four way stop sign at the corner of Marion and Wyoming because -- and we have City signatures here because it's not just the library and Mr. Lettieri. It's the neighbors as well. And even the St. Clair/St. Paul School are all very concern ed about this. And we're asking for is a traffic study that produces a document -- Mr. Lettieri made reference to a more informal one. We actually want one. We want the City to commission that. And so I'm not sure who I give the petition to but -- MR. DONAHUE : You could leave it with Allison there. And we will pass that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 along. MR. WILLIAMS : Appreciate it very much. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council . Since I was gone for two weeks do I get 15 minutes tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : No, it's only five per week. MR. ELLMAN: Must be misinformation , huh? All right. Listen, I'm going to tell you all what's on these bank statements . And this is a copy of a check I'm going to mention . So you know this isn't made up. July 29th my son had $3 in his bank account -- the one that died. And his Social Security Disability came in for 841. Okay, July 31st he died at Geisinger . August 4th I went to the bank to deposit my ex-wife sent $3,000 towards his funeral expenses . They said I had to deposit the check. So that wasn't no big thing. Finally August 10th the check was posted, you know, the bank statement -- August 10th now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 I don't know where it's been for a week. They took -- the Social Security reclaimed his 841 out of my $3,000. You know, people said they can't do that, but they did. Does anyone see where I'm going with all of this? If this group in Washington is monitoring somebody 's account with $3 in it, you could start seeing what's happening in this country . This is serious . Your cell phones can tell you almost where you're standing . The cars have black boxes. The bank tells them everything under the sun about you. That's what happened here. The bank turned in everything . They took the check that was mine and sent it back to my ex-wife after they took out like $500. There was money in the bank. They just took it. There's no -- nothing . All it says on here reclaimed Social Security . We're becoming like Germany a hundred years ago. I'm not kidding you. Whoever heard of such goings on in the past? Like I said, somebody with $3 in their bank account brings it to the attention 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 of the government . No wonder they're trying to hire 87,000 IRS people. They're going to be like an army. Do you realize -- do the people realize they're going to be armed? They can be armed. That's part of the situation with them. They're teaching them right now how to fire guns. It's been on television , an armed IRS man. Now that's really necessary in this country 87,000. They're not there to get people -- they are there to -- they are there to recover situations like this. They want to control us from birth to death if you ask me. And I'm not an alarmist . I don't know. You know, Biden dumps all those three plane loads of people on our doorstep and there is no problem . They're up there in Drums. I don't know what they're doing. But when you send stuff -- the same people up in New York and so forth it's unlawful . Diseases that never been in this country before are overtaking us -- polio. Nothing 's being done about the terrible situations . But this is proof that they are going against our rights, everybody 's rights, not just mine. Everybody is being subjected to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 this and don't know it. It takes something like this to make you realize what's going on. I didn't have an idea about this until I went to the bank. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. I have your number. I'll give you a call tomorrow , and I'll give you a number of someone that can help you out with that, okay? MR. ELLMAN: That truck is still there. MR. DONAHUE : Is it? It was ticketed though, I believe . But we'll look into that one too. That exhaust s the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. NORTON: The name is Ken Norton. I'm from Rundle Street. Anyways , the reason I'm here is we have a sewer issue over our way. Now, on a normal day the sewer's operating just fine. When you get a downpour when it rains every once in a while the check valves in the basements don't work and you wind up pumping basically raw sewage back out on the street. So anyways , I hope you didn't spend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 all the federal money because if it's possible , we've had a number of conversations with American Water, okay? Last one when I came through , this is a response from February 19th that came back from me and from Council , okay, so Council has been involved . But anyways, them results is right now you have Garrett Court, the sewers are over 100 years old; and they're just not doing their job. So I don't know if it would be a joint venture between the City and the sewer -- and American Water. I don't know how it could be, like, if you have some money that would be great to get the problem relieved over that way. Pretty much that's it. No, there is one other thing if you don't mind. Since they were talking about traffic control , I got the reminder over the Eiden Street viaduct again. Is it possible to get lines painted there so these little Toyotas understand which side of the road they should be on? That's it. MR. DONAHUE : That's the viaduct at Elm -- MR. NORTON: What's that? It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 between Rundle and St. Ann. The actual problem goes down Garrett Court and mostly stormwater flows to Main Avenue and Garrett . MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MR. NORTON: Thanks. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . It was good to hear that DPW agreed to a contract . I hope that the fire and police follow suit very soon. I did some just playing around the other day. And we are -- our budget might have some problems as Joan has been pointing out that they're not going to obviously deal with 1.2 or 1 to 2 percent cost of living. And I just did, you know, from 1 to 10 percent . And even if you go to like between 7 and 8 percent , we're going to have like 1 and a half million dollars worth of money to come up with to go back to the beginning of the year, which I'm sure will happen. So you might want to keep that in mind. And that's without any fringe benefits or anything . That's just straight salary. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 And this one's small but it just got to me. I was going through the Controller 's report and I noticed -- I didn't go back and add them all up; but people are buying things at the Daleville Ace Hardware . I would hope that when the City needs things they can find a hardware store within the City of Scranton . I think that should be just a given. And it would be helpful if we had a cash flow report made. PEL used to do that and it's not being done now. And I just wonder if there is anything you could do to -- MR. DONAHUE : So we actually started restarting our financial meetings similar to the PEL meetings , they're once a month instead of once a week. But our next one I believe is this upcoming Monday. So we'll bring that up. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. That would be helpful . And now Nay Aug. Would you please have the direction s to the swim complex covered as it is really painful to see those when you look at the pools and you see them filled in with whatever it is and you know that there's not going to be anything done there. That study -- has the study been kicked off yet, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 anybody know? MR. DONAHUE : We're waiting for a response to our correspondence last week. MS. SCHUMACHER : You know, this is just going on and on. And it's going to be a couple years. That's for sure. And then quickly on Code Enforcement , I don't think you guys ever followed through on with HR on having the, like, the position descriptions and stuff done because I asked for something and I got back and they said we can't do it because we don't have it because I don't -- what do the -- I would just really like to know what a code enforce r does. I mean, do they just wait for somebody to call them and then go out and see or do they actually -- I know they're -- pretty sure anyway that there's a person directed to a different part of the City. And like East Mountain , I go up there and it's been going, going, going. The goldenrod is probably up to my nose. And nobody does anything about it. MR. DONAHUE : Where is that? MS. SCHUMACHER : East Mountain Road. Yeah, it's 1328. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. DONAHUE : So the right side of East Mountain Road going up? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. Yeah. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. So -- MR. KING: The turn, Marie, that big sweeping turn on the right? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I hate to pick on just one person because there's other -- or one property because there's a lot more of them too. MR. DONAHUE : Is that brush or is it actual property ? MS. SCHUMACHER : No, that's property . MR. DONAHUE : That's -- okay. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. So I would really like to know what they do and when they do it if we can get that, please. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just because I know the brush -- the brush arm that we had approved back in July to get the side of the road areas, that was delivered on Monday so we could start going out and -- MS. SCHUMACHER : This is a whole property , yes. Yes. Okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. DONAHUE : We'll look into that one too. But thank you. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . The silence you've heard for almost the last four minutes is symbolic of the people's voice inside of this chamber . A number of us have come up before this body, whether it be Biden Street, whether it be zoning changes , whether it be being uncomfort able with how this City ignores its own policy by waiver. We have voiced that before this body. And what we've received in return from this body is silence to what the population wants. Our words are empty because we are not listened to as we should be. We deserve a better voice. And when we have an opinion it should not just be ignored like silence . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . Once again, I'm on this like a grisly bear on a honeycomb. And sometimes I even resemble one (inaudible ) dumps water to the sewer plant. Now, I don't know. Scott's here. He runs the library . I was wondering 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 about this reverse osmosis . And I think I have it figured out. And here's what it is. Spoiled crudites water flows down to us and the money flows up to the landfill . Reverse osmosis . We really don't need unregulated capitalism is essentially feudalism dressed up in the freshly polished coat of armor and passed off as only slightly rusty goods. You know, they're antiques . So I hope that this idea doesn't come to fruition . And it seems to be in the hands of a woman named Connolly . I don't know if she's a Miss or a Mrs. And I really don't care. If she has a couple kids I wish she'd think about what the world is going to look like if people some day -- if people keep getting these type of privileges with their environment . That water will flow down into Nay Aug creek through the gorge down through South Scranton and into the Lackawanna River. And, you know, if there is any contaminants , somebody throws a handful of those disposable batteries away, they have alkaline in them and everything else.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 So whatever gets out -- and by the way, if there is some type of accident where tsk-tsk we just didn't get things done right but it gets into the creek anyway, I mean, we should be left go for it because we're old friends , you know? I never really believe d much in philanthropy myself because I think in a lot of instances philanthropy is sanitizing a name that doesn't deserve it. I read in school in a 5th grade history book that John D. Rockefeller used to hand out shiny little dimes to poor kids on New York City streets , shiny little dimes. And when there was a labor strike in a camp called Ludlow and he hired a bunch of -- his son hired a bunch of thugs and shot over 100 people to death. And, you know, he sanitize d his name with philanthropy . So I really hope that something gets done about this. And they have their 44 years or 43 years. They don't need more. They absolutely don't need more than that. They're wealthy already beyond belief. And security has come up with the Mayor and I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 mentioned that the City isn't accessible sometimes . And, you know, I don't know what's been said to her; but there are a lot of really distasteful threats and all kinds of stuff happening all over the country . People threatening children , people threatening voting people that run the polls, all kind of things. State -- secretaries of state because the vote doesn't turn out the way that somebody liked it. So they send in a threat. And it's really a shame that people behave that way. But I do have a plan where you should not be able to ride that elevator from downstairs or get in the front door and there should be a policeman posted before you get beyond -- or any other employees including the Licensing and Inspections because people get grudges . Thank you. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? ANDREW: Hello, my name Andrew (inaudible ) while I did not actually plan on speaking today, I would like to go over some more broad opinions and critiques that I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 that I would like to share with you all, specifically when it comes to zoning. When it comes to the City of Scranton I do believe that our zoning laws are far better than the majority of American cities which completely outlaw the building of anything other than single-family homes. However , I do believe that the density of housing in our city is not sufficient to meet our housing needs and our population growth both with those being born in Scranton and the influx of immigrants into our city for whom we have not been providing enough housing . When looking over the propose d zoning ordinance for this year I noticed that for many of the residential areas of Scranton we seem to have a build limit of two stories or 35 feet, which for many of the area even just outside of the downtown doesn't seem to make much sense. And a lot of -- in our older zoning laws, we were allowed to build four or five story buildings for apartment complexes that were not only denser and allowed more housing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 in the city but were tax solvent . So we weren't wasting money on all of this supportive infrastructure for these regions in the city that simply could not pay for themselves . I do believe that we owe it to the taxpayer s of the City to come up with a zoning ordinance that uses our tax law responsibly and does not put an undue burden on the people of this City. I do hope to come back next week with, like, a more detailed opinions of mine that will be more helpful to you. But just as a general oversight I would like to voice my support for up zoning in Scranton . Thank you very much. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments . Last week I talked about the Nay Aug pool. I know it was mentioned again tonight . I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 that we really need to -- I saw that we sent a letter to the administration to ask them for a plan. I know we're talking about a master plan. We really want to see a plan for a pool at Nay Aug. So I appreciate you sending that, Mr. Voldenberg . I also had mentioned about a car that was parked up on Birch Street for about a year or nine months. 7:15 the next morning I rode by. It was gone. So whoever was responsible for removing that vehicle thank you. And the neighbors thank you so much for that. I did contact Larry West last week about -- we've receive d a letter from someone who visits the City often and talked about -- I think I mentioned it last week -- some of the entrances to our City. And I asked him -- they particularly mention ed the corner of River Street and Meadow Avenue. There were lots of signs there. It was completely overgrown. And I was happy to see that DPW sent a crew up there and they acted on that. And it looks so much better, so much cleaner , so much neater and it really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 helped improve the neighborhood and the entrance to the City. So I appreciate that. Also, I'm looking forward to having Mr. Lazor -- at least Mr. Lazor. If Mr. McGovern could join him that would be great as well to come in here to caucus and speak about the Payroll Preparation Tax. So I'll look forward to seeing that happen as soon as possible . Thank you. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. So last week there was an inquiry about the audit update. I did reach out to the auditor as well as the official s in the City that are working on the audit. And what I got was that the date of 9/30 will no longer be met. The auditors did not receive five of the document s that they were looking for by their August 1st deadline . So everyone out there, the auditor s did give an August 1st deadline . And the City has yet to meet the City's special fund, the Scranton Redevelopment Authority audit, the Sewer Authority audit, the capital assets report and also the schedule of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 expenditure s for federal awards. So that deadline will not be met. Speaking about the zoning, it's something I haven't been very vocal about. I did speak to some members in the Hill Section . It's something I really haven't said too much about lately. But one thing is, I'm going to be looking at these changes very critical ly. When I was on the Planning Commission in 2013 I did vote against the sale and the rezoning of Audubon . And what we're seeing right now is some of the fears I had at that point in time. And at that point in time I did speak about it. And I do remember when Geisinger was saying where the Audubon school is there will be a small office building and it will have underground parking . So some of these promises that were made at the time weren't lost on me and they are things that I remember . So I'm very curious to see what some of the new updates would be. And I'll be looking at them closely just so, you know. Thank you, Mr. King, for mention ing Nay Aug pool again. I'm in agreement . I do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 want to see what our plan is going to be for up there. I'm sure we'll be talking about it every week until we get that plan. That is all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few comment s. First, I was going to provide an update on I believe it's 429 Prescott Avenue where there was a fire back in March. I had mentioned last week that there has been a very large hole in the sidewalk that opened up with a storm from the few months ago. And so neighbors have been concerned and fearful to park there and the hole was getting bigger from what I was told. And I think there was even a news story last week about having a tomato plant growing out of it. So I just wanted to thank DPW for helping to address the issue because it was such a safety concern and so that now is filled in and is safe for people to be able to walk on the sidewalk there along Prescott Avenue. The next thing I wanted to bring up we received an e-mail earlier this evening from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 a resident who was complaining about handicap parking downtown in Scranton and how the handicap symbol on the parking signs is not really very obvious or visible for parkers . And they often notice that there are people parked in those spots specifically handicap designated spots that do not have a handicap placard . And so they are asking if we could request from ABM, our parking enforcement as to how they're -- if they are ticketing those people that are parked in those spots. I know they mention ed specifically Penn Avenue being problematic or places where people might be stopping in quickly or picking people up and just parking in those spots. So if there is anything that we could do to make that more obvious -- and I did notice myself too when those signs had changed a little while back that that it was really difficult to tell if it was a handicap spot or not. So I would certainly be in favor of us making changes there. They had suggested possibly painting the curb. So if we can work together with them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 to find out about what we need to do to make sure that those spots are available for when people who really need them can use them. And I don't believe I provided this last week. About two weeks ago Councilman Donahue and myself had met with representative s from American Water down at Birch Street. Birch Street was closed for about two years with work being done on it. And then when the restoration was completed neighbors and people driving through really haven't been happy with what was -- with the work that was done because there is a really large -- a couple of large bumps in the road. And from what we've received our last update from them they were going to be replacing the hatches because the hatches were loose and not the correct size that needed to be there. And so they did replace the hatches and it's not as nosey. But the paving is still a concern and an issue. So they did say that they would add it to their next paving list and have that taken care of before the cold weather hits. So we'll be holding them to that to make sure that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 that street is finally completed and better for people to drive on. The last thing that I'll just bring up quickly , I'm in agreement that we need information about Nay Aug and what's happening there. I don't think I had mentioned it last week it being in my neighborhood is especially important for me. I want to be able to use a pool there too. And I really look forward to receiving more information on the master plan. But we really want to get that as soon as possible so we could find out what that will look like. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So I'm in total agreement and sympathize with my colleagues here about the pool situation . It's pretty sad that we have to bring it up every meeting now to ask for some type of update. We were promised before we went on recess. So I guess we have to keep doing it. It's kind of embarrassing at this point to all of you out there that, you know, we don't have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 an answer for you because guess what, we're not getting any. Secondly , so two weeks ago on the 6th a concerned resident reached out to me about the Weston Field pool that is the indoor pool that is used daily. And the concerns were that it went from five days a week to three days a week to one day a week without notice to these elderly people that cherish this program . The one person told me that originally the program decades ago was called the zipper club because it was used for people that had open heart surgery and they were recuperating there. So even decades later it's still not only a place to meet socially but it's also a therapeutic place for people that are on the mend from knee replacements and surgeries . So with that said, we were concerned about it, the residents were, I was. Mr. Voldenberg sent, you know, correspondence down to Parks. And what we did receive was a response . So I brought it up on the 6th. We got a response on the 9th. It said we will be offering more swim session time at Weston along 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 with keeping the morning sessions open as much as we can with lifeguard availability . So -- and I understand that the availability of lifeguards is, you know, is an issue because most of them were either, you know, summer workers that went back to college . So with that said, this resident went back, right, so she went back and she wanted to extend her membership or re-up her membership another three months. And she was told that -- she was told that we're not going to do that. What we're going to do is take your old membership card because you lost probably 31 days and that was understood and they're just going to check off every time you come to get kind of, like, made whole. But the swimmers that go there every day devotedly, the hours are still fluctuating . The days are fluctuating . So what they really want to do is just re-up their membership , knock a month off if that's what's owed to them. If they want to pay for three months, six months or a year, they want to know that they are able to go there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 So they're offering the day back instead like I said renewing the membership . So with that said, I spoke to this resident . And, you know, sometimes citizens have the best answers or solutions for the issues or concern s that affect them the most. And I agree. Her ideas are that we should be actively recruiting lifeguard s. There's pop-ups every week or every two weeks. There's job fairs. She made it, you know, had a good idea that let's have a pop-up at Weston Field. Let's have a job fair at Weston Field and, you know, use multiple means of media. You have a pop-up, it's free media. I know it costs a lot of money and they realize to take an ad out for a lifeguard in the Scranton Times. It's costly and we all get that. But if there is more focus on this issue because she said that, you know, she ran into someone the other day getting a hot dog somewhere and it was a nice young lady there that said, you know, she's a part-time lifeguard . We didn't know. We'd love to know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 that there is availability between classes say if you are going to the U or Marywood for the morning program . She also said -- this young girl said, you know, we have a list of 12 lifeguard s at the Scranton Country Club. So with that said, like, her ideas are go, reach out to the college s and country club. As a culinary instructor people call me. I post job opening s outside of my classroom or in my Google classroom . So they feel like this is being put on the back burner. And they also suggest that, you know, maybe whoever is in charge there or even the Director should have some type of lifeguard training or certification so they could fill in to keep this program going. So with that said because in that one letter we were told that, you know, there was a lifeguard -- this was two weeks ago. This came from Parks and Rec there was a lifeguard that was out on COVID. There was a lifeguard that was on vacation . So where are they with regards to staffing ? I would like to know personally or on behalf of Council what does staffing look 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 like at Weston Field? How many lifeguards are they supposed to have? What happens when they don't have them. Do they advertise or are they union. Like, I don't know anything about the employees over there. So, Mr. Voldenberg , could you please ask about the staffing -- the normal staffing at Weston Field and see if this, you know, these requests and these ideas from this resident may be considered ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask tomorrow . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And secondly , a concern ed citizen came to me about Walgreens on South Main Avenue in West Scranton . I want to make you aware that at least for the last two months Walgreens via their hired help routinely clean their parking lot. And by cleaning I mean they use a leaf blower that actually blows the garbage and debris onto the sidewalk s and onto Main Avenue. This occurs every other week. And this is also contributing to the block drains that we hear about all the time when we have these large storms. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 So like I said earlier , concerned citizens sometime s have the best answers for us or solutions because she reminded me that this action that they're doing violates Section 305-4 of Subsection A, litter on sidewalk s. So I thank her for bringing this to my attention . And, Mr. Voldenberg , can you alert code enforcement that this is occurring , let them have a talk with Walgreens that they're, you know, they're actually violating the code, the City code. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. And you know what, that's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. The only thing I have tonight , Mr. Voldenberg , can you check with PA American Water and also DPW regarding the sewer issue on the 1400 block of Rundle? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And also make sure that the petition that Mr. Thomas brought is sent to the appropriate departments for a traffic study. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 it. MR. KING: Mr. Donahue , can I just add I know we mentioned Mr. Lazor's name quite a bit in here. He serves honorably on a number of City boards. And Mr. Schuster mention ed to me that his wife passed away last Wednesday . She was a wonderful woman. I coached her son Billy at Central High School and just a wonderful family. And I just want to send out our condolences to Bill Lazor's family. Her name was Mary Ann Lazor. She passed away last Wednesday and the funeral was on Saturday . So our thoughts and prayers are with the Lazor family. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – APPROVING THE LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA AND LACKAWANNA COLLEGE . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 MR. KING: Second. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , looking at this agreement two questions I have, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could send over to the administration , Lackawanna College had rented Memorial Stadium and the practice field there off the school district . Can we ask if the administration had reached out to tell me to find out what they had paid for the leasing or renting of their field and if it had any impact on the cost that they decided to agree upon for the rental? And also, with that being said, there is a small portion of this that talks about the maintenance of the fields. And I hope that if it's Parks and Recreation that are going to be overseeing their usage of the field, I hope they're going to be keeping a close eye on the maintenance of the field because it doesn't seem that the -- that's really specifically spelled out. So if we could just see how we're going to monitor the maintenance of the field 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 as well as if they reached out to the school district for the price they arrived at. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask both questions . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, we spoke a little bit about this in caucus. And first of all, a thousand dollars is -- that's a great deal for Lackawanna , you know, compared to what the district used to charge. But part of the agreement and it concerns me is, okay, for a thousand dollars you get the field, right, it probably should have been negotiated more. But that's here nor there. But part of the agreement is to maintain the field or to replace or fix any damage that occurs on that field. So we had some resident s come here and had pictures and believe s that maybe that happened . So I want to know within this agreement who is going to provide the assessment when this agreement terminates and make a decision on how they're going to, you know, fix this problem .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Plus we want it brought to our attention too. I would like an update when this agreement is over. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree that we need a plan in place for maintenance of this field if they're going to be using it for the remainder of the year then that needs to take place in the spring time but repairs would be ideal to be made in the spring so that it's useable during the warmer months. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so the thing here is that there's a history of the school using City properties or district properties . And I just want to make sure it's been properly looked into. When we look at the price that the school district paid charged $250 a day and $300 a night for practices . It's a big difference here with the pricing . I'm all for being a good neighbor . And I'm all for renting and leasing a property but just making sure the taxpayers are getting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 the best deal. So, I mean, with that said there's a history here of renting properties . There's a history with the Riverfront also. And if they've looked into these things, would go a long way with making deals and agreements . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? So I would just compare this to just leases we do with other non-profit organizations whether it be little leagues , whether it be the Anthracite Bike Coalition back at Connell Park where we lease land and in turn for leasing that land those organizations maintain , you know, that field. So, you know, I'm fine asking question s about that.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – DESIGNATING BACK-IN ANGLE PARKING FOR CERTAIN BLOCKS OF ST. ANN STREET. MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I'm thrilled and very proud of the St. Ann's residents that created a petition , signed a petition to bring back angled parking. It was always there as long as I could remember . I'm 60 years old. So it predates me. And for whatever reason no one really totally understands , it was taken away from the resident s being stated that there was no ordinance on the books to allow it, which is fine. So a traffic study was done at 90 degree angle a couple years ago, didn't make any sense. And we never got a full traffic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 study or a full report that made sense to the resident s. So the resident s asked for another one. They said, you know, how about a 30 degree angle which is more realistic how cars really park there with probably the widest street in the county. And that was conduct ed in a professional manner. We got pictures of it. You could see it was done very well. And they came to the conclusion that it's allowable . So I'm very happy for the resident s that came forward and really pushed this to happen. So I'm definitely supporting this and voting yes. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? Solicitor Gallagher , just to make sure we're doing this right, will you make sure that -- double-check and see if we have to have a public hearing for this or not? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Sure. MR.

MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final vote on Item 7-H. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'd like to make a motion to table Item 7-H. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the table and a second to table Item 7-H. On 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : So on the question , looking at this document , I think it needs to be cleaned up a little bit before it's sent to Council . There's a couple -- there's a couple mistakes , maybe looks like copy and paste errors. When we're looking at the legislation itself, it stated it's for demolition engineering service s not roof and masonry repairs. So I think on that legislation that needs to be taken a look at. On page four it states that -- on the top of the page it states that it's for roof and mason repairs. But then as you get into the backup it states that it's for the East Mountain Flood and Stormwater Project . So I'm not sure what happened there. In addition to that on page 132 of the backup documentation , it seems that there was a telecommunications meeting that occurred where some of the scope of the work had been changed . So when we're looking at initial bids, this bidder does appear to be the lowest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 bidder. However , there is a $20,000 change in the scope of the work. That takes them out of being the lowest bidder. So I think we're going to need some information on this before it continues . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of tabling Item 7-H signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.
