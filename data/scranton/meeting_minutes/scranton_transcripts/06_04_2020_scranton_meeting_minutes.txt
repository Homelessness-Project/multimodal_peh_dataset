MR. GAUGHAN : I'd ask that everyone remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community . Let us take a special moment of silence tonight for people in our community throughout the world who are suffering or who have passed away from the coronavirus . Let us think about them and their families at this time that they may find peace. Let us think now about the doctors , the nurses, the researchers and all medical professionals and first responders who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process , may they find protection and peace. Whether we are here at home or abroad, surround ed by many people suffering from this illness or only a few, let us stick together , endure together , mourn together , persist and prepare together . And in place of our anxiety , let us continue to hope and to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 find peace. Thank you. Miss Carrera , roll call, please. MS.

SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED COMPARISON REPORT 2019-2020 YEAR TO DATE MAY 31, 2020. 3-C. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM JESSICA ESKRA, ESQUIRE , DATED MAY 22, 2020 REGARDING CONTRACT BETWEEN NORTHEAST REVENUE SERVICE , LLC AND THE CITY OF SCRANTON . 3-D. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM DONALD J. FREDERICKSON , JR., ESQUIRE , GENERAL COUNSEL FOR LACKAWANNA COUNTY, DATED MAY 19, 2020 REGARDING SCRANTON POLLING PLACES 2-1 AND 12-3. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? I just have one comment . On the Single Tax Office report that we received , I was in contact with the Tax Collector , Mr. Fox. There was a typographical error. They did fix that. So we will be getting the amended report. And it will be on our agenda for next week. The error had to do with the third column in the total -- or the second column rather. So all of the numbers when they were added up they were -- the numbers were off. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 So they had fixed that. It should be 27 million dollars -some odd dollars . So that will be amended . And we'll have that in Third Order next week. Anyone else -- comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I think -- well, I had some comment s on some other things, but I think we covered them in caucus regarding Northeast Revenue . But, yeah, in regard to the Single Tax Office piece, I guess when we take a look at this -- and maybe this is something Mayor Cognetti can touch on when she talks in public comment . But the 2019 to 2020 differences , are we chalking that up to strictly COVID as the reason for the difference in revenues ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah. So -- yeah, I'll let Mayor Cognetti wants to touch on that in Fourth Order. And I do know that I had asked the Mayor to have Mr. Sheridan come, but obviously he could not tonight . But that was the plan for him to kind of touch on the Single Tax Office report. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, it's a possibility . It may be or it may not. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else on the Third Order items? Okay. If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I do. I have two. The Salvation Army on South Washington Avenue is giving away food boxes. So in order to get them, you have to call them at 570-969-6399. You have to provide your last name, the last four digits of your Social Security and the number of people in your family. When you do that, you will get an appointment that day or the next day as when you could come and pick up the food. And the food, there's quite a bit of it, I guess. They'll have a box of meat, a box of canned goods, a boxes of dry goods, you know, starches , rice, pasta, fresh fruits and fresh vegetable s. So my understanding is they still have quite a bit of this. I think people should take advantage of this. And also, this Sunday, June 7th at St. Lucy's parish in West Side, they are hosting something called a Heat and Eat 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Drivethrough Only, which is they said it's a spaghetti bowl giveaway from 1 p.m. until they are out of product . That's all I have. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Anyone else have any announcement s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have two. First off, there is the Arc of Northeast Pennsylvania . They are having a little parade over at Nay Aug Park. It's going to be Tuesday , June 16th. So it's not for another week and a half or so. But it's going to be June 16th at 6 p.m. And usually their clients will have a bowling banquet . They serve clients with disabilitie s. And so they are adult clients that participate in bowling throughout the year. They usually have a banquet around this time. And they are all really disappoint ed that that banquet is cancelled . And so in order to show support , they're going to be at the park with trophies and awards. And so they are asking that if people are interested in attending , it's going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 to be like a parade with vehicles . So the vehicles can line up around 5:30 to drive past the clients of the Arc that will be there. So I think that will be a really nice way to celebrate with them and to show support for them. And then the other announcement that I had, I just wanted to wish everyone a happy Pride Month. City Hall raised the Pride flag for the third year now. And I'm really proud that we've been able to do that and we continue to do that. For whose those who don't know, Pride Month has started in commemoration of the Stonewall riots that happened in 1969. And last year I think was the 50th year celebration of Pride Month and the Pride parade. And a lot of those celebrations we can't have this year. But it's still really important that we recognize this month that's so important to the LGBTQ community that continues to fight for equality . And they come a long way, but there's still a lot more work to do. So I just wanted to as I said wish everyone a happy Pride 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Month. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. I'd like to ask if somebody would please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individual s, Marie Schumacher , Fay Franus and Patricia Nestor. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll make a motion to accept. MS. REED: Excuse me. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion. Is there a second? MS. REED: Councilman Gaughan ? Councilman Gaughan , I did send a late e-mail, I apologize . There was a fourth person who did. I was able to confirm that she does reside in the City. So we can add her name. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. What was her name, Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Her name was Simone Daniel. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Okay, so we'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 add Simone Daniel's into the official record as well. Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Okay. There's been a motion made. Was there a second? I'm sorry. MR. MCANDREW : I'll second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , just a few things. So we received comments from Miss Schumacher , Mrs. Franus, and Patricia Nestor. Several of Miss Schumacher 's questions about the agenda items would be answered by the program guidance that the Mayor provided . We'll put that in Third Order next week. And it will be, I'm sure, on the website. And the public will be able to view that. That should take care of most of the questions here. The one question from Mrs. Nestor, the Mayor declared that the City pools would not be open this summer. Can the Council override her and open the pools? Why wasn't this is a joint decision ? Who on Council is for or against opening the pools. I want this on record for the next election . I can answer that question . No, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Council cannot override the Mayor on that decision . That decision is up to the Mayor and the Recreation Authority . And that decision was made -- and maybe the Mayor can speak to this is in Fourth Order. But there's a pandemic going on where you're suppose d to be social distancing . So it would not make any sense to have, you know, dozens and dozens of children swimming around next to each other in a pool. So I don't think it was -- you know, it was a decision really that was made by the CDC and the Pennsylvania Department of Health. It's not who's for or against opening pools. I'm sure everybody wants to open the pools. But we also don't want young people and anyone for that matter to get the coronavirus . Does anybody else have comments on the motion? Okay. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. And, Mayor, I'll turn it over to you now if you want to continue where we left off. MAYOR COGNETTI : Sure. Thank you all for having me again this evening . So I can address a couple of those things that just came up on the public comment . So on the pools, this is not a decision that the administration takes lightly at all. I -- it's not something that we want to do by any stretch of the imagination . But we do find ourselves in this position as we have been for these past months where in order to make sure that we're keeping our community safe and providing a safe environment where our kids are able to be socially distant -- the families that come with those kids are able to be socially distant . You know, we think about a pool, it's not just being in the water. I know I get I'm sure you all get some comment s too, well, they determined it's safe to be in a pool. You can't transmit the virus through the pool water. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 That's not the issue here. The issue is, is the environment around the pool where you have people -- a lot of people. Our pools are wonderful . And they get so many people every day. It would be very, very difficult , really impossible for us to make sure that everybody is maintaining social distancing standards , making sure that we're sanitizing all of the bathrooms constantly in order to keep everyone safe. It's the same with the play equipment . I hate that we have the yellow tape around the play equipment . I want to rip it off myself. But we have new sanitation equipment that we're able to get. We'll get reimbursed for that with FEMA money. And we'll be cleaning and sanitizing that as much as we can in the future. But we cannot -- we cannot open those things right now because we won't be able to keep up with that. And we don't want to put our families in Scranton in a dangerous position . So it's not fun. And I'm sorry that we had to make this decision . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 If there's a way for us to move forward and open the pools at some point this -- we are continuing to look at that. I certain ly would love to be able to do that. If there's a way for us to do that, that makes sense for the City as we go from yellow phase tomorrow into green phase. And as we look at our operations , if there's a way for us to open some of the pools we will try. But we want to manage expectations . And at this point, those expectations , you know, we need to set them based on the pandemic that we are facing right now. While we're on the subject of parks, I want to let you all know, I'm sure you've heard that on Sunday we had -- the City had yet another fatality at the Nay Aug gorge. We had already been having meetings -- Zoom meetings about the gorge and what we can do to deter people from going up there from jumping , from swimming . So we had -- we already had signs. We already had fines for that. What we've done in the past week is we've added cameras . There are now three cameras up there that the SPD are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 monitoring . And they've already in these past couple of days been able to take that -- get that information and send a patrol car up there to ask people to leave. So the cameras are there. We added more signage this week that's more -- even more specific . And we are thinking about the possibility of increasing the fine for swimming in the gorge. It's something that we can all discuss . And I'm open -- we are very open to any ideas that you on Council or you in the community have for how we can further deter people from going up to the gorge. And we all know all too well how that ends sometimes . So that's the update on that. I appreciate my administration acting so quickly to get those cameras up. That was -- that was tremendous . On the Single Tax Office question , Mr. Schuster , the discrepancy that you would see from 2019 into 2020, we definitely -- we definitely know that the pandemic is a huge piece of that, the closures of businesses , the closures of organizations , the layoffs that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 have hit everyone in every sector definitely will have an impact on those tax collections . So we continue to monitor all of those pieces. And Pat Sheridan our Business Administrator is going to be at the caucus on Tuesday to further go through that with you. He wasn't able to join tonight for family reasons . So to take that to the next Business Administrator topic, I let you know via memo today that we have a new Business Administrator , Carl Deeley who began the job on Monday. Pat Sheridan and Carl Deeley have generously offered to share the position for the month of June. So they are splitting the salary and benefits . It's no extra cost to the City. They are splitting those down the middle. And I'm very grateful for their generosity and (audio interruption .) MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, Mayor, I think you muted. You're muted by accident . MAYOR COGNETTI : Sorry. MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. MAYOR COGNETTI : Did I leave -- did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 I talk about Carl and Pat sharing the job? MR. GAUGHAN : I think you just got cut off when that started . MAYOR COGNETTI : Okay. So Mr. Deeley started on Monday. And Mr. Sheridan is still with us this month. And they are sharing the role, which is tremendous . So it's split -- split the salary, split the benefits . It's not an extra cost to the City. We're able to get this transition where, you know, Mr. Sheridan 's working -- been working on a slew of things. And Mr. Deeley is coming in. And they'll probably be working together for the month to be able to make that warm handoff, which is very, very, very helpful for a lot of reasons . So we haven't said good-bye to Mr. Sheridan yet. So we'll do that at some point. And hopefully we might be able to find a way to still be able to get his guidance . As we look at these tax issues, for example , some of the audit processes are something that Mr. Sheridan 's been working on and looking at the Treasury Department and see how it can work 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 better. So back to what we talked about on the caucus, how do we collect taxes? How do we go over the delinquent taxes? This is kind of Mr. Sheridan 's bread and butter. So we might be coming to you with a proposal of how to essentially keep working with him in some manner but not as a full-time employee . You'll see Mr. Deeley's appointment letter I believe on your June 16th agenda. But I included his bio in that memo to you all. We also have another attorney that's joined us, Mr. Joe O'Brien is now on the team in the legal department . We're very, very grateful for his -- him signing on to help the City. He has a very strong background in public sector law and will be a great asset to all of us. The other pieces that I just wanted to touch on, so, you know, we -- the issues that are going across the country right now we sent to you -- it was late this afternoon . But I wanted to make sure I got it to you before this. I sent you a letter cosigned by Chief Graziano and myself that goes through -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 restates what we've said before what the Chief has said that we at the City have a responsibility to create an environment where all of our City feels safe (inaudible ) feel safe, also safe to express their views. So we welcome people to rally and make their voices heard. And we have a responsibility to listen. So I'm very privileged -- we all are very privileged that Chief Graziano has been the Police Chief in Scranton for so many years because he is already -- already employs progressive policies , implements progressive training . And detailed -- he detailed for us many of these things in this document that I sent you. You're welcome to share this with citizens that reach out to you. And we'll be doing the same from here at the City. So some of the things that it details are -- there's a new advocacy movement called Eight Can't Wait. So it's eight policy reforms that people are asking people to ask their Mayors and their police chiefs to address . So we specifically go through each 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 of the eight. And essentially the Scranton Police Department in its policies already has elements of all eight there. And you could -- you could see there how we -- how we are address -- well, how we -- the Chief already has addressed these things. But we can certainly improve upon them. We're -- would absolutely , you know, we will look at these. There is a policy review committee at the police department that continues -- continually looks at policy. And he and I will continue to work on listening and seeing what we can do better. But we're so fortunate -- and to Council members Gaughan and Donahue who were I think on Council when the police officers got the body cams, that's a huge piece of what we can be really proud of in Scranton . They're really the proactive steps that the police department has taken to have transparency in the police department . And you'll see in there, you know, there's a duty to intervene policy. There's de-escalation training, incident review. The police policies prohibit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 any use of neck restraints as we all unfortunately have seen that video from Minneapolis last week. So please go through that. I'm sure the Chief would be happy to go through it in more detail and the time. But I wanted to make sure to get that to you all tonight as (inaudible ) as you get questions . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mayor. Does anybody have any questions for Mayor Cognetti ? Mayor, I just have one. It's a little off topic. But Councilman Donahue and I have been talking about this. And I know Councilman Donahue had asked previously , can you give us any update on the paving project for this year? I know that's on everybody 's mind throughout the City. MAYOR COGNETTI : Yes. So I -- the RFP was suppose d to go out today. MR. GAUGHAN : Great. Thank you so much. That's good news. MR. DONAHUE : That's the RFP for the engineering , correct ? MAYOR COGNETTI : I believe so. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MR. DONAHUE : I believe the -- yeah, because the engineering has to go out first, I believe . And then you put out for the actual paving I believe is the process there. MAYOR COGNETTI : Yeah, that's -- I believe so. I don't have it right in front of me. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. MAYOR COGNETTI : Yeah. MR. DONAHUE : And I was going to -- I was also going to mention Nay Aug, the gorge. So I'm happy that, you know, there's already steps being taken. And, you know, I'll be reaching out too just with a couple other suggestions . MAYOR COGNETTI : Yeah, please, really because it's one of these things that we, you know, just -- you can't -- you can't ever guarantee these things. But anything that we can do, let's do it. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I mean, there's been a problem up there for, you know, generations . So it's just, you know, continuing to adapt. MAYOR COGNETTI : Right, yeah, any -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 please, any suggestions are welcome . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else have any questions for the Mayor? Mayor, we always appreciate you taking the time out of your busy life and being the Mayor and everything else that you have going on. So we really appreciate it and appreciate you coming and answering our questions and being transparent, you know, with your administration . So we appreciate it very much. Thank you. MAYOR COGNETTI : Thank you. Thanks all very much. And tomorrow , yellow phase, we'll get -- we'll keep getting that guidance out as much as we can. As I said in the caucus, we're hoping to launch that new site very, very soon to be able to have members , especial ly business owners and organization owners who are opening their doors for the first time in the next days and weeks, get you -- get you more specific resources , make sure that you know what you need to do to be able to reopen. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Have a good night, Mayor. Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. (Public comment letters submitted to Council ) (Marie Schumacher ) First, a few comments : - I am very disappointed that the City denied use of a Municipal Building (Engine 10 Fire Station ) after the County had published the final listing and then did not have the decency to send letters to the affected registered voters. - I would like to know why calls made to department (s) at City Hall were (a) not answered and message boxes were saturated . I would think someone should have been responsible for taking messages and keeping the message box clear. O Moving on to Agenda Items: 5B I question this Item both for safety and equality reasons . This would seem feasible primarily in the downtown area where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the distance between curb and structure is deeper than in the rest of the City. There are many downtown residents who are elderly and need to use walking aids which could become a safety issue if walking space is reduced to the minimum five feet. 5C & 5D There are contractual documents provided but I could find no application which should be a public document with justification . Also for fairness , there should be a cut off date for submittal of applications so they may be prioritized by need should the available funding be expired . 5E I am a firm believer that best decisions are made by those who will have to abide by/be affected the action(s) of the decision maker. While I know Council will rubber stamp this I think this employee should at minimum be required to pay both EIT and LST since property taxes will automatically be nullified . Moving on to General Issues which I will limit until next week when I trust we will be back in the Municipal Building : - Please explain what differentiate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 the Treasurer 's Sale from the County Property Sales. (Fay Franus) Council , Perhaps you have heard this statement during these protest across the country . It pretty much sums up how I feel about our city government . " I AM SICK AND TIRED OF BEING SICK AND TIRES." I want to address yet again and again what are you as council members and the Mayor doing for the people in regards to the garbage fee? I say this because many of these delinquent fee properties have liens placed on their homes. That does NOT help the 75% of us who are paying for those who do not pay!!!!! Many many of these properties will not have to deal with these liens for maybe forty years, twenty years--when they move or die-- so putting liens is not helping any of us who pay. I want to know when are you going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 do something to go after these people OTHER THAN LIENS? You know you have a city law stating the DPW does NOT have to pick up anyone's garbage if their fee is not paid/ Also a law saying all cans must have lids on them thus no bags to cause a health hazard, BUT you do nothing -not only do you do nothing you should be screaming at the tip of your lungs about the mayor allowing Courtright 's collection agency to continue to collect the fees until Dec 31 2020. The Mayor has had plenty of time to seek out other avenues to get these fees paid--NOTHING was done! Those people should be arrested for paying bribes--oh no-- what do we do in Scranton --we reward them by allowing them to continue working for us. Disgraceful . When Bill Courtright never responded to Bill Gaughan 's questions he mentioned it every week-- NOT NOW! No mention of answers not being given to council by Paige Cognetti and God knows Marie Schumacher has asked many important questions . Many are working from home BUT they are still working --so where are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 the answer? They are all getting full pay--but for what I ask? Jessica Eskra even has $10,000 more in her paycheck that Mayor Evans gave her that YOU allowed her to keep in the budget even though she doesn't do HR work anymore --which was the reason she got that nice raise. While people are losing their homes to high taxes--but you must take care of your crony workers while we suffer. Are you proud you allowed these raises Mayor Evans gave out to continue ? Which were many. You did it! Own it! When are you going to hold the Mayor's feet to the fire? When? Ever? Listen to me here next year do not even consider doing what Mayor Evans tried to do-- put fees in the property taxes--meaning the way he was going to do it--he wanted landlords to only pay for one apartment and all the others do not have to pay the $300 fee-- that would be thousands and thousands of dollars the city would be not getting , when they surely could. Every apartment MUST pay their $300 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 fee --each and every one--NOT just one. That is a kick in the teeth yet again for those of us who do pay. Still waiting for answers to my questions -- one being is the garbage fee money coming in paying city bills as well versus just DPW expenses ? Do you even know? Have you checked ? That is what was going on for years. You need to know if the money is being separated and I want to know. SOON! Why don't you take these people to court somehow -- there has to be a way not just liens. We are fed up. When will you work for us? We pay you to -- My neighbor owes $4193.83 in delinquent garbage fees I've sent you photos of what she puts out every week--here is last weeks-- she also added a gas grill after this photo was taken. And it fell all over my sidewalk . I had to pick it up and move it back-- this is last weeks garbage --Tawanda Ballard 325 Railroad Avenue. (Picture was attached .) Please find a way to go after individual properties who never pay their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 garbage bills for years! Six in my block alone. How many times do I need to address this -it is YEARS NOW YEARS and nothing is done LIENS do NOT help us or the city. Stop picking up their garbage you have the law behind you Enforce it! Fay Franus. (Patricia Nestor) The mayor declared that the city pools would not open this summer. Can the council override her and open the pools? Why wasn't this a joint decision ? Who on council is for or against opening the pools? I want this on record for the next election . Also, it’s National Scoliosis Awareness Month. What is being done to bring awareness of this disease ? An early diagnosis gives the patient more treatment options . Patricia Nestor (Simone Daniel) My name is Simone Daniel and I ask 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 this question on behalf of myself and several members of my family. A few members of the state legislature including House Democratic whip Jordan Harris, chairwoman Joanna McClinton and many others, released plans yesterday for wide reaching police reform in the state. In their plan they outline the need for a review board. The outline requires ballot initiatives or for City Councils to “create and improve an independent , well-financed civilian led and managed review board with subpoena and disciplinary powers to recommend internal affairs and criminal investigations per the negotiated disciplinary code”. It also says to “Establish public comment hearings pre-negotiation regarding the police contract ”. Will the Scranton City Council take the necessary steps, in accordance with the state government to impose reform on policing and the justice system in our city. Thank You. (End of Public Comment )1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, Mrs. Reed. Fifth Order. MS. REED: Thank you. FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, not at this time. I think actually in the previous portions of the meeting , all of the things have been -- have been addressed . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much, Councilman Schuster . Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, just a couple. So two concerned citizens -- I already forwarded these questions to Mrs. Reed. And they just asked a couple questions . One was how many tickets have been given out for texting while driving . So please, Miss Reed, send that forward . And also another citizen came to me and is concerned or wants to know how does one get a speed bump study started . So, Mrs. Reed, if you could also pass that along and to see how we do that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 I want to touch a little bit on what Mayor Cognetti just said with regards to that act Eight Can't Wait. So I know that I receive d a few e-mails. I know that fellow council members received some e-mails. And it's regarding the, you know, police violence . And it contained a link to the website called Eight Can't Wait that recommends , you know, eight policy reforms to protect black citizens . So I also had the opportunity to speak and converse with Chief Graziano . And I'm happy and proud to say that we pretty much satisfy all eight. And I'm just going to touch on them real quick because I asked him to send items to me in bullet form. So banning chokeholds and strangleholds , already a policy. Require de-escalation , already a policy. There's ongoing and continuous training for this. Require warning before shooting . Our policy states all possible officers shall first give a verbal warning . Exhaust all other means before shooting . This is already a policy, okay. Duty to intervene , this is inherent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 as in a crime is not to stop or report excessive force, our officers will be held criminally liable. So, you know, this is a policy that's in place. Ban shooting of a vehicle . Police can't completely ban shooting of vehicle s. And, you know, I don't want to go through the whole thing. But an instance is, you know, if police are being shot at from a vehicle , of course, they could shoot at a vehicle . All right. Require use of force continuum . This is also a policy and require comprehensive reporting . This is already a policy. So I'm glad to say again, that we're already satisfying the, you know, the Eight Can't Wait initiatives . So I know we should share that with a few people that reached out to us. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much for that, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comment s at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a couple of comments . First off, I'd like to comment on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 two of our pieces of legislation tonight , 5-C and 5-D. I mentioned these things in caucus. But I just wanted to bring them up during the meeting that I'm really happy that we were able to find these funds to be able to utilize for small business grants and loans at this time. I know that businesses are really hurting , especially your small businesses . I would hate to see more businesses close result of this pandemic . And I believe these funds are going to be really helpful on getting some businesses back up on their feet, help them to purchase PPE. And perhaps I know that some businesses have not qualified for the plans that are out there. Maybe they've had too little employees or for whatever reason and so they might then be appropriate and qualify for the ones that we would be offering now. So I want to thank OECD and its new Director Miss Cipriani for getting creative with our funds. That's what we need more of quite frankly to find ways to help out businesses , to help out our community with what we have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 So the next thing that I wanted to address , I just wanted to mention a few things with regards to what's going on in our country right now and to just address racism and police brutality I feel like has not been addressed enough. And obviously we do not have any people of color here on our council or on (inaudible .) But I would like to think that I could help be a voice for people and that I can be here to support the black and brown community and whatever their needs are. I did attend the protest that happened downtown last weekend . I think I was the only elected official there. I'm really happy to say that it was very peaceful and respectful . I'm really proud of our city and that, you know, there has not been problems like looting or rioting that we've seen in a lot of other cities throughout our country right now. So I just think -- feel like I need to say that black lives matter and that we see you. And we need to be doing more. For far too long black people have been treated less 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 than. And it's about time that they become equal like the rest of us. So we have a problem with systemic institution alized racism in our country . We're not immune to this in our city. It happens everywhere . And I want to make sure that we do everything possible to prevent what happened to George Floyd and to many others from happening here in Scranton . So I appreciate that many of us have already been on top of addressing the many e-mails that we received from citizens . I've had a lot of conversations with people about what can be done here in our City to take steps to address these issues and thank you to Mark for explain -- or Councilman McAndrew for explaining the things that Chief Graziano sent over. I have the utmost respect for Chief Graziano and our police department . And I know that they have really done a good job of already adding to the policies that they have. I believe that we always can do better. And I'm interested at looking at ways that we can do that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 One of the suggestions that we've had from a few citizens has been to have a citizens review board, which we don't have in Scranton . I'm not really sure how many cities in Pennsylvania do if they're larger cities or the effectiveness to those boards. But I'm certainly interested in exploring that as a possible option. I would be concerned about funding, of course, for something of that nature. But, you know, I would be happy to have suggestions and I'll certainly do more research on those review boards to see if that's something that we need. In the meantime , continue to provide us with your input and what you feel like the black and brown community needs. And I'm here to listen. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just briefly . First, I would like to thank Fire Chief Lucas's quick response to my inquiries last week regarding the Emergency Management Plan and also the way that they're dealing with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 firehouses . I haven't gotten -- there was a lot of document s that came through . So I haven't gotten completely through them. So I'll touch more on that at our next meeting on Tuesday . So I just want to thank him for his quick reply to those inquiries . Just a couple requests I have for this week. The blue bin recycling , it's still being collected as recycling but is unfortunately being taken up to the landfill . And the reason we got to that about two months ago was not knowing how COVID-19 would -- how long it stays on surfaces and with concerns with the spread happening there, so would we be able, Miss Reed, would we be able to send a request to the county to see where we're at and what the plan is for restarting bringing blue bin recycling back to the Recycling Center? And also, I would like to request for the administration an update on all the issues involving the 700 block of Wyoming Avenue. I believe there's a couple different lawsuits over there involving , you know, Mr. Young and Kennedy . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 There's a couple other families now involved in that so just to see if we can get an update on the whole situation over there. And I also talked to the City Engineer John Pocius today about some of the issues in Keyser Valley with the flooding . He did say that the previous administration had put together bid specs for a hydraulic study to be performed . In looking at some of the options over there, they came across some grant funding that's available . But the grant funding is only available if you already have a project on the shelf ready to go. So the first part to getting to that point to be even be able to apply for the grant is to do this legwork up front. So would we be able to also ask the administration because it's my understanding that it's all ready to go. It just needs to be sent out to do this hydraulic study. And that would basically just determine how the water flows, how you get the water to the pump station and how much volume the pump station could handle then going out. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 And then I do also have a meeting scheduled with the new DPW Director to go over some initiatives . So hopefully I could update everyone at the next meeting regarding that. That's all I have for Fifth Order tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I just have two things. First, I want to just state that I agree with Councilman Donahue I'd also like an update on the Meadow Brook Creek Project in the 700 block of Wyoming Avenue. That's been an issue now for the last few years. And I know Al Young and his family are affected . And there's several other families affected by that. And that's just not an issue that is gone away even though it has not been discussed here in a little while because it's in litigation . But it would be good for us to get an update on the overall project . I also want to thank the Mayor and Miss Cipriani for coming to our caucus tonight . I do just want to note that I think it's good that we're in a pattern now that these are regular occurrences where in the past, you know, we may see someone from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 administration once, you know, it was like once every few years. Now any time I've requested the Mayor come to caucus with one of her cabinet members , they have always had no problem doing that. So I do want to thank them for that. Again, since I've been on Council I thought that should just be a regular occurrence . So I'm glad to see that when Council has questions and we ask them to come, they do show up and they do answer questions . And the last thing that I wanted to say was that the Mayor touched on this a little bit. But we are moving to the yellow phase in Lackawanna County. You know, I've seen a lot of things on social media about moving to the yellow phase. I just want to remind people that this doesn't mean that the coronavirus has magically disappeared . It's still here. It is still spreading although at a much slower rate. There were 13 new cases today in Lackawanna County. But my message is that we still need to remain vigilant and continue to practice social distancing when possible and wear masks.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 It does not make any sense to give up at this point and just think that, you know, this virus has gone away or that because we're in the yellow phase we can just go out and do whatever we want. I think it is important for our economy to start opening back up. And that is going to happen. I think some of the things on our agenda tonight will help the small businesses and will help that along. But I don't think we can, you know, just give up at this point in terms of some of the measures that we've taken over the last few months. So I would ask people, you know, not to be selfish , to wear masks in public to follow those guidelines as we have been and think of other people when you're out and about as we move into the yellow phase. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.

GAUGHAN : Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just want to say two things, number one, we're all aware that the pandemic has had really a devastating affect on our citizens and on our economy . We need to do everything that we can as elected official s and as a city to help our citizens and to help our economy and our businesses . I'm hoping that this piece and 5-D's will be a shot in the arm to our local economy . We live in very challenging times. But we can't let them define who we are. We need to continue to be creative and come up with solutions to the problems we face. And this is really a great first step in that. And I was pleased to hear from Miss 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 Cipriani tonight on some of the ideas even moving forward with the loan program because I think that, you know, this is the first step. But we're going to need to do other things in moving forward as the economy continue s to change and the pandemic continues to progress and hopefully at some point goes away. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ?

SCHUSTER : On the question . I'm sorry about that. MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. MR. SCHUSTER : This is something I should have asked in caucus while we had Mrs. Cipriani and the Mayor on -- did they work with like some of the local business es to define the $2,500? Do we know that? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, that's a good question . I don't know the exact answer to that. But I'm pretty sure that the reason that they did that was to kind of -- with the money that they had to spread it out to as many businesses as possible . That's my guess, Tom, but I don't know for sure. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I know in the county, I mean, there was a large influx of people that were applying for those. And they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 went fast. I'm sure the same thing here. I'm wondering if they don't go as fast as the county if there's something left over, larger grants could be awarded. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, that's a good idea. DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, President Gaughan , you're correct . They did want to spread it out so that they could give as much as they could to -- businesses as they could. I believe it's the amount for 110 businesse s. You know, it might be -- I'm sure it's something that they can revise if for some reason it doesn't go as quickly . Yeah, I would think with the immense need right now that it -- that will be used up pretty quickly . MR. SCHUSTER : So that was part of the discussion -- the initial discussion . MR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO WAIVE THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR EILEEN CIPRIANI IN HER CAPACITY AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON SUBJECT TO CERTAIN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 CONDITIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Somebody 's got to say -- MR. SCHUSTER : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : I did second. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And then Councilman McAndrew gave a second. On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I have something on the question . All right. So my vote for this will be one of principle . This is not personal or political as I've been accused. I voted yes to appoint Mrs. Cipriani because of her qualifications which are not in question . So my first reason is the City actually has a policy that states employees must reside in the City. So that's number one. Number two, I've always been about being fair and equitable for all, okay? Number three, I live here. And I have to look in the eyes of a hundred plus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 firefighter s, a hundred plus police officers , almost a hundred DPW workers and 40 plus furlough ed clerks that just lost their benefits with uncertainty of even getting their jobs back. They have to live here. They pay taxes here. They have skin in the game. I know the Mayor, a couple colleagues on Council , and a few others that disagree with me. And that's okay. I mean, my wife and I have disagreements every day and we're still married for 32 years. So when on School Board and on Council , I've always owned my vote. And at the end of the day I have to live with my vote. I could live with this one. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : I would also just -- I agree with, you know, everything Mr. McAndrew said. But it's about fairness and equity. And no matter if you're the employee at the bottom end of the pay scale or the top end of the pay scale, we should all be treated the same way. We should all follow the same rules. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 That's not to say that I don't think that, you know, a waiver shouldn 't be used in any way. I would (audio interrupted .) MR. GAUGHAN : I think we lost you, Kyle. Can anyone else hear Kyle? ATTY. HAYES: No. MR. GAUGHAN : You're still breaking up a little bit. MR. DONAHUE : How about now? You got me now? MR. GAUGHAN : Yep. Now I can hear you better. MR. DONAHUE : Just I think it's about fairness and equity and whether at the top end of the pay scale or the bottom end of the pay scale everyone should be treated equally (audio interrupted .) MR. GAUGHAN : Now you're frozen and muted, Kyle. We'll give him a minute to unfreeze himself . It's happened to the best of us so I understand . Okay, while Kyle is coming back to us, does anyone else want to add onto the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so on the question , according to City Code what it stated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 with this waiver was that what was best for the City. And at that time we did have a little bit of negotiations there that some of the stipulation s that we had weren't met. So although it was unconditional the way that we negotiated , I think in the end we realize d that communication helps with things like this. So there were a lot of criticisms that came out there. But I think what occurred with this waiver ended up being the best for the City. So I think that is by the code. So I do think it was a better deal for the City. And I do think it's fair that Mrs, Cipriani will -- although not living in the City pay what every other citizen pays. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? The only thing I want to add is just a few things. First of all, I understand both sides of the argument here. I just kind of want to reiterate what I said two or three weeks ago. It does say in the Home Rule Charter that it shall be within the sole discretion of the Mayor in evaluating the circumstances of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 each candidate for employment to determine whether or not to seek a waiver of the residency requirements contain herein. So the Mayor does have that right if she, you know, deems that person to be qualified and to be in the best interest of the City that that person then would or she would submit a waiver to Council . I agree with my colleagues that in a perfect world, I would like to see everyone that works for the City live in the City. As I mention ed two or three weeks ago, we're in the midst of a pandemic that has rocked the United States. It's rocked the world. And it has totally thrown our economy into a complete upheaval of epic proportions by anyone's account . We -- as I mentioned two weeks ago, we may be entering into one of the worst recessions since the great depression in the 1930s. So as Councilman Schuster said, what I have to balance as a Councilman is what -- literally is what is best for the City. And I do think that Miss Cipriani is the best person at this time for the City to take that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 position . If anyone watched the caucus tonight who's out there watching this meeting , you saw that Miss Cipriani , number one, came prepared ; and number two, basically paid for herself and some with the money that she found lying in an account that was there since 1999. Now we have 500 and -- a half a million dollar loan and grant program that is going to be on its way as soon as we pass it in Seventh Order tonight . I think that's important to note. Our small businesses need help. Our citizens need help. So I think at this point you really -- and my vote is just because I think you have to do what's right for the City. The other thing I want to point out too is qualifications -wise, she has a master's degree in organizational management, a degree in leadership development and project management . She's the former Deputy Secretary for Workforce Development for the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry . She was the Director of the State Workers Insurance Fund and the special 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 assistan t for strategic initiatives in the Department of Labor and Industry . So I think that most citizens would say, jeez, do I want this person to be in charge of the federal programs and the federal -- the millions of dollars that come in from the federal government and how they're going to be spent? And do I want somebody that has this kind of background to be in charge of that? I would hope that people would say yes. Again, I understand the other argument . You know, I really do. But in this -- this is such a unique situation that we find ourselves in that I feel we would be doing the City a disservice , you know, not to try to push this -- pass this through . So again, I'll be voting yes. And, Kyle, I'm sorry. You froze on us. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I apologize . MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. I don't know if you want to finish your comments . MR. DONAHUE : Where -- I mean, do you know where I left off? MR. GAUGHAN : I can't remember . We heard most of it. But -- MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, and just to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 reiterate , you know, this has nothing to do with the qualifications . But we also have 75,000 people in this City. The fact that we're saying that we can't find one that lives in the City that's qualified to take this job, I just -- I'll take those odds any day. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I understand what you're saying. The only thing is I would bet -- I'm not a betting man. But I would bet that it would be very hard to find someone who has a master's degree in organizational management , who was the former Deputy Secretary for Workforce Development for the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry . It just -- all these things add up. And to me when you put that in front and you say, hey, we're in the middle of a pandemic , we're in the middle of the worst economic recession at least since the 1930s, that's what is swaying my decision . But I do understand the other side of it. So anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I don't want to stay silent. I know I made several comments on this over the weeks. But, of course, I echo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 President Gaughan 's comments regarding her qualifications and the situation that we're in during this pandemic and how it's unique. I know that some of our fellow Council members had expressed that they didn't feel that it was justified . But I don't really understand what circumstances would then justify a waiver because I feel like this completely does. I also just personally , you know, feel that this code -- this piece of the code is antiquated , something that's not used in a lot of cities. And while I do agree that I think our employees should be from this City, you know, I was very impressed with the qualifications she had. And it just doesn't make sense to me as to why we would vote for the appointment and then vote against the waiver. So do we expect in six months to change the OECD Director and have turnover in that office? I don't think that that is really a healthy decision for our City either. So I am still supportive of this piece of legislation . I appreciate the changes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 that have been made to it and the items that Miss Cipriani has now agreed to. And I'll be voting yes on it tonight . So that was all that I wanted to say. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I just -- Bill, sorry, if I could add because I think when I got off before I was explaining too, you know, the circumstances in which I would consider a waiver. And that's I believe the waiver system should be used as an extension to the six months. So if you have every intention to move into the City within six months but then, you know, any sort of circumstance s that go with buying, selling homes and relocating your family and whatnot , you know, should be taken into consideration to give some sort of extension . But I don't think that extension should ever exceed, you know, another six months. And I think that's -- I just want to clarify that because I think I got cut off when I was mentioning that before. MR. SCHUSTER : I would also like to add to that. When looking at this, I mean, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 salary isn't astronomical . So I could understand maybe a possibility of not moving. And because it's a department head within a Mayor's cabinet, I mean, the possibility that this -- the tenure could only last two years is something that I took into consideration . If we take a city like New York City, which I would say is one of the more progressive cities in the country , if you could get a job in that city, you do have to move into the city. And I think you have to stay there for two to three years before you're allowed to move into like an adjacent county. So to say that this is something that's antiquated is one thing, but I think with the circumstances here having her pay taxes in the City I think is a very good compromise from some of the arguments that Mr. Gaughan had with the past administration . MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. DONAHUE : No. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. The ayes have it three to two. Mrs. Reed. MS.

(EMERGENCY CERTIFICATE ATTACHED ). MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MS. REED: Excuse me, Councilman Gaughan , we need a motion here. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, I'm sorry. I'm jumping the gun again. Thank you, Mrs. Reed. MR. DONAHUE : I'll make a motion to amend Item 7-A to add the following section , Section 6, this ordinance will become null and void and the suspension of the processes provided herein will expire upon rescindment or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 expiration of the operational restrictions placed on businesses and restaurants in Lackawanna County by the Governor of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Secretary of Health, which relates to the coronavirus known as COVID-19. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. There's been a motion. Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question . On the question , Solicitor Hayes, can you just kind of explain what that amendment is? ATTY. HAYES: Certainly . Thank you, Councilman Gaughan . The propose d resolution that was passed -- or that was sent down to us by the Law Department asked for a suspension of certain processes and to allow encroachment permits to go through without getting the normal approval s. I think the general consensus I receive d from Council was that was an appropriate step while these restrictions are in place because of the coronavirus . However , the way it was written , it was completely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 open-ended. So what we did was amend it to make it expire when all restrictions that are currently in place because of the coronavirus are lifted. So we'll go back to normal order after this whole pandemic has passed and all restrict ions that are placed on our businesses have been lifted. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you so much. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Just on the question , I just want to thank Kevin for putting this together because that was going to be one of my question s that I came up with that I was going to bring up in caucus tonight .
