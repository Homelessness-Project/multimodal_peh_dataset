DeltaMedixcouldhavegoneanywhere .It couldhavewenttoDickson City,itcould havewenttoDunmore ,couldhavewentto Moosic,buttheystayed inScranton and specifically theysaiddowntown ,infact, areadding towhattheirpresence downtown wasbefore sothat'savery,verypositive statement thatwasmadetoday. Also,Iattended afewmeetings this1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 week.AtthePELmeeting wetalked about, ofcourse,theauditandasCouncilman Wechsler mentioned wehopetohavethat completed priortothebudget oratleast priortofinalapproval ofthebudget. Ialsoattended ameeting aboutthe taxpayments issueorlegislation thatis beingpassed onTuesday withtheBAandthe Treasurer aswellasrepresentative fromthe Single TaxOfficeandwhatwearelooking to doiscreate asimple,seamless process for applicants oftheprogram .Themeeting went well,whichistheyarejustwaiting forthe firstapplicants whentheyapply.Weexpect theapplication fortheabatement toalsobe dispensed onthecity'swebsite .Iwill keepeverybody informed asyoumovethat forward ,butitwasavery,verygood meetingand,youknow,sometimes wehaveto beinvolved inpassing legislation . Sometimes wejustcan'tpassitandthen expect ittogetdonethewaywewantitto getdone,soIwashappywewereallableto gettogether onthis. Ialsoattended thesewermeetings ,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Iwassitting behind JoeandMarietothe rightinthebackandacouple oftakeaways fromthesewermeeting lastnight.Itwas somewhatinformative andtheproblem was, youknow,thehorsewasalready outofthe barn.Imean,Councilman Wechsler chided theSewerAuthority tohavethemeeting ,but theyreally should havehadthemeeting priortoanynotices goingout. Secondly ,Attorney Walker,who represents theSewerAuthority ,hemadea comment through thenightthatIthought was interesting hesaidhewasadvising the residents thatweretheretocontact their attorney sotheycouldissuealanguage to theeasement toreflect thatwhenworkwas doneontheproperty thattheproperty would bereturned toitsoriginal condition . That'sagreatidea,however ,andIthink Joementioned thishimself ,that'sgood advice butwhywasn'titontheoriginal letter thatwentouttotheproperty owners, sothat'ssomething weshould really lookat andwhyshould Iasaproperty ownerhavean attorney whenit'ssomething thatcouldhave1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 beenintheagreement rightoffthebat,so Ithinkthat'ssomething theyshould do. Again,possibly ,resending allofthe letters againinstead ofthreatening eminent domain Ithinkthatwouldbethefirstthing theyshould dopriortothatcourse of action. Also,Iwasatameetingasa requested bysomecitizens whowereinvolved inalotofspecial events downtownthat incorporate vendors aswellasTomWelbywho wasrepresenting FirstFriday.Imetwith themandtheBAandtheDirector ofLIPSto discuss revising legislation forpeddlers , vendors ,etcetera ,tomakeallinvolved and tomakeiteasier forallinvolved andto continue toencourage special events andthe useofvendors inthedowntown .Soitwasa veryproductive meeting ,we'rehoping to havenewlegislation thatwilladdress that comeoutbytheendofNovember sowecan havereadyforabigeventtheyweare planning forsometime intheDecember .

MR.GAUGHAN :Thankyou.Regarding theeasements fromtheSewerAuthority ,I wasn'tabletoattend,unfortunately attend thesewermeeting ,butfromwhatIhave heardfromsomeoftheresidents who attendedthemeetingandwhatIreadinthe paper,therehasbeenacomplete lackof regard forthepeople ofthiscity.The ignorance andthearrogance fromofficials fromtheSewerAuthority isdisgrace ful.I can'tbelieve thatyouwouldputtheonus theresidents ofthecity.It'snottheir faultandIdon'tthinktheattorneys atthe SewerAuthority aregetting themessage clearenough and,quitefrankly ,youknow,I thinktheyneedtobetoldthattheyarenot goingtobeabletobullytheirwaythrough thisdeal.Youknow,youarenotgoingto bullya75-year-oldperson whohaslived heretheirwholelifeandjustexpect them tosignapieceofpapersoIfoundthe wholethingtobequiteadisgrace.

MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou, Mr.Gaughan .SincetheSewerAuthority made outletters requesting citizens toprovide easements fortheirproperty access in August,Ihavebeenrequesting thatthe SewerAuthority communicate therequired information tohomeowners sotheycanmake aninformed decision onhowtoproceed with thedealing withthisrequest .Imetwith Mr.Barrett andattended ameeting ofthe SewerAuthority Boardandhavereached out toMr.Barrett weekly todetermine the status ofthepublic meetingthatwould inform theresidents .Inresponse tomy request ,themeeting washeldlastnight. Onlyafewoftheaffected parties attended andIthinkthatwasmostly duetothelack ofadvertising andtheshortnotice provided within theclassified section ofthe Scranton Times.Atthemeeting lastnight, itwasobvious thattheScranton Sewer Authority needstodoabetter jobat1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 communicating theparticulars ofthisissue. Iwouldencourage themtoprepare another letter toaffected homeowners.The threatening language offurther legalaction should beremoved fromthecorrespondence . Thenewletter should containamap detailing thelocation ofthesewerlineson theproperty ,andalsotheletter should contain thatifworkisrequired onasewer line,andIwouldliketoseethislanguage inthere,thatsaystheproperty isrestored toitsoriginal condition ,andfurther as described bytheproperty owner. Ialsowouldliketoseeastatement inthateasement thatwouldsaytheowner willbeexempt fromlitigation resulting in workinjury orproperty damage whileworkis beingperformed ontheowner'sproperty . Further examination ofthisissue leadsmetobelieve thattheseeasements are required tolettheutility workonprivate property .Inacaseofanemergency ,I'm surethatproperty owners wouldwantutility tofixtheproblem .Wearewellawareof Mr.Young'sproblem sgetting workdoneon1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 hisproperty .Heisrightfullyconcerned on granting access protecting himself from litigation .Also,thiseasement issue should notbeexpedited because ofthe impending saleoftheAuthority .Thisisan unknown problem thatexisted fortheentire lifeoftheScranton sewersystem.Some linesgoasfarbackas1861.Manyoriginal deedsgobackwhentheScranton areawas partofLuzerne County.Itseems unrealistic tocorrect a150yearerrorin eightweeks. Iamconcerned thatiftheAuthority failstogetthesigned easements thatit canfilerequests forcondemnation andthen thatcondemnation actwouldbesufficient forthesaletobecomplete .Asaresult, Pennsylvania American WaterCorporation wouldberequired tocomplete theeasement forcondemnation procedure .Thiswould leavethepublic todealwiththeprivate company instead ofpublic officials .I don'tbelieve thatit'sfairorjustfor homeowners totakemoneyoutoftheirown pocket topaylegalfeestoprotect their1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 interest against negligence caused bythe Authority andtheirpredecessors .Itisyet tobedetermined howtheselienswilleffect property values.Vacant landmaybecome unbuildable ifthereisaneasement onthe property . Ataminimum ,Iwouldsuggest that theAuthority prepare anewletter forthe taxpayers tofurther explain thisissue. Ultimately ,Iwouldliketheproces tobe delayed untilthereareassurances thatthe homeowners areprotected . Thescarypartofthisissuegoes backtothesamethingIspokeaboutlast week,thisissuehastobelooked at independent ofthesaleoftheSewer Authority .Theeasements onthese properties should havebeenattained backin the70'swhenthesewersystem wasbuilt, andI'mnotsureifitwassomething that justwasn'tpaidattention toorwenever thought weweregoingtosellthem,butit issomething that'sgoingtohavetobe completed whether theSewerAuthority sale proceeds ornotandbaseduponthecomments1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 ofthepeople lastnight,onceagain,these arejustregular people andtherewasnot onepolitical person therewhohadalineon theirproperty thatwasthere.Theseare justpeople fighting fortheirrights tobe protected anddefended. Theeasement saregoingtohaveto granted .Weheardtonight aboutrelocating thelines.Ifyoulookatthemap,that's goingtobeimpossible .Alotofthese properties arebuiltontopoflinesthat arethereforgenerations soseparating or rerouting thelinesisnotpractical .Many ofthemgorightunderthehomesso,once again,Iamconcerned thattheSewer Authority wouldjustabandon theletter issue,theletter writing campaign ,just issuethecondemnation andthenturnitover toPennsylvania American WaterCompany.I'm veryconcerned aboutthat,sohopefully they willcometosometypeofunderstanding on that. That'sthebybadnews.Idohave thepositive ,also.Getting backtowhat Mr.EvanssaidaboutDeltaMedix,Delta1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 Medixwasaggressively pursued byseveral communities inourarea.Thisisatrue victory forScranton andwehearalotof negative saboutusandcomments aboutusas agroup,butthefactthattheSteamtown Marketplace isnowafunction ingentity and it'sabletobesuccessful inattracting a majorcompany likeDeltaMedixandalso Luzerne Community College ,whenweasked Mr.Boscov ifhewasinterested indoing something likethathesaidno.Hewasonly interested inretail andhewouldnotcommit toanything likethatso,onceagain,Iam veryhappythatMr.Basalyga wasthe successful bidder onthemall,andnowthat youhavesomeanchors attheotherendI thinkyouwillseemoreretailspaceasthe mallmovesontowards theBoscov areaofthe store.
