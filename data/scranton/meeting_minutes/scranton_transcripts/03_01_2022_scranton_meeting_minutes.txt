CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FEBRUARY 25, 2022, FROM ALEX HAZZOURI , PRESIDENT /CEO OF FRIENDSHIP HOUSE, REGARDING THE FRIENDSHIP HOUSE DOWNTOWN SCRANTON BUILDING ACQUISITION AND RENOVATION PROJECT . 3-D. SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED DATED FEBRUARY 25, 2022. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comment s on any of the Third Order items? I just have one as it relates to the correspondence from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Mr. Hazzouri related to the Friendship House Project downtown . Mr. Hazzouri will be in our caucus on March 15th to discuss those plans and give us a briefing on that. Anyone else? Received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So tomorrow , you know, lent is upon us. The Knights of Columbus Council which is sponsoring a bring back dinner to the whole family fish fry. This will be at St. Ann's Basilica . And the dates will be Fridays , March 4th, March 18th, April 1st, April 8th. These will be between the hours of five and eight. The fish fry will be available only in the St. Ann's Basilica Shine building , dinning room in the Shrine building . That is at 1239 St. Ann's Street. And you have to preorder by calling the basilica shine office. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Any other Council members have any announcement s? I have two quick ones. Since Council returned to Council chambers last week we've kept a mandatory mask rule in effect for Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Chambers . Beginning next week we're going to follow CDC guidelines and masks will be optional starting next week. But I wanted to make sure we gave people enough time to prepare for that. And secondly , DePietro 's Pharmacy is organizing donation s to Ukraine and have asked that we share the following info: They are teaming up with their sweet customer Olena, whose family is currently in Ukraine to help their citizens with medical supplies . Monetary donations can be sent to St. Vladimir 's Ukrainian Catholic Church, 430 North 7th Avenue, Scranton . You could also donate medical supplies and drop them off at the church or DePietro 's Pharmacy which is on 3rd Street in Dunmore by this Friday, March 4th because the plane is leaving on Saturday . They're looking for Tylenol , pain relievers , anti-diarrhea , antacids , bandages , gauze pads, bandaids, elastic bandages , children 's clothing , non perishable food items and they're asking for no liquids . And that's all I have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, just a reminder that the Scranton Public Library is still going on through this Sunday, March 6th at the second floor at Marketplace at Steamtown right in front of Crunch Gym, great opportunity to get books at a very cheap price, one or two dollars . Okay, would you please update us on the status of the 2020 audit? MR. DONAHUE : We were told that a draft report was ready. But we still have not received that draft report. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And how about the negotiations on the various union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : They're still ongoing. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Last week I asked did anybody know what had happened to the database that used to be on the City's website for property taxes and refuse fees. And Marie mentioned to me that that might have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 disappeared if it was something done by Northeast Revenue . Is that why we don't have that database anymore? MR. DONAHUE : I'm not aware that that's the case. I'm thinking it's more of a transition to OpenGov . But we will have an answer for you -- MS. HODOWANITZ : If you could get it back up it would be nice. MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . MS. HODOWANITZ : I also asked last week but Mr. Mitesh Patel, the acting treasurer for a 35-day period what his qualifications were since there was no resume in the backup. MR. DONAHUE : So we did receive a resume. But we didn't receive it in time to post it in Third Order for this week. It will go in for next week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Since he was only appointed for a 35-day period, do we have any idea what's going to happen when that runs out or will he just be extended or will we have a real treasurer ? MR. DONAHUE : We're anticipating having a treasurer appointment come down to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Council . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. All right. In today's legislation the LSA grant for Nay Aug Park, 1 million dollar LSA grant, the backup under down side it says, City will need to use City funds to fund the match. Does that mean that the City then will have to come up with their own 1 million dollars to match that grant? Is that what that means? MR. DONAHUE : I'm sorry, which one was that? MS. HODOWANITZ : The LSA grant for Nay Aug Park. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : One million dollar grant. The downside according to the backup it says, quote, City will need to use City funds to fund the match. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : So the City is going to have to kick in a million dollars . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. On the overtime that was in Third Order, I see that LIPS is at 74 percent of it's budgeted overtime 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 as of February 24th. Is there a specific reason why they are exceeding budget so quickly ? MR. DONAHUE : Not that I know of but we will make that -- MS. HODOWANITZ : I would have expected DPW, you know, with the ice storms and things of that nature. But I wasn't quite sure why LIPS was in that category . And you already answered my questions about the masking update. Thank you. You have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , would we able to send correspondence to Eileen Cipriani regarding the LIPS overtime ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up in the morning , Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . I hope everybody pays close attention to what I'm about to speak about. I'm going to read the City Code right now for the garbage fee: All fees shall be deposit ed in a special city interest bearing account to be established by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 the Business Administrator . This account will be used to reimburse the City General Fund for cost incurred directly for the disposal of refuse. That means that the law says that that money we pay in for the garbage fee can only be used for disposal for the operation budget down at DPW. Now, this garbage fee is in effect for over 10 years. And since then, the money that we've been paying was 178 then it went to 300. That money has been used for the work down at the DPW, plus they put money into the General Fund every year which is illegal . It says it shall only be used for the use -- the bills down there. That's it. But every year -- and I've come to Council over 10 years now asking these questions . And I've gotten the runaround. Everybody tells me, oh, they lost the records of something when they don't know where they are. They even asked you is there money going into a general fund. And you even admitted , yes, it's going into a general fund. I can't believe that you're not doing something about this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. DONAHUE : I'm sorry, but we also did get an explanation that that money is accounted for. MS. FRANUS: What's that? MR. DONAHUE : That that money is accounted for. The breakdown of that money is accounted for. MS. FRANUS: Well, I want to know is that money being used in the General Fund? I was told it was. So here's my point. From what I understand this morning what the City might do now is change that law -- that legislation and amend it to say that they can use that money in the garbage fee for the General Fund to pay their bills plus the garbage fee -- to pay for the DPW usage. Now, if that's the case, that means that our garbage fee money is $300 will be used to pay city bills, plus for the garbage fee. Why should we be paying for City bills? We've been doing it for the last 10 years no matter what you say. You can't prove otherwise. They admitted it's going into the General Fund. So I don't think it's right. And I'm here against my kids' wishes because of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 this health pandemic thing. But you didn't leave me any choice. I asked Frank, the City Clerk to have all you Council members call me. I wanted to talk to you about allowing people, the writing letters and read them aloud like you used to when it was Zoom. Bill Gaughan said absolutely not. So, Kyle, when you called me you said no. You're not going to allow letters to be read aloud. You said anybody can look them up. No they can't. I don't even know how to find them. Half the senior citizen s in this City don't even know how to use a computer . MR. DONAHUE : I said we would attach them to the minutes that we wouldn't read them aloud that we would attach them to the minutes . That is the official record of Council . MS. FRANUS: That's not the point. The point is, they should be read aloud so people could hear the question . I could be asking these questions instead of coming here if I was allowed to. You said no. You know what you said to me, Kyle? You said it was a waste of time. You told me it was a waste of time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 I'm speaking now. And when these people speak at Council , are they a waste of time too? And the nerve of you, Mr. McAndrew , last week to say that you want to hear what the people say. Who, just Marie and Joan and the people that speak here? How about the rest of the people in this City? Do you want to hear from them or no. No, probably not because you don't want to be held accountable for anything . Mr. Schuster and Mr. McAndrew , all you want to do is grandstand every week go on and on about the Mayor or about DPW not getting the street done, not getting it plowed when all you had to do -- any of these people that called you or wrote to you, all you had to say was call the dispatcher . Why do we have to come to you and then four days later after the snow is gone, you're complaining about streets that supposedly aren't plowed or will be plowed. No word of respect , any word of thank you to DPW guys for doing such a great job. No, no, it's you have to get this street plowed, grandstand, grandstand .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 And, Miss Rothchild , you told me you were going to make a motion to have the people read the letters aloud. And you never did that night. You just forgot it. You didn't it. So why don't you want the people to be heard? You just don't because you don't want to be held accountable . Another thing -- and this is very important , the sewer sale -- the Sewer Authority sale. The City got millions and millions of dollars that are to be held in escrow. Okay, Jason Shrive and his employee s were going through millions and million s of dollars . Somebody better check into this. Nobody is. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner and taxpayer . First off, my thoughts and prayers are with the country of Ukraine and the people there and people of the Ukrainian religion that live here that have relatives over there. I hope this comes to a quick resolution . This is -- Putin is just a bully. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Anyway, on Talk Back 16 tonight the caller had a good idea. Instead of state stores not selling the Russian alcohol that's all paid for anyway, they should sell it -- that's what this gentleman said -- and send the profits to the people of Ukraine to help them out. I think that's a great idea instead of just throwing it away or whatever they are doing. Anyway, so much for that. Today in the mail the yearly event. I got my rental registration form, which I've argued here for years and years and years I shouldn 't have to register . I'm exempt from paying according to the ordinance . If any of you ever looked at it, it specifically says if you're exempt you do not have to register . And I keep getting the notice in the mail every year. Last year I called and talked to the director . And I said this last year. He said don't send it in and he hung up on me. I'm not sending it in. But they keep sending me the notice in the mail every year. And it's getting really annoying . I spoke to the Mayor twice and she was suppose d to look into it. I never heard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 from her. So I hope something is done. And I'm not the only one that it happens to. And it's postage being spent that shouldn 't have to be. Anyway, that's all. I'm not sending that in. I'm not going to waste my time because I don't have to do it. Until they rewrite the ordinance , I will not do it. I'm not a lawyer. But I know you don't have to. It specifical ly says if you live at that property , you do not have to register . Well, somebody should wake them up in the LIPS Department and get that taken care of. Lastly, upon further inspection of my tax bill after I was here last week, I did see where $600 -- I have a double so I have to pay $600 for my garbage fee. But how do I know I'm getting the $60 off which is 10 percent . MR. DONAHUE : That's factored into the -- MR. SPINDLER : How would I know though? I don't know what my taxes are from year to year. How do I know they're taking $60 off? MR. DONAHUE : You're -- I mean, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 you're going to have to take that up with the Tax Collector 's Office on how they set up the bill. We don't have control of that -- MR. SPINDLER : And I also looked at my receipt from last year. And it said $60, not 540. So I think I'm getting ripped off along with everyone else in this City. I think that's why the City wants to put it in with the property taxes so they could steal money from the people. I don't know if I'm paying 540 or $600. It should be 540. And before you people -- well, not all of you up there; but before Council decided to put it in with our property taxes, I knew what I was paying. I came to City Hall and I paid $540. Now I don't know if I'm paying 500, 540, or 600. And somebody should be looking into it. I think the people are getting ripped off. And it's not fair. Thank you for your time. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening Council , Lee Morgan. My first thing here tonight is that, you know, I appreciate Council and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Mayor, you know, wishing the Ukrainian people the best. But I'm just thoroughly amazed as I have really stuck pretty tight to what's going on in Ukraine because I have satellite radio in my truck. I drive a truck for a living so I have been really listening to it for -- since the conflict started . And I think the American people should know that -- and people could check this out themselves . They could do whatever they want to do. Ukraine gave up all its nukes and America guaranteed -- basically their sovereignty . Well, what's generally occurred is the U.S. -- the U.S. government never really stood their military up until Trump was President . And then he gave them the antiaircraft missile s and antitank missiles, not enough to defend their country but enough to get them started . And they were using these against the Russians . And then they were running out. And our President didn't give them any lethal aid. I don't know what he was sending them, blankets or medical supplies . So the Polish 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 and Romanians took from their stockpile and sent them to Ukraine . And then the Germans sent a thousand and then the Turkish sent some. And now, there's some stuff in Washington now. But, you know, the one thing we learned in this whole thing is that America 's military has been underfunded for decades . And when I was child -- I'm 62. I'm going to be 63. America had the ability to fight two full wars on two fronts. We don't even have enough equipment to really fight a full-blown war on one front now. And I just think we totally lack leadership because it's the Germans and the Italians that put SWIFT in play, not the President of the United States, okay? It's Europe that started putting the punishing sanction s on Russian , not the United States. As a matter of fact, our own President couldn't even go there. He had to send Kamala Harris there because he's in -- I believe the early stages of dementia . And he can't remember what he's doing and where he's going. And we're in big 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 trouble here because the Russians are definitely threaten ing to nuke us. Nobody is laughing about that because Putin has no respect for human life. All right? And the saddest part of that of all is that when Reagan was in the White House he talked about a star wars defense putting platform s in space so that when a missile did an arch we'd blow it up in outer space because they punch out through atmosphere and come back in. We never built that. You know what we've done in this country ? We've exported all of our industry and all the people that refused to work we've sent them money. I mean, you remember the meeting that was here and the Mayor talked about the money that we're getting and they were going to find the illegal s to give money to. I sat right there and I listened to it right in this chamber . We've got big problems . And the other thing I have here tonight -- and that's when the President gives his address tonight , I don't know if it's worth watching , no disrespect to his office. But he only writes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 what the teleprompters tell him to say. And you can't convince me those are his words. And when he does -- when he takes a question from a reporter, they're lined up and he's told who to ask for and then the teleprompter tells him what they're going ask and what he's going to say back. This is the guy that is protecting the free world and the Democrat ic party in my opinion put a candidate up that could not do the job. And then we find out the Durham investigation that the Russian hoax was just a hoax from Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee . But yet, we as Americans want to be safe and we want to be free. But we're good at playing politics . Now, the other thing I have here, Mr. Donahue , you know, I hope you tell the people in the City of Scranton maybe at a later meeting how much the City of Scranton spent to put all the signs up for the road and why they took them down. You probably can't figure that out. And that's not a personal shot at you because you weren't on Council then. And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 don't know what notes are left from that money being spent. But, you know, I drive a truck. And I see all the old signs sitting on light poles in the middle of the woods and I'm not even kidding you. I'm dead serious . The first time I drove -- I couldn't believe it. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Your time's up. MR. MORGAN: Okay. I'll be back. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Appreciate it. Next on the list is Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton , about Joe Biden, he's not Donald Trump. That's the -- he tried to extort that poor guy. Last week I ended up -- I fell a little short. I apologize for that. From what I'm reading , DeNaples ' landfill or land pile, whatever you want to call it, wants to run either pipes directly from the leachate pools going straight down to the gorge about Nay Aug. And once again, what do you mean? You could trust me. I shouldn 't have to pay to put this into the sewage treatment plan. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 shouldn 't have to have this monitor ed. You know, your problem s don't mean a hill of beans compared to the desires and requirements of the DeNaples empire. So, I mean, we have to really get on it. I don't want to holler at anybody . I voted for everybody including the Mayor. I'd like to see people getting along and start getting involve d in some activism here because we're getting nothing from them except a pile of garbage . And then they want to pollute one of the purest streams that comes into the City. You could practically drink that water right off the falls, except for the DeNaples landfill and his junkyard up above it. In the 60s, Lady Bird Johnson had a fence erected in the area where you could look over 81 and see the scrap yard. And now there is just -- well, if you want to go up and take apart and bring it back and pay for it, the prices are higher. They wanted 30 bucks for a little bumper part. I went up to Anthracite and got the whole bumper, bumper cover, and the bumper struts for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 $52. And you take it off yourself and they'll bring it down. That's with this -- I mentioned it last week externalizing a business 's expenses when they don't have to fix the problem s that they have created like the dumps, the abandoned mines, the pools of water and strip mines that, I mean, kids even used to swim in them in my area. But you never knew what was on the bottom, you know? And the whole town just surround ed, it was like an island except for the three roads that left town and that was it. And it's a shame. I hope that we can change our -- change our attitudes seeing how we're trying to fix the environment . It's not going to work with people like that, Empire Landfill ruling the roost. And hopefully the President will have something to say to the antivaxers tonight . We're suppose d to be out of the woods, but I've heard that so many times already . You know, I just heard it too many times. Yeah, the news was good in the paper. And I'll try and get this in finally . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 I have about a minute here. Fiscal watchdog -- now, this is two or three weeks old. I spoke it on it before. Budget report becomes a political flash point in school funding fight. And the whole thing about it is they don't feel that if we -- from the school's property in Pennsylvania according to incomes of people and how much taxes they could collect how to be public in the town that if the scores don't increase , they shouldn 't have to spend it. But scores will never increase if they don't have -- if they don't spend money. And even worse yet, even the wealthier kids are getting a poorer education . Thank you and have a good night. I might duck out early. I'll catch you on the television . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhaust s the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , I will start with Seventh Order items because you'll be voting on them tonight . Hopefully I'll get into some other things, however . 7-F, I am vehemently against this unless you are willing to make this a proposition that will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 happen for every corner that has a gas station , a former gas station on it. We can't do anything because the property owners can't do anything with it because the ground needs remediation and there's probably been leaks from the station . And I do believe 524, which I couldn't find it, Penn Avenue is privately owned by Mobile Oil or otherwise I don't think they would be splitting the cost of this. It's really a $200,000 project according to the backup. And so half of it's for a private owner. If you want to go find some other ones, Moosic Street where everybody from 307 comes down and comes into the City downtown that's -- there's one there that has been blighted and an eyesore for a long time. There is another going down Luzerne Street. There is another one there that causes problems . And I'm sure there are others around the City. So unless you're willing to do that for every private owner who has a closed gas station , I suggest you take another look. Next, 7-A, just a comment because I don't see how you can put a million dollars 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 into that building . It's a well-structured building . And I don't know if you've had a separate -- a separate , I guess, quote for how much that is -- is really going to be to do that. And also again, it is -- there's been a lot of money over this last decade in that -- put into that corridor while other areas of the City, other neighborhoods keep waiting for something , probably a lot of them anything . So we have the 500 of Lackawanna Avenue downtown . Now you've got something on again tonight where you -- where you're going to borrow money I believe for another downtown project . It's time to look at areas that haven't received anything at all in the last umpteen years. Those poor people I'll never forget them because it's been 20 years since they came to this podium and said, "Could we please get our road paved? It hasn't been paved in over 50 years." And so now it's probably another at least 20. So I think you have to do some prioritizing . Remember in a couple years, we're going to get a tax increase of 20-some percent . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 You have got to look beyond this year and spend, spend, spend. And I don't think you should be putting out any money for the monies that are going to be coming to us until we know what the ground rules are and until you've have a public hearing . Otherwise , there's not going to be anything left by the time you guys get around to doing a survey or whatever you're going to do. I don't think it's a fair way to operate . And then tonight 3-C, I guess that's another property that's going to be going off the tax rolls. I don't know if anybody looked to see into the questions I asked last week about if you could have a partial -- maybe in Fifth Order -- MR. DONAHUE : I'll have an answer for you in Fifth Order. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, I'm anxious to hear those. And then this is sort of tiny in the grand scheme of things. But in Friday's paper there was a 5 and a half inch legal notice which, you know, I don't understand . This was on a Friday afternoon . And does anybody know when the bid opening was or is? I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 suggest you start reading legal notices . MR. DONAHUE : When? MS. SCHUMACHER : Monday. Now, to me that's terrible . It makes -- it has a definite implication that it's geared for somebody . Who knows it's going to be in two days. I think you should actually change the code so that the time between the legal notice for asking for bids and the bid opening gives everybody enough time to participate , especially on a weekend (inaudible ). MR. DONAHUE : Let me talk to you about that after. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , I take a look back at this electric car purchase . And I go back to the Fire Department and gas cards and vehicles being used for personal use down outside of the City and being charged to City funds. These electric cars are supposedly to go to a specific purpose of zoning. But there is nothing in there that actually limits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 or allots them to zoning. They could be the Mayor's personal car or whoever else it's actually handed to. With the electric ity being used for them, is there going to be a way to monitor the electric consumption who's using it, is there going to be an actual logbook of mileage , is it going to go home with people, is it going to be allowed to be used as a personal car? There's a lot of things involved in that. Way back then we talked in this body about having GPS put on vehicles , not only the trash trucks but a number of City trucks. We're going to spend for 10 very expensive electric vehicles when we haven't even addressed GPS equipment to track the vehicles that we have to make sure that they are being used properly for City business and not being used majority for personal business rather than City. I had to take a look at electric cars because I had to circle back and look at the new data. Batteries for them can run anywhere from $8,000 to replace all the way up to 40,000 depending on the vehicle that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 bought. The best ones on the market are from, of course, Elon Musk. And they're an average of eight years lifespan. Of course, you have to take into account that those batteries are also outdoors in California . They are not in the colder environment s. So we're looking at a continuing budget for battery replacement which is quite extensive , not even counting the recent problems with fires with these cars themselves . There are a number of factors involved with electric cars. I think they're wonderful . But I think they are not ready for TV. I think at this point in time natural gas vehicles are much more prudent . If an electric car gets smashed , guess what? You're not going to repair it like you are a gas or a car vehicle because when the component s get smashed inside of an electrical vehicle in an auto accident , you might as well just throw the car away and get a new one. They are incredibly expensive for maintenance in case of accident during operation . That's all that I have to say about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 that. Now, as for the U.S. and Ukraine , I have been a little bit distracted over the last week and haven't looked at a lot of the numbers over the electric cars because I've been monitoring US air traffic in Poland and Romania . And to say that we have been absent from that push and from the forces overseas is completely ignorant . For the past week and a half, we have circling three straddle tanker air fillers , four drones, and two spy planes that have been looping in the Baltic Sea area coming out of Greece. We are not blind in the area. We have been monitoring the border and up there with forces 24/7. At this point in time someone in the military actually picked up that it might be a good idea to change or remove some of the call signs identifying those planes that are up in the air as they're visible to everyone else out there. But I want to assure you that Britain , the United States has taken a strong forefront in supporting the Ukrainian people by intelligence , by air coverage , surveillance and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 keeping the border between Ukraine , Poland Romania secure and under watch. Hopefully , it will wind up to be a -- to cool down this situation . But I just want you to be aware that we are there. And we do have eyes there. And we are participating . We are not letting everyone else take the burden. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I'm a senior citizen surprise , surprise . But getting around downtown now with the ice, it's really treacherous . I was on Washington Avenue this week going to the Cultural Center to get some tickets . And I kept thinking where am I going to park? I have to climb over this mountain of ice to get in. I went in and got my ticket. Now that I'm in, I have to get back. So tonight pulling up I'm hoping that in front of City Hall would have been a little bit better but it wasn't. I saw someone , one of the speakers tonight pulled up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 in back of me and jumped out of his car, hopped over that pile of ice out there. You know, I can't go hopping over any kind of ice out there. I don't want to fall. I don't want to break something . So my idea is, I know, like, putting down salt and sun should really do the job of getting those piles of ice down. And I know we had two ice storms two Fridays in a row so I understand that. But I also understand that we want our citizens to be safe as we move around the City. And right now I don't think it's very safe unless you go to the corner. But when you park your car, you got to get out and then have to pay at the meter, you know, for the use of that parking spot there. So that's a little side bar as to my normal. The second thing I wanted to ask someone , I didn't get a chance to call down to DPW for this one. But maybe they could hear it. At the corner of Mulberry and North Webster , there's a beautiful North Webster sign that's hanging down. It was up for -- it was three things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 that held it up. Now, it's only hanging by one. And it's going to be someone -- hit someone 's car or a person just riding around or walking around. So I'm hoping that someone can get that over to the DPW to get that fixed. And, of course, my favorite subject I was thinking it's a terrible thing as we go through life we have to learn to patient . Patience is one of the virtues I think that I struggled with and I don't know who else in this room struggles with. So after I was up there a few weeks ago talking about the street signs and I did have communication s with DPW about the street signs and all. So, of course, I have to learn -- try to learn to be a little bit patient . They are working with the street signs and getting them up. And they divided them into section s of the City. So the Hill Section where I live, you know, those signs are up. The next section is going to be South Side and then West Side. So it makes sort of sense to do it that way. But it also goes against patience , you know, that we want them to be now. I mean, we're a now 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 generation . But when you have 9,000 signs to put up, you know, we can't be a now generation . So I just wanted to let everyone know out there that the street signs are coming. But it just takes us -- it takes a little while. I've been talking for four years about the street signs and it's good to see that there is advancement on the street signs. But we just have to be patient with it and I'm sure they're doing all they can down there at DPW to work on the street signs. They do have another vendor that's working with them. So maybe we'll see some more advancement in the near future. That's all I have to say. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Miss Jeffries . I actually did see that sign at Mulberry and North Webster late this afternoon and I just haven't had a chance to contact . That's first on my list tomorrow . MS. JEFFRIES : Okay. It's been that way for a couple of weeks now. MR. DONAHUE : I just noticed it today. Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. I have two things this evening . The first thing I apologize . I forgot to mention earlier that I just quickly wanted to announce and make a reminder that the Beautiful Blocks Program is open for application s for 2022. You could place an application in by March 21st or preapplications rather. So I know NeighborWorks has been in previously to discuss that. And we've often talked about the Beautiful Blocks Program , which has been really successful the last few years. I would encourage any resident s who are interested in making changes to the exterior of their home to take a look at NeighborWorks and that program 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 and see if they could partner with other neighbors to get that accomplished . And then the other thing that I wanted to bring up to discuss tonight , I did mention that I would be meeting with our public health coordinator , Dr. Saxena. And we met last week. And so I just wanted to provide a brief overview of some of the things that we discussed . We had a great and long conversation about what she's been doing in that office since she's been in that position . And I was really impressed to hear about all of the activities . And first, I just wanted to mention that on the website there is a dashboard with data for COVID on there. So that's available to the public. And they recently published a public health page on the website . And there's a lot of great information that people can find on that site. And if there's something that the public feels is missing , then I'm sure they'd be open to adding additional information on there. So you could find out about upcoming events and program s -- health programs in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 City that you might be interested in. She has been doing a lot on the COVID front. There's a recovery team that the City has. So I know she's very active in that and in providing recommendations on COVID to the City, to the Mayor. There have been vaccine clinics. And there's more that are planned as well. There will be one that they're hoping for a children 's fair to take place over the spring time. And they've also been trying to provide vaccines in different neighborhoods around the City to make them more accessible . And she's been helping health clinics that they're looking to host housing developments primarily . And we're looking at doing a possible blood drive which is really necessary right now. There's a high need for blood. So I'm really looking forward to the City being able to do that. There are various coalition s that she serves on as a representative from the City, including ones for suicide prevention , drug and alcohol recovery . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 There will be a recovery panel that's going to be held by the state. But it will be taking place locally . And I know that she's going to be serving on that panel and representing the City. She's been doing a great deal of work connect ing with local and nonprofit organizations , schools , colleges , really making those connections with those people so that when we do have events when we want to partner with someone , we know who to go to. And they know that we're interested in that and we have the public health coordinator working on those things here so -- and other agencies -- the agencies -- so that does take quite a bit of time to make those connections to build those lists and then we have things going on to reach out to those partners . And then on the employee health front I know that she's been working with Highmark to be able to promote their services that -- like City employees have. It's through their insurance so that people are aware of the different services . And in October they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 partnered with Delta Medix to hold cancer screening s for City employees . And then they are looking to partner with the NAACP on a health fair coming up in the spring too. There's a lot of great things on the public health front that are happening with the City. And I encourage people to take a look at the page for some more information . I'd be happy to answer any additional question s. And I'm sure she'd be open to coming for a caucus one night if we wanted her to. That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So I want to start with the refuse fee. So, of course, last year, you know, we embedded the refuse fee into the tax bill. I like the idea. I think we all agree because the collection rate has increase d dramatically . But there's still issues with exonerations . I receive d a few complaints over the past week with regard to the exoneration process . And for those of you out there that don't understand how that works is, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 there's still houses or properties being identified as having rentals that they don't. So they're being charged a bill. All right? And then they have to pay it and then apply for exonerations , which means get your money back or prove that I don't have three apartments . I only live as a single dwelling or maybe I had an apartment 20 years ago. But some of the concern s I got like a bar owner being charged $900 last year, filled out the exonerations form to get the money back and has yet to get it. And the same 900 was charged again this year or embedded into her bill. And she has her own private contractor because she has to pick up her garbage . So I know last year we said, oh, you know, or we heard that there will be some kinks they need to work out. Obviously they haven't been worked out. So these concern s that were sent to me, Mr. Voldenberg graciously sent them -- and I said send them to the related department s that need to know about these concerns . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 So I got back two responses , one is from our City Tax Collector , Cathy Wechsler . And she sent a letter -- and she's doing a great job and she's trying to work through this. She sent a letter to the Business Administrator on January 21st. I'm not going to read the whole letter but I'm going to read the meat of it that makes sense. And what it says is, "I understand that there were discussions between the City and my predecessor concerning the ability of the Single Tax Office to handle refuse fee exonerations with its present staff. Hiring a new employee to handle the refuse fee exonerations in 2021 never materialized . And it was my understanding that the City is not planning to fund the position in the Single Tax Office for this year. As such, the Single Tax Office has got a procedure for the collection of the refuse fee which is include d in 22 -- I'm sorry, 2022 real estate tax bill." So in essence , what the Tax Collector is saying is, the Single Tax Office will collect the full amount of the City and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 school district real estate taxes along with the refuse fee due on the date of payment . But refuse fee exonerations will not be done in the Single Tax Office. All refuse fees exonerations and refunds will be handled by the City of Scranton . All right. So this letter was sent on January 22nd to the administration . And in closing in her letter she said, education on refuse fee collection process is critical to avoid taxpayer confusion which is happening abundantly now. Accordingly , it is essential that the new procedure be fully explained to the public through mailing s, the media, the City and the Single Tax Office websites , social media and otherwise . Dissemination of this information needs to be started immediately . And I agree. But this letter is over a month old. And I would like to take the opportunity to further discuss the procedure with you. So with that said, I agree because I'm getting all types of questions like how do I get it, where do I fill it out, what's going on? No one is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 answering the phone. So and then I received another correspondence from the acting treasurer . He stated that -- the acting treasure -- this is from Frank Voldenberg , Council secretary . He said he visited the office early today and advised that he's working with the Single Tax Office and City administration to pinpoint the time when and where the Single Tax Office should be notified about any exonerations in addition to any permanent exonerations to avoid incorrect billing year after year -- so-called kinks that weren't worked out yet. He's also reaching out to the county assessor's office today that will keep Council apprised of his findings . All right. So this is a start in the right direction . Is it late, yes. But with that said -- and I look forward to hearing some updates . But last week I made a motion to develop our own City Council request log. And these concern s are going to be in there. Like I said, these will be visible , trackable for administration , us, and all of you. So with that said -- and you're doing a great job 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 populating this, Mr. Voldenberg . He just started . And I'm very excited about it. So with that said and at the risk of grandstand ing, I'd like to address Miss Franus's concern s about e-mailing concerns , inquiries , questions , complaints that aren't read here aloud. Well, I think we should consider just putting them in here. It's pretty much the same thing as the way I'm reading it or being read because it's going to be visible , all right, and trackable by, like I said earlier , administration , Council , and all of you. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just quickly , first, I would like to wish everybody of Welsh ancestry a happy St. David's Day. And I'd also like to congratulate Paul Dean on his retirement after 33 years in service as a police mechanic . His service is greatly appreciate d. In terms of Miss Schumacher 's questions from last week in terms of a for profit business operating under the umbrella of a nonprofit institution and then also a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 nonprofit renting off a for profit business , in terms of the for profit operating under the umbrella of a nonprofit institution , it's my understanding that we have all the ability to go after those to carve them out in terms of how taxes are collected . It's just a matter of the staff to actually do it. So at the moment it technically falls on the assessor 's office because that's where we get our data from. I'm hoping, you know, we could work to a point where we start targeting that. I'm hoping a reassessment will help in that to target those for profit entities that operate under the nonprofit umbrella . In terms of non profits renting off -- I know you bought up the mall at Steamtown as an example . From what I was told and from a couple different sources is there's no legal remedy to carve those out because at the end of the day, the for profit business is still making a profit off of the rent they charge to the nonprofit . I hope that answers your question . And just to address Mrs. Franus's comments , in terms reading out comments out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 loud, I really don't feel comfortable making anybody read words that aren't theirs. And that's why I called it a waste of time. I feel like that's a slippery slope when you ask somebody else to read someone else's statements . That's why I said if someone wanted to -- if someone feels uncomfortable coming to Council and they want to submit comment s, we will place that into the minutes . And that's the official record so that there is a record of that. But besides that, I just don't feel comfortable asking anybody to read somebody else's words and/or statements , sentiments , etc. And that's all I have tonight . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

And taxes should be well spent. So in 1987 Act 47 was enacted , okay, and then January of '92, Scranton went into distressed status. All right. So PEL was here for 30 years.

MR. DONAHUE : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-E. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , so in caucus I made a suggestion that we talk with the administration to see what the clear picture is of this department . We have several things happening at the same time. This here is to go out for a grant to keep PEL on. That's one thing. We have independent funding for a Director of Finance , that's another piece of this puzzle. We have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 Rainey and Rainey conducting services for the City, that's another piece of this puzzle. And I think we need to get a clear picture of what's happening in this department to see where they're moving forward . So I understand that this is a piece of it. But I think -- me personally, I've never been -- it's never been explained to me what route and what the vision is of this administration for the department . So I think that Council does needs to hear what that is. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. First of all, I apologize for losing my place earlier on reading the resolution s. Like I said earlier , I don't like to vote against grants but, you know, they're considered free money. But they're really not free money. They're taxes that should be well spent. So like I said earlier , Act 47 was enacted in 1987. We went into 1992, 30 years ago. PEL was selected for us to navigate and exit Act 47. This resolution is asking PEL to come back and help us navigate some more. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 And then we were told that the reason the administration wants to bring PEL back is because we voted down -- or I shouldn 't say voted down -- the majority of us disagreed with the finance director in last year's budget for this year's budget. And this was a way to satisfy that. But it appears that administration is seeking both. All right. So this is a vote on principle . All right, I believe we're in a good place. That's what we were told by administration after we exited Act 47. I believe that our administration needs to pull themselves by their bootstraps and let's stand on our own and get the job done. So for them reasons , I'll be voting no. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR.

KING: On the question , as Miss Schumacher had indicated earlier , it does get a little concerning when we're, you know, we're pumping money into a private business that you expect that they contaminated the water in that area that they would be responsible for it. And certainly , I don't want to see a precedent set on this. But, however , if we are able to get a grant to help offset this and it's going to help the health and safety of the people in that area I'd probably support this. But it is a little concerning that we have to come to the rescue of a private business who if they were responsible for that contamination , they should be responsible for all of the cleanup. That's all. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. King, would you support a motion to table this until we get more information ? MR. KING: I could support that, yes. MR. SCHUSTER : I make a motion to table. MR.
