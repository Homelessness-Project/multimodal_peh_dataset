KING: Okay, if there are no comments on Third Order, received and filed. Now, do any Council members have any announcements ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. SMURL: Oh, I'm sorry. MR. KING: That's all right. My only announcement is it looks like we have a big storm coming tomorrow . So I encourage everyone to please be careful when driving throughout the day and walking I think will be somewhat treacherous . That's it. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . You all know what time of year it is, right? It's tax time. And for those who would like to pick up copies of Form 1040 and the instructions , it's just a simple trip up the street to the Scranton Public Library . They have the English version right now. They are waiting the Spanish version . If you need other forms and schedules down there, they'll help you do that. And if you try to get the forms out of the local IRS office, good luck. They aren't very helpful . I'd like to compliment Marie Banicky -- I hope I'm saying that properly for her $200 donation to the Scranton Police Department 's K-9 account . I think she's done 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 that on more than one occasion . That's very nice. Do we have any update on the status of the 2021 audit? Chugging along, are we? MR. KING: We are. I don't believe anything has changed from what we reported last week. I think we're hoping for midFebruary . MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, well, a couple things. I saw in the paper the RFP for the 2022 audit. The bids were due on February 7th. So it looks like we'll be hiring the next auditor before the 2021 audit is done. But that's all right. And then I was also very amused to read the Controller 's report for December . And in that report, guess what we did? We paid Kohanski $10,000 when, in fact, maybe Kohanski should be paying us $10,000. You know, if you missed the September 30 deadline for the audit, we have the option of a 10 percent fine against that company . And he's missed -- that company 's missed the deadline four years running . And I don't think we've ever asked for a refund. Well, I guess it's just taxpayer money. And then how about the arbitrations for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 firefighter and police union contracts ? MR. MCANDREW : Firefighters occurred today, the first arbitration meeting . And my understanding is I don't know if it's next week or shortly , the second one. The police, I'm not sure when that's scheduled . I know it was scheduled and it was postponed . I'm not sure when that's going to have to take place. MR. KING: -- hearing that it may be toward the end of January early February for the police. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. They've been without a contract for over a year. However , also in the December Controller 's report you may have noticed that Ufberg and Associates , the labor counsel for the city picked up a check for $32,407.59. So that's where your taxpayer dollars are going. I was surfing the website again -- city's website , not much progress or changes there. I find it very amusing that the home page, the picture is of the clock of the 500 block of Lackawanna Avenue which has been broken for many a moon. You know, it's kind of symbolic of the website itself. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 And, oh, yes, I see that the Ethics Board is meeting every two months. The next one will be I believe March 15th. I'm going to go and ask a few questions . I saw in their minutes that they made a change to the Ethics Code. I want to make sure that it gets archived at City Hall. I'd like to know what, you know, whether they are meeting the requirements of the Ethics Code itself. They are suppose d to be posting several items on the City's website . I don't think that's been done yet. I would even wonder if they have copies of the last union contracts since the union contracts -- if there's a conflict between the code and the union contracts , the union contracts win out. So it would be to their advantage to sit down and read those union contracts . But remember , you know, they're still not all on the website , you know. So you have a good night. MR. KING: I'll speak to that in Fifth Order. Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : Thank you. MR. KING: Lee Morgan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I guess my opening remarks could be that on Thursday at 5:30 I will be at ECTV. Hopefully Council President King and Smurl -- Councilman Smurl and the rest of Council will appear there so we could start a dialogue , not myself but with the residents . And any comment s that I have to make at that time will not be political . And there will be no attacks because I don't attack people. But I think the residents have a right to the facts, information and an understanding of what their government plans to do. And going forward as I do these videos on ECTV, there's going to be a lot of issues that are going to come up that I'm going to address . I'm just starting now. I have no intention s to ever run for public office because I just have no interest in it. But I would like to bring a lot of people forward that, I guess, understand the city and have a multitude of different opinions other than my own. But I think moving forward we need to rewrite the charter and we need to find out who we are as Scrantonians and where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 we want to go and where we want our city to go. I do have to say on many instances I'm troubled by where our city is at soon to be 64 years old. I think it's important for every resident in this city to understand one thing. We don't live forever . And we've got to pass something onto our children that's worth having. And in order to do that, we have to do something different than what we've done for decades before. And I think part of it is listening and trying to understand where we have to go together as a community . And we cannot continue to tax people out of their homes and lack of vision and direction on where we want the city to go. And in my own opinion , I think we wasted 30 years under Act 47. I'm thankful that the Scranton School Board directors realize d that recovery wasn't a good idea for the Scranton School District because it wasn't taking us somewhere good. And I just hope that we elect a mayor that has a vision that understands that today is a new day and our ancestors have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 here for a long time, probably is 150 years or more my family probably has been here going back to my great, great grandfather . And probably my relatives were here even before that because I really don't know where my relatives came from. But we have to find a vision for this city. And the only way we're going to do that is we're going to sit down and we're going to talk about it. Now, some people will refuse to talk and some people will stonewall. But in the end just as it always is true, they will be overcome because that's what politics does. People become disenfranchised from their electorate . And the electorate casts them out. And I think for too long we've accepted the fact that whatever somebody spewed verbally is where they were taking us and it hasn't been where we've gone. We've gone all the wrong ways. Look at our neighborhoods , nothing like when I was a child. The old women were out there with the broom sweeping the streets , caring about the neighborhood s. And you know, it's not a personal attack. Look at the city. Lift your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 eyes up and look at the downtown , look at the neighborhoods . We can't go this way anymore. And not only I have to see it but the residents have to see it and the people in Harrisburg have to see it. And we need a common goal to create employment centers in this city and give the children that are born here that go to school here opportunity to find employment and advancement here and politics isn't going to do that, leadership is and the ability to work together and see other people's ideas and visions other than just your own because the multitude has to be heard somewhere . And if we close them out forever , ignore them, they'll never be heard and we'll never change. Thank you four your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . I'd like to do just a little housekeeping before I get onto some of the issues. As you all know last week I asked Jessica -- who I have no problem calling her a doctor if she properly identifies herself as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 physical therapist out of respect to friends and physician s that attend to my needs, your needs and everybody else. I think we need to honor them and their profession . And in her profession , most MDs, especially orthopedics send you to physical therapy after you've had surgery and all. It's an admirable profession to be in. And I respect her for that. I just want her to identify to everybody watching here that she's a physical therapist and be damn proud to be one. And that happens and she puts it behind her name, I have no problem calling her doctor. She's entitle d to it. She's earned it. But out of respect to the profession , she needs to respect them as well. And the solicitor had made a comment . I didn't really hear it when I walked out last week that she has a right to call herself doctor. I don't think at any point in my dialogue last week or what I present ed here I said anything negative about calling her a doctor. I even addressed that I have no problem calling her a doctor when respect -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 if she respected the profession and respected us and just put behind her name -- I was willing to pay for the name plate. I'm not here to insult. I'm not here to do it -- but what's right is right. And out of respect for the medical profession , you wouldn't go somewhere where somebody says just doctor and have no idea what kind of doctor they were on the door. You would go to your orthopedic s. You go to your orthodontist . You know, you move on and you get things done. And that's what I wanted to say tonight . I think I'm not here to challenge or argue. I'm just asking respectful . We're the employers of everybody here. And we have a say in what goes on. And that's all I asked her to do. The next part is that the Mayor wants to bring a train here. Well, what are you going to do, bring a train here and go up to Nay Aug and run around the splash park? We don't have what we need to bring -- worry about a train here. I offered to buy the mall and put a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 mini casino in it. I couldn't get City Council or the Commissioners to write -- endorse a letter that we could give the Game Commission before they changed boundaries to put a mini casino in there, which we had every intent to do. That would have brought life to Scranton , real life, real money, and everybody would have flourished . But bringing a train here for what reason to spend millions of dollars is a joke. The other part, why don't we pave Lackawanna Avenue and finish it? It's the gateway to the city and it looks like hell. We should be doing that. We should be doing the things on West Mountain . You should take that property up there by eminent domain and put windmills up there that would generate power for the power company but give free electricity to the residents and businesses in this city. That's moving the city forward . That's giving us growth. That's giving us opportunities . The guy wants to put his stuff up there for solar panels, doesn't do us any damn good. We should be putting the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 stuff that benefits this city. I brought up when I was running for Mayor here a long time ago to put windmills up there and give the residents in this city what they're doing, not tax the hell out of them, give them something for being here. And you'll bring growth. You'll bring industry . That's what growth is all about. I travel all over the world. And I know what I'm talking about how to develop and build something . I don't play politics . I look at our growth for our children and their future. I'm offended by teachers in schools that are trying to impose on these kids their gender. We got to stand up and make a stand on it. Any teacher would do that to a kid has to be expelled from the school. Kids have a right to grow up on their own right. And it's our responsibility to take care of our children and not sit here and let these people get away with what the hell they're doing. I'm not here about sexual orientation , leave it in your bedroom but don't take it out on the kids. And that's our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 responsibility to take care of our future. Those are the kids. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . You could relax because I'm not going to attack the city tonight . I guess I'll tone it down and be more like Mr. Bolus. I was speaking to a friend of mine on the phone last week. He's a retired college professor . So we could take it he's a very educated man. And we were talking about he saw last week's, you know, meeting . And he mentioned something of merit as far as I'm concerned . He's concerned about so many no English speaking immigrant children . His theory is that they have no underlying education to start with and putting them in 4th grade, 6th grade, 8th grade, whatever , with no education to start with is such a hindrance that that's what the teachers are complaining about. That seems to be the problem . And he said if he had anything to do with the school board, he would urge them to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 have like a one-room school and start everybody at kindergarten or first grade level and make you work your way up. And that seemed -- seemed a very good idea to me to investigate anyway. These children , most of them at home, nobody speaks English . They hang around with people their age that don't speak English . They got a lot against them when it comes down to it. Then I find it infuriating to see Hyundai and other people -- companies have Spanish speaking commercials . This is America . These people are suppose d to assimilate . Believe it or not I want them to do so. Helping -- helping them to keep -- I was at the bank today to get some money. You have to poke English . Everything on the phone you got to poke. That's terrible . Our culture is gone down the drain because of a bunch of weaklings in government . Well, now that I got that out, real quick, my son used to watch on his computer a vehicle called Navigator Breakdown . I don't know if any of you ever heard of it, Navigator Breakdown . It's an expose' I guess of all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 these bleeding heart commercials you see every 15 minutes wanting you to give them 16 cents a day or 60 cents. It has a breakdown of what goes to run this society and what actually gets to the subject matter. It's unbelievable . They have taken bleeding heart Americans and just sucked them dry for big salaries . I used to give to one of those army things. And they showed some guy sitting in a bathtub in Vegas with a Martini or something . I never gave them. I gave $30 to the Boy Scouts to go to this camp. You know what happened with the Boy Scouts. This -- this Navigator Breakdown just -- it would change the way Americans are being taken for granted . And real quick I'm going to give a freebie for Boscov's. A lady asked me where I got my pants. They got a lining. They're Wranglers from Boscov's. And they are the best things in the world. They are just as warm and nice. And they cost about $20. I've been mad at Boscov's since they filed bankruptcy on us years ago. But that's a real bargain if you ask me. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Anyone else who would like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, I believe that almost a year has past, if not more since Council removed the sound ordinance s from the Liquor Control Board to the Scranton Police Department to enforce even though the Scranton Police Department lacked a decibel meter. Is there an update in data on the first trial year of Scranton 's enforcement of sound violations for bars? And are we going to return back the enforcement to the Liquor Control Board? Are we going to put forward for another year of the Scranton Police dealing with sound ordinances for bars? I understand Geisinger made a 23 million dollars purchase , all well and good; but I'm more concerned with the hospital mergers . When you now have all hospitals under one roof, plain and simple it's a monopoly . How can you have choice in healthcare when there is one healthcare ? Has our city's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 healthcare employee evaluated the impact of a one hospital network for the residents of this city? I understand we'll be having a public meeting on 1/26 on the new zoning. It's to be reintroduced on 1/31. It was my understanding that changes from the Planning Commission have to go to the county first. And then once approved will come back to the city. If I'm in error for that, please let me know. As far as I know that as of today though, we have an agenda out front that says we're going to have a meeting in two days. The next meeting listed on the city's website was for January 26th with the agenda of to be announced . City Planning Commission is still listed as their meeting s are live-streamed on ECTV. And the last available meeting on ECTV was April 14th, 2021. Are there meeting agendas and minutes for this body anywhere to be found? Next, how is it when we need people for an unpaid position on boards the city has a multitude of eligible resident s who could fill 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 unpaid slots. But when there's a paid position , the citizens of Scranton are suddenly stupid and substandard . And to protect the city from the population we must hire outside the city and would give waiver grants. I don't understand how when it's a free thing, a free job, city resident s are fine. But it's when it's paid, sorry, we don't have competent people here. We're now heading -- I passed this forward to Council President . It is a security assessment report. We're now heading at this point into $340,000 Scranton could have saved if they had listened to my advice in the end of 2019. Being proactive and strengthen IT control s and audits. It's been said the issues related to Ransomware Scranton that was hit -- that it was hit by was fixed. Has Scranton hired and received reports from any third party system organization control groups? There are specific groups that are hired to do penetration testing to audit systems and to make sure they're secure. We've already been hit once. And once these are done, direction s are put forward 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 and a report is put forward to the public. These are from major companies that actually do this as their job. Has Scranton ever had a third party do an audit of our system or are we just letting it up to the IT Department and those in charge to say everything is fine now. That costs us $175,000 on the insurance per year as an increased cost. And last on the parks, it does say in the revenue that goes to impacted or disproportion ately impacted communities . But for governmental services it says that is not the only guideline . There is discretion in there. And since pool services , exercise and obesity and weight loss who are major factors of COVID-19 under the federal guidelines in the April 21st ruling, they were specifically added in as items that could be used for that because of the negative impacts of healthcare of bad health is on the partici pants and that's what the funding was for. I'll retouch that next week. Thank you very much for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. STUBS: Good evening , Council members . My name is Gary Stubs. I reside in the 1500 of Pine Street. Thank you for your time this evening . I rise in strong support for permit parking on the 1500 block of Pine. I lived on the block for approximately four years. I was born in Scranton , lived in the area, a few areas in Scranton . I lived on this block now for four years. First couple of years it wasn't so bad. Things got congested . Houses got filled up, people not on the block that are parking there that do not reside there. And basically tensions flared. Okay, I saw this more and more and more. Police were called several times. There was an act of vandalism . I decided -- and by the way, we have some of this on camera if we go back and research dates and everything that we took record of. And I realized , you know what, from my vision Scranton is a small quiet city. I want to keep it that way. Okay, we're not the type of city that has big problem s that the big 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 cities have. I care about the city. And I want to play my part to maintain a certain degree of peace and quiet. I want to go to work and come home and just spend time with my wife, not listening to fighting the street over petty nonsense . But the police have been called several times. And my understanding is that so I believe the question has been posed a few weeks ago, does this set a precedent and my understanding is that normally there's a business on the block when there's an inspection to determine whether or not it fits criteria . There's no business on the block. But it was determined that it fits criteria . And from my vantage point it doesn't surprise me. I've seen petty little conflict s. I'm not interested in it. I don't have the time for this. Okay, I want to focus on what really matters and not be bothered by this. And you know what, out of respect for the Scranton Police Department , I don't think they need to be bothered with this. I'm not a police officer . I don't know what goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 on with crime and so on. However , my guess is there is bigger issues to focus on than petty fights over parking . And when I see this tension building and building and building, it's like I see a fuse burning . And I want to play my part to step it out before there's a big problem and not wait for a big problem and now how do we pick up the pieces. I try to play my part in parking sometimes . When there's parking available I would go a block away. Let me save space for other resident s so I'm not contributing to that tension . I want peace and quiet on the block. And this is nonsense . Like I said, I don't think -- I believe there is a certain degree of childishness to it. And the police -- out of respect for the police, they don't need to be bothered by this. They could focus on bigger issues. And that's why I supported back in I believe March I went around the block, 12 households out of the 16 supported the proposition , two opposed and two no answer was the latest numbers I have, 75 percent sound likes a pretty high 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 percent . Again, let's keep things small, quiet. Let's be proactive . Let's solve this problem before it becomes a bigger problem . And basically within the last ten months there's been a few conflicts . Now granted , you might say, you know, Gary, it's verbal arguments . We live in a day and age where people get very easily quote/unquote whatever the word is, angered , enraged . I don't want to hear it on my block. I want piece and quiet. That's usually what I've experience d in Scranton . I'm very thankful for that. It's one of the things that I like about Scranton is that it's not New York City. It's not, you know, big, quiet, angry, etc. Okay, it's calm, peaceful . I want to keep it that way at the very least on my block. And I honestly believe -- maybe this is a -- sounds like an extreme thing to say, but I don't think this is really about the block. I think this is about the community at large. And frankly , I would go so far as to say it has an impact on the entire city. Why, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 because I come back to that point that I would imagine there's more important things to worry about than childish fighting over the parking on our little block in the Hill Section . Let the police focus on bigger issues that are more important . And the way to do that is permit parking . Why, because again, clear out the people that are not supposed to be parked there that park there on a regular basis. There's ample room for everybody. Nobody's frustrate d, peace and quiet and you focus on bigger issues. So I just wanted to present my side of the story because I know that a few voices have been presented on the other side of this debate so-to-speak. I believe I'm speaking the silent majority . I believe , you know, the loudest voice is not always the most voice, right, the majority . I'm voicing the opinion of the way that a lot of people on the block feel and see I'm running short on time. I could go on. Basically that's the gist of why I believe this is the correct thing to do. And I thank everyone for giving me the time to speak. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Stubs. MR. SCHUSTER : Now, Mr. Stubs, hang on one second. I don't know if you realize there was a hearing today for this specific issue at 5:45. The fights that you spoke of, are they between residents or they're between residents and nonresident s? MR. STUBS: People on the block. MR. SCHUSTER : So they are between residents . MR. STUBS: Yeah. We have some of those conflict s on camera. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, so it's not people that are visiting homes, anything like that that are parking in spots. It's other residents of -- MR. STUBS: There are people that visit. But the conflict s that I've seen have been people that live on the block. MR. SCHUSTER : That live on the block, okay. Thank you. MR. STUBS: Thank you. MR. KING: Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , resident of the city and taxpayer . I was disappoint ed when I read that only 85 percent of the property owners paid their entire property tax last year. It seems to me it used to be in the lower -- at least lower 90s. Does anybody -- maybe, Mr. Schuster , do you have what the -- it's been for the last three to five years? MR. SCHUSTER : So what the previous paid in full percentages were? I don't have that offhand . I could look into it though. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I would like to hear that. Of course I would have to do a right to know if you don't want to do it. And now what do we know about the policy and demolition in this city that we didn't know last week? Nothing ? Do we know when that mostly empty apartment building -- oh, I'm sorry -- MR. MCANDREW : (Inaudible .) MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, and where the transparency is. How many -- MR. MCANDREW : We just received it today. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MS. SCHUMACHER : Was it in Third Order? I missed it then. MR. MCANDREW : We just received it today. So we'll have it put in Third Order. It's a total list of properties that are to be demolished and then the second piece is the criteria for that. MS. SCHUMACHER : And does it have the priority of which one is -- MR. MCANDREW : I don't know if the list is listed in priority . But I do know that the criteria is clearly -- I was interested to read more about it. We just got it. But you'll get it too in Third Order next week. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Do we -- well, can you just look at it quickly and see when the date is for that apartment building on Harrison Avenue right after Duffy when you're coming to from Moosic Street to Mulberry ? MR. MCANDREW : I don't know if I can -- well, we can get it to you. It's a pretty big list. It's a large list. I don't want to waste your comments . MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, okay. And how about an update on what's the status of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 land bank? Who on this building -- on the committee goes? Do we have any statistics on how many? Have we put any more properties into the land bank? How many has the land bank sold for us in the City of Scranton ? MR. KING: We'll have to look into that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And I read in the paper this last week about the committee that you and the Scranton School District are going to have on hiring I guess diversity -- I could not understand . Are all of you -- each of you are going to be on this committee ? No? MR. SCHUSTER : I am on the committee . I don't know how the setup of the committee goes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Will the meeting s be in public? MR. SCHUSTER : The meetings are via Zoom. There was one Monday. Previous meeting s are schedule d while I'm at work. So I haven't had an opportunity to attend. I think there was two or three prior to that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, darn, I missed it. And then I know it's only a couple of days 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 out of the year, but somebody needs to talk to the University of Scranton . I came up Mulberry Street today. And, of course, this must be the day the students are coming back from their month off. And the entire, entire lane going up toward Harrison Avenue from Jefferson was just a parking lot with lights flashing because they were going to be there for a while because they were bringing students back, which meant if you were coming up the hill you had to go into the opposing lane that you are not suppose d to be in. And I'm sure the University of Scranton could do something better when the students come back to get those cars. And then can you find out how many pedestrians have been ticketed in the year 2022? I mean -- okay. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . Mr. Voldenberg , can you send something down to the Scranton Police Department to check on those statistics concerning pedestrians ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . Now, once again it's been mentioned many times I think there are three deaths that I remember at the corner of Wyoming and Lackawanna . And somebody was hit there just a couple of days ago. The sun gets in your eyes. I've driven there and all of a sudden there's a person in front of your car when you make the turn. So what I thought of was a sun shield up there on the top of the mall. At certain times of the year the angle of the sun hits your windshield and all of a sudden you make the turn and a person's standing there like they came out of nowhere . Okay, 6-A, I had a little idea sitting down there. Before we adopt any further heavy-handed quality of life, I think somebody should be given a warning . You know, with OSHA if they're called in, they give a warning . They stop at the plant. And they stop citating people in the 80s outright even though they may have been damn well aware that they're in violation of safety codes -- occupational safety code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 So before there's a fine and a lot of consternation , if it's a first time deal somebody should stop by and say, hey, it's time to get rid of that car or something . And if they are back in a couple of days and the car is not gotten rid of or no explanation is offered , then the fine would be appropriate . Once again I'm on the taxes here. And I put a little jot down. I always felt that pilots were a good way -- they could laugh at us when we walked out the door, not necessarily the people that would be paying the pilots. But they're voluntary . And I feel the bigwigs in Harrisburg and the powers that be, they just offer this as a solution . And it's not really a solution because you have no right to demand money out of anybody that is tax exempt. And it don't matter who they are. It could be General Dynamics . They're tax free. And it could be a museum. They are tax free. A hospital , they're tax free. A college or university , they're tax free. So at any point they're just almost laughable . Whenever I hear somebody -- some financial advisor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 coming in like Mr. Amoroso or Mr. Cross or -- and he talks about pilots, it's like shut up already . Forget about it. We got told there's two Council people went to Scranton University and asked for an increase in pilots. And they got treated like they were trying to fill their trunk up with cash or something . You know, it was really disgusting . I was very mad at the university at that time. And once again, I'm going to get on the dump up there. I would hope that if they're watching or come across that the people that were involved against the expansion would not -- would get involved again over this reverse osmosis and discharging dump water into the gorge. I mean, it's -- our regulatory commissions I just have to give them like a D or a D-plus including the PUC. I just got my electric bill. And as of the first of the year it's up like 30 percent . You know, nothing like wiping out a raise and then some. Thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Is there anyone else that would like to be heard by Council ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: I have one comment . Nay Aug Park community room, the meeting room in the back is ready for its heating system to be installed . It was purchased -- all the material and equipment was purchased by the Recreation Authority . They bought all that stuff. The City of Scranton , I went down and filed for a permit for that. They don't charge for the permits because it's a city property . Myself and other volunteers will be up there installing the heating system. I know I said when I did the interview here that I would not work for the city. This is not working for the city. This is 100 percent free. There is no money exchanged at all. This is just to install it for the park. I made this commitment last year. And I'm going to live up to it. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 that is all. MR. KING: Thank you. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Two issues tonight . Council did receive a phone call yesterday about 1102-1104 Dartmouth Street. The resident had a lot of different complaint s about that. I put it into the police department and also Eileen Cipriani at Code Enforcement , LIPS. We did get a response back and they are working on it. So thanks, Frank, with any help with that. Another one, I brought it up in caucus tonight . And it is January . I guess we're in the middle of winter. We have a storm coming tomorrow . But to be proactive , I had mentioned giving an update on the pools for the spring into the summer. So after the meeting tonight , I'll send out an e-mail and I'll add you on that, Frank, to get communication s started with Parks and Rec about what the pools look like for the summer if anything needs to be done and what the update is as we move into the warmer weather . So it might be a little off center with the storm coming but we should be proactive . That's all. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple things. I want to report out on questions that I posed over the past couple weeks. Before that, Mrs. Schumacher asked for the demo list. I know we're going to put it in Third Order. I know you're concerned about one property . Mr. Voldenberg -- does Mr. Voldenberg have your e-mail? I'm sure he does at this point. MR. VOLDENBERG : I do. MR. MCANDREW : So would you just please e-mail her the list and then the criteria I made mention of. So you'll get it before next week in Third Order, okay? Are you good with that? Good. All right. So past couple weeks I asked about the status of the pocket park. So I received an e-mail I'm happy to report out that the initial RFP responses were in excess of the grant award. So this is from Leslie Collins of Scranton Tomorrow . So our team went back to the drawing board and the project was rebid. We do have both a general contractor and a landscaper 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 which meet the criteria . Scranton Tomorrow is also working with PADCED regarding the contract expiration which was June 22nd, a very tight timeline . We're pleased to notify you that the state has officially extended the grant deadline . With that said, we have all intent on the park construction beginning in early spring starting with the clean fill, the land prep and being complete d in a timely fashion . Also, the finalize d contract with PADCED have been received and we're now able to formally enter into the contracts with both the landscaper and general contract or letters to be forth coming to all respondent s. So we'll keep our eye on that and make sure we follow the timeline . All right. Next, the Weston Field pool issue with the lifeguard we've been talking about since before the holiday s. We asked last week to have the director provide us with an update. We know that they were looking for them before the holiday . They were interview ing. So what we received from Director 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Duffy is, unfortunately , our recent lifeguard application s did not pan out. One did not a have a lifeguard cert and one was not interested in obtaining one and the other never respond ed or came in when scheduled . So we have a monthly schedule posted with a guard on each day whether in the morning or evening hours. We do accept fewer morning swim sessions -- I'm sorry, anticipate fewer morning swim sessions in February due to the availability of morning guards. Evening guards are made up of students who are available in afternoon s and evening s rather than morning s. We have more adult guards signed up for our March certification to help with the morning sessions . So we're glad to hear that. We have someone working on marketing materials to be posted on our platform s and shared throughout our outreach channels . This will have all the information needed to apply and register for a course. They're offering free certification courses in March, April, and May which is great. This is to recruit and hopefully retain. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 We have applicant s at each session so far. We'll share this information publicly once marketing chairs are completed . We'll host a recertification for our current guards who need the refresher course to renew their certifications . We have 20 current lifeguard s, mostly high school, college students and two adult seniors . They usually work the morning sessions . So I know the resident s and the slash customers of Weston Field -- the pool watch these meeting s. So I hope this is information that you're pleased with and we'll keep you updated . And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few items. Followup for Doris Koloski , Steve Teaman{phonetic } from the DPW supervisor reviewed the corner of Olive Street and Colfax Avenue on January 19th for handicap curb completion . And he will be advising Council soon as to how to get that resolved . Mrs. Schumacher , there were two items; one Mr. McAndrew address ed about the demo list. And the other was Seymour Avenue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 drainage issue is under review by DPW at this time, okay? Mr. Ellman, City Code Enforcement is going to investigate 57 East Parker Street for a report of use as an illegal boarding house. So they're going to be looking into that as you had reported to the Council . I'm also told that ECTV will be live-streaming upcoming Planning Commission meetings . So we can look for that. Also, I met with the Mayor today through Zoom and Jack Reager who is the head of IT for the city, you know, he -- I express ed the concerns of the citizen s and myself as a Councilman about trying to update the website as quickly as possible . He had indicated that that's a priority and they're hoping to be able to do that within, like, a 48-hour period. The one thing like the DPW contract that was mentioned by Mrs. Hodowanitz , it's my understanding -- I'm familiar with this in having contract s in the past when I was superintendent to former school district s, Scranton and Lakeland . Once contract s are settled , there's a process that happens after that where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 language is typed up. And then it's kind of passed back and forth to check and double-check to make sure that all of the language is exactly what was legally bargained . And I believe that the contract is with DPW right now for them to finalize the -- for a final review. Once that's finalized , it will be -- it will be posted up on the website Mr. Reager indicated to me. I also asked Mr. Reager -- I know they only have three people that work, you know, in the IT Department . But there's a multitude of activities and jobs that they are responsible for. He realizes the importance of keeping that website updated . I also asked him to try to provide me with the list of some of the key initiative s that they're working on in the IT Department so that we as the citizen s and Council can be completely aware as to what's going on in that department . So he said he would get me some information on it, some of the things that they're working on in IT. Also, I know that Mr. Ellman mentioned about student s, English language 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 learners . Having been the former superintendant in Scranton I know that we have a large percentage of students that come from all over the world quite frankly . And I think that our teacher s do an outstanding job at educating student s who come from everywhere from Nepal to Venezuela , Haiti. We have student s that come from Russia, all over the world. You name it. There's like 37 -- probably 37 to 40 different languages spoken in the Scranton School District . I also know that the younger we could get those students the quicker the timeframe is for students to assimilate and learn the language . And Mr. Ellman is right that a majority of these students English is not spoken in their home which is why it's important for them to be fully immerged in the classroom with English speaking students . And we have English language learning or ESL teacher s that work with these student s in the classrooms . My wife probably has seven or eight different languages spoken in her kindergarten class of 25 or 26. I will tell you, those kids learn and they learn the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 language . And they end up being quite successful , I'll say. I remember I had a student at South Scranton Intermediate School when I was the principal down there and we had a student come in from Venezuela , did not speak one word of English . She is now a general manager of Citizens Bank locally here. So I welcome students . I welcome citizens from all over the world in this city. I want them to feel welcome here. They belong here. They add to diversity of our city. And I believe that our school district does an excellent job at working with these student s and families . I will tell you this, my wife and other teachers in the city, they have website s that they use to call to translate for the parents so they could help their own children with homework and things like that and to really when letters have to go home to help interpret the letters into various languages so the parents could fully understand because I don't care, parents care and love their kids no matter what country they're from. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 And as long as they're in the City of Scranton they're welcome to be here and we want them to be here and we want them to absolutely assimilate and learn the language and be successful . I think when given the opportunity through our educational system they could do that. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
