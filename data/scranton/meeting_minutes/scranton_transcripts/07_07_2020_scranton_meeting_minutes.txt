MR.

Let us also tonight take a special moment as we have for the last few months of silence for people in our community and throughout the world who are suffering or who have passed away from the coronavirus . Let us think about them and their families at this time that they may find peace. Let us think now about the doctors , nurses, researchers and all medical professionals and first responders who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process , may they find protection and peace. Whether we are home or abroad, surround ed by many people suffering from this illness or only a few, let us stick together , endure together , mourn together , persist and prepare together .

CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM CITY PLANNER DATED JULY 1, 2020 REGARDING PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO ZONING ORDINANCE FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? I just want to briefly mention I had a chance to read the Mayor's letter to the DEP on the expansion of the landfill . And I appreciate her coming out against it and issuing a letter to DEP. And I think it is very powerful that you have not only the City Council but you have the Mayor of Scranton as well joining together with the Council of Dunmore and other councils 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 throughout the county and public officials throughout the county who have stepped up to say very loudly and very clearly that we do not want to see the expansion of the landfill . So it's my hope that when you have Senator Casey, when you have Congress man Cartwright , other elected official s step up in this community that DEP will actually take those seriously . So again, I want to thank the Mayor for issuing that letter. Anyone else have any comments on the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I do. When looking at 3-E, we have an amendment to the zoning ordinance for the floodplain . And in that correspondence it says some of the maps have been changed . Do we know how much -- how much change has occurred with the floodplain maps or have any of the flood plans changed ? MR. GAUGHAN : That, I don't know, Councilman Schuster , off the top of my head. But that would be a question for Mr. King, the City Planner . I do know the Law Department is in possession of the draft ordinance to update the floodplain or the zoning ordinance , rather.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 So we're probably going to see that. I don't know if it will be before the recess but definitely I think before the end of the year. But Mr. King would definitely have the answer to that. MR. SCHUSTER : Do you think we should ask for it or do you think we'll get it coming up? MR. GAUGHAN : You can certainly ask for that. I do think we'll get it. But if you want to pose that question to him, I'm certain that he would -- he would have the answer. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I do. I have a couple. So, Tuesday , July 14th, Friends of the Poor, Family to Family and Weinberg Food Bank will be hosting a COVID-19 emergency walkup shoppers choice food giveaway at St. Luke's Episcopal Church on 232 Wyoming Avenue in Scranton , PA from 1 to 4 p.m. Also there will be a limited free 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 deliver y to downtown resident s. As always, please note zip code, number of children , adults and elderly in the household are required . Secondly , Penn Foster, which is a local business here, Penn Foster Social Impact Committee is looking for local or remote volunteer opportunities to provide to their employees . Each employee gets one paid volunteer day per year. They encourage their employee s to participate . They would like this information by this Friday. I know that, you know, there's not a lot of opportunities to volunteer because of COVID. But, you know, I'm reaching out to my colleague s or citizens out there that know of any opportunities you could e-mail me at MMcAndrew @scrantonpa .gov. Thank you. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Anyone else have any announcements ? MR. DONAHUE : I just have one, not an announcement but just a reminder that garbage and recycling pickup is one day behind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 this week due to the 4th of July holiday . And recycling is cardboard this week. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Anyone else? Okay. At this time I want to make one announcement and usually we do this in the caucus. But it is very important . We didn't have a chance tonight because we had PEL in. So there was a meeting today with officials from all over the county regarding recycling . And Solicitor Hayes had the opportunity to attend that meeting . Last week we had requested that Solicitor Hayes attempt to secure a copy of the current recycling agreement and provide an analysis regarding it. So, Solicitor Hayes, would you mind providing an update on that? Oh, sorry, Kevin, you're muted. ATTY. HAYES: Councilman Gaughan , and Members of Council , so on June 10th, 2002, Scranton City Council passed a resolution authorizing the City to enter in agreement with the Lackawanna County Solid Waste Management Authority in order to participate in the disposal of recyclable materials . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 The agreement was entered on September 19th, 2002 for a 10-year term. And accordingly , the agreement expired in 2012 and no subsequent agreement has been located . So the first question that I can -- the first answer I could give you is there is no current agreement in place between the City of Scranton and the Authority . However , I was able to secure the -- a professional service operating agreement which was entered on May 3rd, 2006 between the Lackawanna County Recycling Center and the Lackawanna County Solid Waste Management Authority . And according to the Department of State, the Lackawanna County Recycling Center Inc., was a registered corporation with Louis DeNaples identified as its president and Dominick DeNaples identified as its vice president . The purpose of this agreement was to engage the operator to manage the Lackawanna County Recycling Center which as you all know is located at 3400 Boulevard Avenue in Scranton , which is owned by the Authority . The initial term of this agreement was set for five 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 years starting on May 3, 2006, expiring on May 3, 2011. Thereafter , the agreement was automatically renewed -- would have the ability to be automatically renewed for four additional five year terms under the same terms and conditions unless the operator notified the Authority that it wished to terminate the agreement at least six months prior to the expiration of the existing term. So the agreement provides for additional terms up to 2031. It appears that its current term would expire on or about May 3rd, 2021. The agreement provides that the operator should use its best efforts in the management and operation of the Recycling Center so that its services would be operated and maintain ed in an efficient and business like manner to maximize the capacity to accept, process and market recyclable commodities . The Authority is required to use its best efforts to provide the operator with the same number of prisoners from the Lackawanna County Prison that have historically worked at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 the Recycling Center as part of their Work Release Program as long as security requirements are provided . Lastly, the operator warrant s and agrees that during the term of the agreement , any renewal or extension thereof , the Recycling Center shall continue to accept the recyclable commodities currently being accepted at the time of the agreement , that being May 3, 2006 and that the pricing level in effect on March 24, 2005 or as modified by the Authority . So that's just a high level overview of that agreement between the Authority and the operator which is known as Lackawanna County Recycling Center, Inc. MR. GAUGHAN : Now, Solicitor Hayes, I understand that there was a meeting today with county representatives regarding the change in the county's recycling program . Can you -- and you attended that meeting today. Do you have any updates with regard to that meeting ? ATTY. HAYES: Sure. Yes, I did it upon Council 's request . I attended today's meeting with representat ives of the county, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 specifical ly representative s from all municipalities were requested to participate in today's meeting so that the county could provide an update on its current recycling program . Along with myself, DPW Director Tom Preambo and Acting Solicitor Joe O'Brien were also there for the City. The county officials reported to the municipalities that there will be a change in the Recycling Program which is brought on by current market conditions as well as the COVID-19 pandemic , specifically the current pandemic has caused the county to suspend the program of sending Lackawanna County Prison inmates to work at the Recycling Center. It is my understanding that that -- I shouldn 't say suspend . It's been terminated because they're not going to resume it even if we were in the clear and the pandemic was no longer a factor. They're not going to reassume that at any point in time. As a result, the operator of the Recycling Center has reported that it will need to hire addition al personnel to fulfill the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 duties which were being perform ed by inmates. I know Councilman Schuster had asked me to find out what percentage of the workforce was comprised of inmates. I did ask that. And I was told that it's the majority , specifically it's the inmates are routinely assigned to handle the commingled recyclables . It's in the range of 12 to 22 inmates. None now, but that what was typically in place prior to our current situation . So as a result, the operator has made the determination that they are going to have to charge the municipalities for the receipt of certain recyclable materials . Specifically the operator issued a notice to the Authority which was dated Monday and indicated that effecti ve July 20 of this year -- so effective July 20 of 2020, municipalities will be required to follow -- to follow this fee schedule . At a rate of $40 per ton, the operator will accept commingle d recyclable s collected including clean non contaminated bimetal cans, aluminum cans, PET and LDPE and HDPE plastic along with glass, bottles , and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 jars all at a rate of $40 per ton, which will be billed monthly to the municipality . They also give the option that at $20 per ton, they would accept all of those commingled recyclable s except they will not accept glass, glass jars or glass bottles. The operator will continue to accept commingled -- will continue to accept newsprint, office paper and cardboard at no charge. In addition , if a resident wants to deliver commingled recyclable s that are free of glass, they could deliver those at no charge. But that's the program that has been -- that was -- that's the proposal that was issued on Monday. Now, today while this meeting was taking place, I got an e-mail message from someone at the county who indicated that the operator will honor this price and schedule commencing on July 20, 2020 and continue at a minimum through December 31, 2021, so until December of next year. And that municipalities will be billed monthly for recyclable s accepted at the center but the payment term is amended to defer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 payment -- the payment due date to the earlier of the receipt of grant type funding or January 30, 2021. So in other words, if there's grant -- the county seems to believe that there will be grant money available to reimburse counties . If that grant money is not available , you know, we would -- payment will be due on January 30, 2021. Lastly, they indicated that -- and this was an issue that was raised today by some of the other municipalities and by Tom Preambo I have to say. The county indicated -- or the operator indicated that the fresh yard waste, including leaves, grass clipping s, small trimmings that are delivered by municipalities to the center in biodegradable brown paper bags will be accepted for a two-month trial period commencing on July 20, 2020 and ending on September 18, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Now, do you -- sorry. ATTY. HAYES: That was an issue -- a major issue that was raised by a number of the municipalities that they are no longer accepting the brown bags which hold the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 clippings and the leaves. MR. GAUGHAN : Now, you indicated earlier that under the current agreement that the county was required to make its best effort to provide the operator with prisoners to perform work at the Recycling Center. Do you know why is this forming a basis for this change in pricing , which is being passed then onto the municipalities and the residents ? ATTY. HAYES: So that was an issue I raised at the meeting . You know, and I had read the agreement to say that as long as the county made its best efforts to supply the inmate workforce that was in place at the time of the agreement then they would be complying with the agreement . It was reported to me by the officials from the county that the majority solicitor had offered the opinion that by suspending the supply of inmate workers , that the Authority had effectively breached the contract and that it was now null and void. MR. GAUGHAN : Do you know who the board members are and who the Authority 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Solicitor is for the Solid Waste Management Authority ? ATTY. HAYES: So I met one of the board members today. The chairman was there. And his name is escaping me. I don't know the other board members . But I could tell you the Solicitor is Attorney Tom Cummings . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And is that Attorney Cummings who previously served as a Solicitor for the Borough of Dunmore when the borough approved the revised host agreement s with the landfill ? ATTY. HAYES: I believe it is. I believe that's the same Tom Cummings , yes. MR. GAUGHAN : And is that the same attorney who also acted as special counsel during the Scranton Sewer Authority sale and who was paid over $225,000 in connection with the sale? ATTY. HAYES: I believe -- I don't know what he -- I can't verify what any attorneys were paid as part of that deal. But I believe that Attorney Cummings was the borough solicitor -- Solicitor for the Borough of Dunmore and special counsel for that sewer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 deal when that all went -- when that all took place. So, yeah, I believe that's all the same -- same attorney , yes. MR. GAUGHAN : So just a few things. I won't spend too much time on this because I know we're still in the announcements part of it. And I wanted to get to this in the caucus but we ran out of time. But the information that you provided today, Kevin, first, I appreciate you attending the meeting . It is concerning . Seems to me like now the citizens of Scranton are going to have to pay for recycling because the Recycling Center can't use prison labor. I mean, to me that is what, you know, it just -- it does not make a whole lot of sense to me. And I think the arrangement needs to be scrutinize d very closely. So after looking at some of the documents that you had sent us, I would like -- and I'll make a motion to this effect tonight if my colleagues agree for you to draft a letter from the Council to the Board of Commissioners requesting confirmation on a number of issues related to the Recycling Center.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 First, I'd like for you to determine whether the May 3, 2006, is, in fact, null and void. Specifically , I'd like to know what is the basis for determining that the agreement has become null and void. Secondly , I would like to request confirmation as to why the Authority is permitting the operator to refuse to accept certain recyclable commodities which the agreement requires them to accept at the same pricing level. Also, I'd like confirmation that the Authority has obtained a legal opinion that the Authority has breached the agreement by its failure to supply prisoner s from the Lackawanna County Prison as workers for the Recycling Center. I'd also like confirmation from the Commissioners as to whether the Authority has issued an actual notice of default to the operator for failing to accept recyclable commodities which were accepted on May 3rd, 2006 at the pricing structure in effect on March 24th, 2005. I'd also like confirmation as to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 whether the Authority has taken an actual official vote to authorize the operator to amend the recyclable commodities which it will accept and the pricing structure in effect on March 24th, 2005. And I would like to know the names of all current authority members . MR. DONAHUE : I'll second that. MR. SCHUSTER : Same here. MR. GAUGHAN : So I'll make an actual motion tonight during the meeting . ATTY. HAYES: Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : That would be my comments right now on that. So thank you for the update. I do actually have a few other announcements if I may for a second. A public caucus will be held with Scranton Tomorrow , July 21st for an update on their activities . I know several citizens have requested an update from Scranton Tomorrow . So they'll be here July 21st. A public caucus will also be held Tuesday , July 28th with representat ives from NDC for the purposes of receiving our quarterly parking garage update. So they usually come -- they haven't been here in a while because of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 the pandemic . So they'll give us an update on what's been going on with the parking garages July 28th. I made this announcement last week but I just want to repeat once again that our July Council meeting s will continue to be held via zoom. Under Governor Wolf's orders, public meetings may continue to run remotely . Out of an abundance of caution as I mentioned last week, we're going to continue to face COVID-19 and follow the issues that go along with that. So we want to be as cautious and as careful as possible . So we'll continue to run the meeting s through Zoom until the end of July. We have an August recess. We'll reassess the situation going into September . As always, if anyone would like to comment on agenda items or City business , please send those comment s in writing to our City Clerk Lori Reed by e-mailing Lreed@scrantonpa .gov. Council will accept public comment until the day of our meeting , which is Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. And public comment is reviewed by the Council prior to our meeting and is placed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 on the official record and in the minutes of our meetings . Our agenda is being posted for public review the Friday before our Tuesday meetings . And the agenda and minutes can be accessed by going to the City's web page, www.scrantonpa .gov and clicking on the City Council page. Does anybody else have any other announcements at this time? Okay. Mrs. Reed, Fourth Order. MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Deborah Niehuus -- I hope I'm pronouncing her last name correctly ; Patricia Nestor, Marie Decker, Lenard Shoemaker , Marie Schumacher , Fay Franus and Mary Lorraine Craig. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll make a motion to accept public comment . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. There's been a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 second. On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , there were, you know, as in previous weeks a lot of comments regarding fireworks . Solicitor Hayes, we're waiting on what the state legislator is going to do and then all that legislation is going to be built into one in terms of increasing the fine and hopefully being able to ban the use of them altogether . But we're just waiting on the state legislator to pass that right before we get those down? ATTY. HAYES: Right. So, Councilman Donahue , the Senate overwhelmingly passed legislative bill that would allow certain cities which include Scranton to essentially prohibit the use of consumer fireworks within their limits by passing an ordinance or resolution no sooner than 60 days after the effective date of the legislation . So my understand ing is that the General Assembly is now on summer break so unfortunately -- so it still has to pass the House. It seems based on comment s by the Governor that he will be supportive of a legislation as he wants local control over the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 issue of fireworks . So once we have that we will have the ability to put serious restrictions on fireworks in the City of Scranton . And both myself and Solicitor Joe O'Brien are monitoring that closely . MR. DONAHUE : I just wanted to make the point of that that it's not like we're not acting. We're waiting for the state legislator to give us the authority to act so that we can act correctly and all in one piece of legislation . ATTY. HAYES: There's no sense in us passing legislation at this point in time when it essentially will be obsolete within a few months. So as soon as we have that bill in place we can act. And we will according to your directive . MR. DONAHUE : So I strongly encourage residents to reach out to both State Representative Flynn and Mullin to encourage them to support that legislation . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Anyone else on the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , in response to one of the questions we receive d in Citizens Participation and it's something too that was on the agenda that I missed in Third Order. And they'd asked regarding the updates from OECD for the COVID-19 grants, the business grants that were given. And there were many applicant s that were deemed ineligible . And they asked for the reasoning of that. And so those people did not meet the eligibility criteria , some of the basis criteria like owning your business within the City of Scranton , also not owing any money on taxes to the City of Scranton . So if any businesses are looking to still apply for the grants or the loans, please pay attention to the criteria that's there before you apply. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you so much. Anyone else on the question ? All right. All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Thank you. (Public Comment , the following are letters or emails submitted for public comment .) (Deborah Niehuus ) This is Deborah Niehuus writing to you. I realize I'm an hour late because I just now read the cutoff time for comments to city council . But I do wish to offer the following public comment , if possible : Something MUST be done regarding the out-of-control situation in at least parts of the city regarding the overuse and unlawful use of fireworks and other explosive devices . Recently an M80 exploded approximately 25 ft above me as it arced toward me while I stood in my garden. Somebody apparently had thrown it over the roof of my house. I suffered physical harm and trauma as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 result of this incident . In general , I am tired of my summer months being hijacked by people who feel the need to unpredictably unleash multiple rounds of explosives within a few feet of my property and myself. I should not have to endure this siege virtually every evening of the summer months. Please, for the health and safety of the residents of Scranton , stop talking about doing something regarding fireworks , and instead quickly devise a plan and promptly execute it. Wilkes-Barre has taken proactive measures to protect its law-abiding , peace-loving residents , NOT those who insist on making life a living hell via explosives . I see absolutely no reason why Scranton cannot follow suit. Thank you, Deborah Niehuus , J.D. (Patricia Nestor) Hello. I hope you all are enjoying your summer. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 I have two things that would you could help make mine better: 1. Could you open the indoor pool at Weston Field please? Pools have been allowed to open in the yellow zone. We are in green. Gyms are allowed to be open at 50% capacity . No excuse not to open. When I called, the lady didn't know when they would open. Sad face. 2. With the new cameras installed at Nay Aug gorge, could you open this live feed up to the public? YouTube Live, perhaps . With very little to do, we the taxpayers might enjoy seeing our dollars being spent as out of state losers catch citations . Thank you. Patricia Btw, Kyle, I hope you run for mayor again. (Marie Decker) I'm a resident of south Scranton and what has been going on with the fireworks this year has been disgraceful ,it has been since Memorial Day every night .there have been fires deaths , we cannot even live in our homes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 without fear of being burned down , we have no sleep or quality of life . We want something done , I pay a lot of taxes and I want to be able to enjoy some part of summer. Governor Wolf office said it is up to local officials to do something , so please do. Marie Decker (Lenard Shoemaker ) Hi, We are writing this letter with concerns over the amount of fireworks that have been happening in our neighborhood since Memorial day. The first thing is we need to ban The commercial grade fireworks , on the 4th of July we literally were frightened , they were shot off between houses with force that shook the house, We were afraid of catching on fire or being killed. No one should have to feel that afraid to live in the city. Please take this seriously and do what you can to ban the sale 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 and use of those very strong Fireworks . Sue and Len Shoemaker (Marie Schumacher ) COMMENTS & QUESTIONS FOR FOURTH ORDER OF 07 JULY 2020 MEETING . O Three week' ago Council member Rothchild reporting on a Meeting she held with members of the Administration noted an internal effort regarding the LIPS Department would be available in August. Last week in 3B the BA reported the Administration would not proceed with an approved Contract but would take in under consideration in next year's Budget so which is it? Were the issues that resulted in the now null and void Contract not as important as we'd been led to believe and, if not, why is the can being kicked possibly into 2022? Wouldn't revenue from permits increase if this issue was addressed now? O 3G in last week' Agenda provided the properties that would be addressed by the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 County Tax Assessor during the month of July. Who will be attending these Meetings for the City? O 3C of today's Agenda is a welcome Report from OECD on the COVID-19 grants. What were the top three reasons 42 percent of the applications where deemed ineligible and could we please have the numbers of grant applications and those receiving the grants by zip code? O In February 2019 the final approval for the 10-year LERTA program was achieved . In the subsequent 16 months there have been 12 applications granted . Is this the result you expected and what goal have you set for this tax reduction ? O Has the MS-4 permit application been submitted and, if so, will it be available in Third Order? When, if ever, will the HRG Contract Report be received ? Does the Administration and Council intend to kick the Stormwater program into next year or will it be addressed this year? O Is the 2019 Audit on schedule and will it be made available when received or will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 we have to wait for your return in September ? O Though a black eye is a nit compared to a death I believe the Look Out should have a police camera. It is a popular stop for many people to observe the City but activities and vandalism there also chase people away. O The Third Street truck traffic solution implies the City will begin enforcing the laws pertaining to weight and locations of truck be enforced ? Would you please obtain the number of ticket and the resulting fines and report them monthly ? O Prior to the Primary Election Mr. Schuster reported receiving a text from Ms. Gilmartin during the discussion regarding a letter she had received on the utilization of municipal building for voting. Please provide this letter in Third Order next week. O Mr. MCAndrew , I believe , reported Standard and Poor's kept their rating but gave a negative evaluation and I'd like to hear the meat on the bones of this negative assessment ; what did S&P see? O Lackawanna County provides 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Collective Bargaining Agreements on line as they are public records . When will the City's Labor Contracts be available on-line? O How many residents hold "commit" letters for City employment ? O When will the Capital Budget become available on line? (Fay Franus) Council members , I guess I should start begging , if not for my sake but for Emerson ''s sake. I have called the police at least 6 times and not once have they done anything . Soon, I will take matters into my own hands because I must. These fireworks have gone off FOR MONTHS--far before this virus-- in the same area--every single night-- I di not call on the 4th of July buy have called nightly every night before the fourth-- these people are not doing this for the 4th holiday this has been going on far before March--. It is coming from the project on Meridian Street near Jackson Street. This 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 project is up the road on the left from Burger King near the end of Meridian Street. -- I called that # you gave out--that is a recorded message --press #1 for this press#2 for that etc-- so I have been calling police dispatch 570 348-4141 they are the only one that answers -- BUT they have not once stopped these fireworks - they are in a residential neighborhood -- my God they are being shot off in that project --house house house house house -- I have to hold my hands over Emerson 's ears for hours-- you think that is easy--I have tv blasting air conditioner going but still BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM. How about all the other dogs whose owners just let them hide in fear? Two police cars are not enough. ATV drivers roared down the street the other night at 1 am-- everyone got woken up--it was like a ATV race-they kept circling the block and coming back again and again--the other day one flew up the street and flew right through the stop sign at Railroad and Broadway -- never stopped -- and again during the day 4 days ago an ATV flew down the street with another guy on a motorcycle -- they cut 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 this car right off --they pulled right in front of him going 70 miles an hour-- Something has to be done. That's all I have to say--please help us here-- As for as Emerson -- please know that if the police do nothing -- I am going to-there is no way I will tolerate this much longer. I know Jessica and Bill understand this situation very much-- and there is nothing we won't do for our "family" Thank you Fay Franus (Mary Lorraine Craig) We are in desperate need of an ordinance banning fireworks in neighborhoods . And it needs to be enforced . (End of Public Comment ) MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : With Citizens Participation , did we add the e-mail in there about the 1600 block of Sanderson Avenue and all the concerns that were sent in about that property ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, we -- I actually spoke to the gentleman who issued -- wrote the complaint . I spoke to him on the phone. And I know, Lori, you had sent that along to the Licensing and Inspections Department , correct ? MS. REED: Correct . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, that's been sent. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you. I was going to ask for that. And thank you, Mrs. Reed, for helping out with that phone call and also, Solicitor Hayes, for following up with my question about the recycling . That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 couple. So as Chairman of Public Safety Committee , I would like to applaud the Scranton Police Department and their detective s for the apprehension and arrest of the juvenile male for the homicide of the poor young lady that, you know, was killed in West Side last month. Great works guys. Secondly , it was brought to my attention by a few concerned citizens the activities occurring under the pavilion at the River Heritage trail on Olive Street that entail homeless people. There's fighting , yelling , cursing , urinating in public, drug deals going down and overdosing , a couple people. So, of course, I sympathize with our City's homeless population . But this appears to be a public safety issue that needs to be addressed or at least assessed by the City. So, Mrs. Reed, would you please send a letter to the City's administration , you know, to help try to rectify this situation for our citizens and get help -- the help needed for the individuals that are involved ? And thirdly , I would like to also 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 report on the motion I made two weeks ago, the hometown heros banner initiative . I have been in communication with the Mayor. And we'll be meeting with representat ives from the VFWs and the like in the upcoming weeks. I'd like to see this initiative through to recognize our own hometown heros and hopefully bring everyone in this City together during this process . And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just real quick, I just want to say that I'm happy to see in our legislation tonight the resolution for the -- for the fireworks . It's something obviously that was brought up several times over the past few weeks and that citizens are really concerned about and have been coming to us with just because of how dangerous they could be. It's really difficult to follow being -- orders to be 150 away from structures , especially in a city like ours. I know that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 it's been a torment in many of the neighborhoods , so just happy to see that we have that and looking forward to being able to enforce it better. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you so much, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Just to add to what Dr. Rothchild said about the fireworks and what, you know, a little bit of our discussion before that as soon as we are given the authority to act and to ban fireworks , I'm sure that this Council and the Mayor will, you know, sign that legislation . So it's important to reach out to your state representative s. And just briefly on this recycling program , the fact that they're going to charge us $40 a ton is pretty laughable to me. And I know that Council man Gaughan is going to make a motion to send correspondence to the County Commissioners . But I'd like to just make a motion to urge -- to send correspondence to the administration urging them to start developing specs in an RFQ and/or RFP to -- so that we can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 start exploring and shopping our options in terms of where we bring our recycling . I mean, if they're going to charge us $40, we might as well -- $40 a ton, we might as well see if we can get a better rate somewhere else. MR. MCANDREW : I'll second that. MR. DONAHUE : That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? All those in favor of Councilman Donahue 's motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. The ayes have it and so moved. Thank you. Anything else -- MR. DONAHUE : That's all I have. I mean, I have a comment on the Act 47; but I'll wait until that legislation comes up. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I have a few items. First, as Councilman Donahue mention ed and as we talked about in the first part of the meeting , I would like to make a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 motion at this time that City Council send a letter to the Lackawanna County Board of Commissioners requesting the following information : First, to determine whether the May 3rd, 2006 agreement is, in fact, null and void, specifically I'd like to know what is the basis for determining that the agreement between the Recycling Center and Lackawanna -- and the Solid Waste Management Authority have become null and void. Secondly , would request confirmation as why the Authority is permitting the operator to refuse to accept certain recyclable commodities which the agreement requires them to accept at the same pricing level. Third, confirmation as to whether the Authority has issued a notice of default to the operator for failing to accept recyclable commodities which were accepted on May 3rd, 2006 at the price structure in effect on March 24th, 2005. I would like to have confirmation that Authority has obtained a legal opinion that the Authority has breached the agreement 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 by its failure to supply prisoner s from the Lackawanna County Prison as workers for the Recycling Center. I'd like confirmation as to whether the Authority has taken an official vote to authorize the operator to amend the recyclable commodities which it will accept and the pricing structure in effect on March 24, 2005. And I'd also like names of the current authority -- current members of the Solid Waste Management Authority . Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , as I want to again thank Solicitor Hayes for attending this meeting . I was just made aware of this meeting a day or two ago. So, I mean, I don't know how that works to not let elected officials know or wait until the last second is to me unbelievable . As Councilman Donahue mentioned , you know, now that we're in the middle of a pandemic , we had our business administrator in a few weeks ago stating that we may have between a 6 to 10 million dollar deficit . The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Pennsylvania Economy League was just here showing that we may have deficits at the end of this year and for the next few years because of the pandemic . And now the Recycling Center notifies us and the county notifies us that the citizens of Scranton may have to start paying for recycling . And the reason the -- and, Solicitor Hayes, correct me if I'm wrong; but is it because -- is the reason they gave because they could not use prison labor? Is that the sole reason? Is there another reason that they gave that I missed? ATTY. HAYES: I think that there is ongoing issues -- market issues because of China not accepting recyclable materials as much as they used to. But I think the impetus of this specific action was the suspend -- or pulling back on the suspension of the prisoner program . MR. GAUGHAN : As I said, I would like this information from the County Commissioners . I think that this whole arrangement needs to be scrutinize d very closely . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 And I'm looking forward to getting answers to these questions quickly . Anyone else on the question ? ATTY. HAYES: Councilman Gaughan , I have to say the Director of the Recycling Program , Barbara Giovagnoli and as well as Chief of Staff Brian Jeffers, you know, they fielded all of our questions and stayed actually after the meeting and met with myself and Tom Preambo . And Mrs. Giovagnoli who is the Recycling Coordinator offered to come to any work session we have with any questions . She could probably give you a better description as what market conditions are -- may be impacting this agreement . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, sure. That would be great, Mrs. Reed, if you could set that up. In the meantime , I do think it's also important to get these questions answered in writing as well in terms of the actions that the Authority took. But, yeah, Mrs. Reed if you could reach out to her and set that up and if we can -- even if we have to schedule a special 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 caucus, I think it's that important . That would be great. Anyone else on the -- MR. DONAHUE : I would like to just expand on that for one second. First off, we do get grant money that comes in for our Recycling Program based on the amount of tonnage we do recycle . You know, if that has go towards , you know, paying some sort of tipping fee or fee to actually recycle , you know, that takes away from the -- what you could put into the trucks and the infrastructure that we have on our end. And then also on that point, I meant to mention it in Fifth Order; but just because we're not picking up recycling currently , doesn't mean that you can't recycle the aluminum or the glass on your own. If you were to take aluminum cans to a place like Fiegleman 's or any local scrap yard -- that number from Fiegleman 's, for example , will be sent to the City in establishing our total number of recyclables that determines our grant money. So it's not only the recycling that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 goes through the Recycling Center, it's also the ones that go around the local scrap yards as well that counts towards our grant allocation . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I just have something quick. You know, it's just ironic to me that, you know, now we got to pay for recycling to the same company that we pay for buses that didn't transport students during COVID. You know, I just -- I don't see the fairness in this. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion sending a letter, signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. The ayes have it and so moved. I just have a few other comments . First, I asked a few weeks ago for the administration to answer questions about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 NRS. I had specific questions that we had sent. I know that I spoke to Solicitor Hayes and those questions have not been answered to date. I do think it's important that we get answers to those questions . This is directly from a letter that was sent in May to -- actually May of I believe last year in 2019. So I think it's important to make sure that NRS has done all of the things the previous administration had asked them to do and provided all of the information that was requested at that time. So I'm still looking forward to the answer to those questions . Also, in terms of Third Avenue, it is now been I think three weeks, three and a half weeks since I met with members of the administration . I continue to stay in contact with the neighbors in that area. At the meeting it was promised that -- and basically an analysis or a report would be presented from the administration or written up from the administration with different parties who would add comment s from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 public safety to DPW, including the City Engineer . But it was going to be driven really by the administration . And we're still waiting for that. I'm also hoping and we were told weeks ago that we would have legislation sent down through the administration in terms of prohibiting brake retarders. I would like to see that prior to the August recess because every day that goes by, these people really can't enjoy sitting out in their yards, on their front porch and their quality of life has diminished greatly . And that's really unfair to them so if we can follow up on the Third Avenue stuff. And I did send an e-mail to the Chief of Staff. Yesterday I had the opportunity to go down unfortunately to Church Avenue and Oak Street. There was a very, very bad accident there with a young gentleman on an ATV who was very badly hurt and some of the neighbors were outside . And some of the comment s that I received and witnessed just standing there about the quality of life issues, the out-of-town landlords , the drug houses.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 One person told me that a very good family is leaving Church Avenue because of all of that, the blight problems . And it's extremely frustrating . I don't want to blame anyone specifically because this predates this administration and goes back quite some time. And I know that the current business administrator is working on some different proposal s and different ideas. I want to see and I hope to see an actual comprehensive cohesive strategy to deal with blight in the City. Since I've been on Council , the flame has been lit several times. One example is Ken Bond. Everybody gets up in an uproar and then it just falls to the wayside because no one is running -- no one is carrying the ball here. It continually , continually gets dropped . I've had the opportunity . I think I mentioned this a few weeks ago during the pandemic when there's really nothing to do to drive through really every neighborhood in the City. And there are pockets in different neighborhood s through the City that are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 severely , severely depressed and severely blighted . And they are only getting worse. And the City really needs to get more aggressive . It is -- I'm not telling anyone here anything that they don't know. It is not fair to the good families who keep their properties up. I do think we need to balance being very aggressive also with helping people who may need help cutting their grass if they're elderly, whatever that program looks like. But Councilman Donahue can attest to this. We've talked about this now for a long, long time. We've attended meeting s. We've attended work sessions with the previous administration . And again, the ball continues to get dropped . The fuse gets lit but then it fades away. I think what we need and I'm confident in Dr. Rothchild who is now the Chairwoman of OECD and I know who is working with the new Business Administrator that we're going to get some kind of consistent cohesive comprehensive strategy and program . Because I am getting concerned . I even took a drive through South Side, even 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 parts of Green Ridge, Minooka , North Scranton . And it's very, very concerning . We need action. I know we're in the middle of a pandemic . But, you know, we can't just sit around and wait for the pandemic to end. I don't know how long the pandemic is going to last. But we're losing good families who have the opportunity to move out. And that's always very frustrating . DR. ROTHCHILD : Councilman Gaughan , if I could respond to what you said just real quick? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure, if you could just hang on one second. I just have one more thing to add on the Church Avenue thing. There was several addresses that were given to me by the neighbors out there. So I am going to get in touch with Mrs. Reed and ask the administration , the Licensing and Inspections Department and the Police Department to see if there's anything that they can do to crack down in this area. As I said, it's -- the neighbors are honestly held hostage by what's going on out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 there. DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, just real quick, I just want say, you know, I do agree with all of what you just said. I did have calls earlier today with both the OECD Director , Miss Cipriani and I also had a separate call with our Business Administrator , Mr. Deeley. And I discussed these issues with both of them. And Mr. Deeley provided me with more updates . I wasn't able to attend the last meeting that they had this past week. And so things are moving forward . They're looking to set up a blight committee . They are taking these issues very seriously . They want to change, like, the whole process around how we take in these complaint s and then prioritize them. Even over the past weekend I received more complaints . I just -- instead of mentioning them during the meeting , I just sent them all to Mrs. Reed and spoke with her about them because there's just too many of them. So we do have widespread issues throughout the City. And I am looking to see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 when we can get Mr. Deeley into one of our caucuses so that he can explain more details about the work that they're doing. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you so much. DR. ROTHCHILD : And he did inform me that the LIPS Department did get some of their employees back. So -- and that was just last week on the third. I don't know if it's all of them within that department yet but definitely someone to be able to help with all the complaint s that are coming through that office. MR. GAUGHAN : That's great. Thank you very much, Dr. Rothchild . And as I state, I am hopeful with the new administration and everybody working together . But again, I'm -- I really want to see an actual comprehensive cohesive strategy to deal with these issues because it is -- yesterday really concerned me. And I've have been concerned for quite some time. So I'll look forward to those conversations . Also 913-915 Eynon Street, this is an issue that was again it was brought up at least a year or two ago. I hear now again yesterday from the neighbors out there that the house is still in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 the same shape that it was a few years ago. Nothing has been done according to the neighbors by the property owner. There's a terrible smell coming from the house. A year or two ago Judge Munley gave the owner a period of time to get the house up to code. And the ball has been -- apparently the ball has been completely dropped by someone . I don't know if there was no follow through , but the conclusion that I think everyone came to when this was brought up a year or two ago was that the house needed to be demolish ed. The gentleman was given time to rehab the house. Again, the neighbor s are stuck. The ones who pay their taxes who are again, good families who have lived there their entire lives, they get stuck holding the bag. So I know that several of the neighbors have contacted the administration with question s as to where this is at. And I did ask Mrs. Reed to follow up again with the Licensing and Inspections Department . It is really a disgrace . Newswatch 16 was out there a year and a half, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 two years ago. And here we are today and nothing has been done. Councilman Schuster brought up the 1600 block of Sanderson Avenue. Again, I spoke to the neighbor there within the last few days, major quality of life issues similar to what's going on on Church Avenue. So we did send that to the Licensing and Inspections Department . As for the fireworks , it's the worst since I've been on Council . Maybe in my lifetime it's the worst that I have ever seen with fireworks in terms of the number of calls that we received , the number of e-mails, the number of calls maybe to the police department . Just a guess, it might be due to the pandemic and that people can't get out to the different firework shows. It seems like everybody rushed out and bought fireworks and everyone put on a show at the same time on July 4th and even two weeks prior to that and there's still people blowing off fireworks . But I agree with all of the correspondence that we received , all the calls that I received . Something has to be done for our people living in our neighborhood s, for our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 veterans and the veteran that lives by me who actually stopped by my house and said that, you know, PTSD does come back when it's out of control . People could understand on the 4th of July. But two weeks before and a week or two weeks after is just unacceptable . People with pets, it's just -- and small children , it really is, it's unacceptable . I agree with Councilman Donahue and other Council people today who talked about and Solicitor Hayes Act 43 and the fact that that has to be repealed . And I believe now it's going to the state house. Senator Blake has been trying to help us out to give us control over what goes on in our City. Right now we're kind of -- it's really not up to us. So Act 43 preempts us from regulating consumer fireworks via a municipal ordinance . We do have something on the agenda tonight calling on the Commonwealth to reinstate the Fireworks Act of 1939. And I'm hopeful that it will increase patrols and increase enforcement that that will be helpful . So I think help should be on the way there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 I asked for an update from OECD on the walkability study. We do have legislation on our agenda tonight applying for a grant, like a transportation type grant. And I had asked the OECD Director . She told me at that time that they were researching the proposal by Mr. Speck. In reviewing the resolution they were unsure where the money was going to come from. I did put them in touch with -- the former Mayor Wayne Evans who was really involved heavily in the study at that time. So I don't think it's really gotten off the ground at all yet. But I'm hoping that now -- before the end of the year they'll have some kind of movement because I do believe the money is in place to get that done. I also requested today from the Controller , John Murray, the overtime report to see where we're at with the different departments . Also, Mrs. Reed, I know we've requested this before but we continually get e-mails from residents in terms of stormwater management and where we're at with the Herbert, Rowland and Grubic report that we were going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 receive at some point. So if you could just touch base with Mr. King and Mr. Preambo from the DPW on a status on that report, that would be very helpful . And that's all I have for tonight . Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 111, 2017 OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON ADOPTING AND IMPLEMENTING THE Act 47 EXIT PLAN FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON PURSUANT TO THE FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED MUNICIPALITIES ACT; AND AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO ISSUE AN ORDER DIRECTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE Act 47 EXIT PLAN AMENDMENT WHICH WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON ADOPTION ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT “A” IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF 53 PA. C.S.A. §11701.249, THE MUNICIPALITIES FINANCIAL RECOVERY ACT. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Is there a second?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I'm really interested to see the list from DCED on what they fund under Act 47, sort of do a cost benefit analysis in terms of what we gain and what we lose by staying in Act 47. But this current exit plan was passed about six months before I got on Council . But since I've been on Council , it's just thing after thing that we just -- and it's just going back to what the discussion just was. You talk about it but there was no action on it. Whether it's the Payroll Prep Tax, the OPEB Trust Fund, a debt service policy. The list goes on. So what's the benefit of it? I mean, we actually have to act here. Over 70 percent of the voters in last year's election approved the Payroll Prep Tax. And I'm just -- I don't -- if you look over the course of the last 28 years and you say, has the total affect of being labeled a distressed city, is that -- is that a net positive or is that a net negative ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 And I think you could make the argument that it's more of a net negative than a net positive over the course of 28 years. So I will vote to introduce tonight because I think this issue still needs to be debated over the next couple weeks. But as of right now, I can't in good conscience vote for an 18-month extension . I'd consider a 6-month extension due to the pandemic , but not 18 months. That's where I am for right now. And I look forward to having this discussion moving forward over the next couple weeks. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I echo some of Councilman Donahue 's remarks there. I would like to see this list where we're at when it comes to the pros of remaining in Act 47. And I do think the City and the other advocates for the Payroll Prep Tax do need to speak with the school district . I think that's kind of been left where it -- where the conversation ended several months ago. So, I mean, if the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 extension is to wait on the district , I think some people that have some of that, that real data that was promised during the last administration need to meet with the administration of the school district so the Scranton School Board does have that information to go over so they could make a sound judgment call on that as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? I have a comment . I'm going to be voting for this legislation to introduce and then for final passage to extend the City's stay in Act 47 for 18 months for several reasons . First, as everyone knows, we've been distressed under Act 47 for 28 years. According to our recovery coordinator , the City was set to exit Act 47 this July prior to the pandemic occurring . The pandemic occurred which obviously had a devastating affect on the City's finances . We saw that tonight by the presentation from the Pennsylvania Economy League and before that with our Business Administrator stating that we're potentially looking at between a 6 to 10 million dollar 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 deficit . Voting against the 18-month extension would hurt -- I believe it would hurt the City in several ways and honesty would really defy logic at this point. It would be similar to throwing the baby out with the bath water or being in the middle of surgery on the operating table and just getting up and walking out of the hospital . Every municipal ity in the state is in the same boat here through no fault of their own. Again, you could argue that act -- there are issues with Act 47 as a whole. I made that argument over the last few years. But to just want to get out of Act 47 for the sake of shedding the title of distressed status when we're in the middle of a pandemic doesn't make any sense. There are several reasons why we should stay in Act 47 for 18 months. One of the major reasons is the recommendation in our three year exit plan was a transition to a Payroll Preparation Tax and the elimination of the despised Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 The transition cannot occur if the City is out of Act 47. So if everyone on Council voted against this legislation to amend the exit plan and to stay in for 18 months to give us more time to make the transition , if we all voted against it, we would not be able to transition from the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax to the Payroll Prep Tax. This recommendation was put to referendum in the fall of November , 2019. And the people of Scranton overwhelmingly voted in favor of the measure . Again, if we were to vote against this legislation tonight or final passage, it would mean that the vote of roughly 70 percent of Scranton ians who have expressed their support for the transition would be negated . And it would really set up an unnecessary additional roadblock on the path of modernizing our tax system. The transition to a Payroll Prep Tax would do several things. Number one, it would encourage business development which we desperately need in the City. It would enable a more predictable 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 efficient collection of taxes which we also need. And it would expand the City's tax base to business es that are currently exempt from the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax. As everyone on this board knows and many people throughout the City, the current Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax has driven existing business es out of the City over the years and served as a strong deterrent for new business coming into Scranton . Have there been challenges in implement ing the transition specifically with the school district , certainly . There has been many challenges . I know in speaking today to Pat Sheridan and Carl Deeley, they have been speaking extensively with Mr. Laffey from the school district . Those conversations are ongoing. And I'm very confident that we will be able to make this transition . Eighteen months gives us the opportunity to do that. Without the 18 months, we don't even have the opportunity because we can't make the transition without being in Act 47. That is the law. So that would be really the main 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 reason. The second reason is, it's really an inopportune time to make any kind of a determination on the long-term financial position of the City in the middle of a pandemic with all of the adverse effects that it brings. Eighteen months should be enough time to work with the state officials and DCED to reevaluate our distressed status in the future when conditions have hopefully stabilized . The -- Councilman Donahue mentioned the six -- maybe doing six months. I don't -- according to what PEL said tonight , I don't even think that's possible according to the law. I think it has to be 18 months or nothing . I think 18 months, why wouldn't we do that? It gives us time to reevaluate everything . And it gives us time to make that transition from the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax to the Payroll Preparation Tax. So again, the positive s outweigh the negatives . If it's just about -- if it's just about shedding the -- shedding the title of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 distress ed, we've been distressed for 28 years. So, I mean, shedding it in the middle of a pandemic to me doesn't make any sense. I think for whatever benefits there might be, we should stay in. And I think we should do the logical thing and do the right thing for the citizens of Scranton . Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MR. DONAHUE : I would just like to make two real quick comments . I don't think it's just in terms of the ability again to just to shed the distressed status. I mean, there's a possibility that we lose 3.2 million dollars this year and 3.2 million dollars next year and triple LST. You know, that's one financial aspect I think that needs to be weighed . And it's not 100 percent one way or another. But it's still a possibility . And then in terms of payroll prep, I mean, we were in a meeting I think it was at the beginning of March right before this all hit. And we were -- we basically had set today as the deadline to have legislation in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 front of Council to go ahead with the conversion into the payroll prep from the Business Privilege and Mercantile . So it's not something that needs to take 18 months. And then if you wait a year, you're also decreasing your base number because that base number next year would have to be based off the collection this year. MR. GAUGHAN : Right. But if we leave we don't even have that -- if we don't -- if we don't take the 18-month extension , which I believe every other distressed municipality in the state is going to do, we don't even have -- we don't have that option. The option is totally off the table. I get what you're saying, Councilman Donahue . But, you know, to leave is to not even have -- then we don't have any option. I mean, we can argue over the semantics of hopefully they get it done sooner rather than later. But again, if we leave and we vote against this, then we don't -- that option is off the table. And as I said, 70 percent of the City said that they want to see this happen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 for all the reasons that I just mentioned . So you can -- MR. DONAHUE : So it should have been done already . MR. GAUGHAN : Right, but it's not. And again, if we leave Act 47, then we don't even have the option. So I think just from a logical perspective you would want to give yourself the option and have this new administration work with the school district to hopefully -- to hopefully get it done. But to leave, you don't -- the option is off the table, which I mean you're -- I think we would be putting a hurdle up in front of us that is just unnecessary . DR. ROTHCHILD : I just want to add, I understand how frustrating that this is for the City when we've already been in distressed status for how long. And to put it off for a longer period of time is the last thing that I would want to do frankly as well. But, you know, given what has happened with the COVID-19, we're in a very different place than we imagined we would be. And the 18 month extension I see it as not just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 being because of the hopeful transition to the payroll tax but because of the fear of there being a second wave but also the unknown as to what will happen in the next few months with revenue loss with the City if we get shut down again and we lose even more money. This is sort of the last thing on my mind as to exiting Act 47 because we're going to have some other priorities at that point to ensure the financial stability of the City. And so, you know, I think I'm more comfortable with the additional time for fear of a second wave and, like I said, fear of the unknown with our finances . We have estimates . But, I mean, those estimates can change. That's all that they are. So that's where I stand. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , do you have anything to add? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I'll be voting yes for the extension because of circumstances . But that doesn't mean I'm not happy with the process . You know, the length of Act 47, the regards to Payroll Prep Tax that was discussed with only a few people since 2015. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 When I was on the School Board, we weren't even include d in the conversation . But it was expected to just fall in place on the final hour, which I had problem with. And, you know, and I remember I had at least one meeting where I asked, well, why don't we phase it in like Pittsburgh did? And I was told by our Business Administrator in Scranton , I don't know that answer. Like I said, I'll vote for the extension because of the circumstances . But I'm not happy with the whole process . And I hope we don't have the same conversation 18 months from now where we're going to say, oh, you know, we need more time or we didn't do this because of that. All right? That's just where I'm at. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION - CALLING ON THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA TO REINSTATE THE FIREWORKS ACT OF 1939. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Is there a second? MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question just to reiterate , again, we've been kind of besieged by complaints from residents throughout the City of Scranton regarding the fireworks issues, not only on July 4th, but previous to that and even up and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 until today. I support this legislation calling on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to reinstate the Fireworks Act. It really will give us as a municipality more control over regulating the fireworks issues that we're having. And it will prohibit people from going out and buying these commercial grade fireworks which in all reality there should be a professional that is helping to blow these off. The second thing is that, you know, in the City, I believe you have to be 150 feet away from a building or a structure to blow off those fireworks . It's very hard to find an area in the City where you could be 150 feet away from a structure unless you are in the middle of the woods or in the middle of a baseball field. I think we have to look at that as well. I know Wilkes-Barre is taking some measure s that I think we might be able to look at. But I think the first step is to definitely call on our -- the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and our state legislature to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 on board and help our elderly people, our veterans who suffer from PTSD, people who have reached out to us who have pets that are not right for weeks after as we all know. And now this is something that is very serious and I think Council is making the right move here by voting on this legislation . Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Just to add to Councilman Gaughan 's statement about, you know, being 150 feet away. It is also illegal to set off fireworks on any City property . So any City park or City owned baseball field, that must be 150 feet away from any occupied structure is still illegal because it's considered City property . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, as we're having this conversation about to vote on this piece of legislation , I'm hearing some fireworks in the background just kind further away so I don't think you'll be able to hear them on camera. But, yeah, this has been insane. And it's all hours of the day and night. You know, it's really affecting people's quality of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 life. It's, you know, really difficult I think for veterans or people experiencing PTSD to deal with. You know, people are fearful for their homes if they're going to be set on fire by the nearby fireworks . So I am obviously in favor of this to be able to call on legislators . But I think we need help from the public to also contact their state legislators to repeal this act. And also, if people can remember to call the non emergency line, you know, that they might be thinking that well, someone else might have already called who was in the neighbor hood. But if someone hasn't, then the police might not be aware of it. And so if you are hearing them and if it's a problem , then make sure to call that line so that someone can get out there and at least give out a fine to whoever is setting them off. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 MR.

Or is the payroll tax conversion going to be part of that review? Do we know that? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't know for sure. I think that would be -- probably be included with that since they're talking about evaluating billing collections with the goal of increasing collection rates. But I'm not 100 percent positive . But I think that's something else that we can inquire about. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so if we can add that as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : You're welcome . Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 45, 2020 – ENCOURAGING THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO PASS LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL ASSISTANCE AND CALLING ON THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO ADOPT THE FUNDING ENHANCEMENTS TO THE FEDERAL MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGES (FMAP) AS PROVIDED IN THE HEROES ACT HR 6800. MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-F. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just want to reiterate two things here. I've spoken about this the last few weeks. I can't reiterate and stress how important it is for everyone who may be watching this Council meeting and anyone else in the City of Scranton to contact your State Senators , your State Legislators , your Federal Legisla tors, Senator Toomey, Senator Casey. Congress man Cartwright. We need to make sure that they understand that the citizens of Scranton if we don't get help from the federal government , your taxes are going to go up. Your city taxes are going to go up. School District taxes are going to go up. And quite honestly your county taxes will go up. And when I look at what's going on throughout the country , the airline industry is getting a major bailout. The travel industry gets a major bailout. All of these corporations and businesses are getting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 bailouts from the federal government . While cities like Scranton are left still with -- this legislation kind of still in flux is still being left out in the cold to deal with this problem by ourselves and that eventually if nothing changes is going to be transferred on the backs of the hardworking people of the City of Scranton . So I don't think that we as Scranton ians and we as elected officials are asking for a bailout. You're giving billions of dollars as I said to Boeing, to different companies throughout the travel industry . That's a bailout. We're asking for the federal government to reinvest the hard earned tax dollars back into our City to avert a financial disaster . We had our Business Administrator in three weeks ago. We're going to have a potential deficit between 6 to 10 million dollars . Money is not flowing from trees in the City of Scranton as everybody knows. It has to come from someplace whether we borrow or whether we have to increase taxes. And it may 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 be hard to understand the plight of the working middle class people when you're on your perch in Washington , D.C. But this is real life. All of us on Council have to make very difficult decisions . And staring down the barrel of a 6 to 10 million dollar deficit through no fault of anybody 's because of the public health crisis and then having to basically beg our federal legislators to include cities in this next round of funding is ridiculous . So I really -- what I'm saying is we need your help. We need you to contact your federal legislators . We need you to call them. We need you to e-mail them. We need you to write them. We're going to send this legislation to our Senators and our Congress men. Councilman Donahue and I were on the phone with Senator Casey's office who Senator Casey has been more than helpful and wants this funding to get to the City of Scranton . We need to convince our Republican friends like Senator Toomey to make sure that he does not leave cities like Scranton and our hardworking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 middle class citizens of Scranton out in the cold. So again, it's important . We're going to send this to them to make sure that they have it. I know the Mayor's requested a meeting with Senator Toomey. We have requested a face-to-face meeting with Senator Toomey to make sure that he understands and all of our Federal Legislators understand if we don't get the funding, it's going to be the people who suffer. And people are already suffering . So we don't want to add to the burden. We've been told, well, you got funding through the county. That's true. But it's for expenditures . It's the revenue where we're taking the hit -- where we're going to take the hit. So that's where we're going to need the funding . So again, we really need the people of Scranton to step up to annoy as much as you can our offices of our federal legislators and make sure that they understand that if they don't provide assistance, we are not going to forget and from now until this heros bill and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 it's hopefully passed, we're going to make as much noise as possible . Councilman Donahue , Councilman McAndrew , Councilman Schuster , Dr. Rothchild , we're going to do everything that we possibly can along with Mayor Cognetti to make sure that we're fighting on behalf of the people of this City because this pandemic is no one's fault. And we can't allow the travel industry and the airline industry to be bailed out with billions of dollars and then be expected to just raise people's taxes and have them pay for it when they've been paying their taxes their entire lives. So that's all. MR. DONAHUE : Just to add onto Mr. Gaughan 's point, local and state governments across the country make up about 10 to 11 percent of GDP. If there is any other industry throughout the country that was facing the financial hardships that state and local governments are and they made up 10 percent of GDP, funding would be provided in no time. I know a part of the debate in Washington is going to be whether another stimulus check should be a part of the rules. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 I mean, if they want to send out a stimulus check so they put (inaudible ) name on the check before the election , I mean, people might as well put that in savings because that's where your taxes are going to go up next year. If we think a 10 million dollar deficit on the high end of our projection there's -- it doesn't matter whether we're in Act 47 or not. There is absolutely no way we make up a 10 million dollar shortfall without severe cuts to essential service s. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I echo all of your sentiments . But let's not forget who bailed out these billion dollar companies , who paid for it. We did. So in turn and, you know, I know you mention ed the airlines ; but cruise lines who don't pay taxes in the United States got billions of dollars in bailouts . So it's -- since we paid for that I think we're entitled to -- I shouldn 't say entitled . We're owed some money. So I agree. We have to reach out. We got to put the pressure on, especially at the federal level so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 we can get the same type of, you know, if you want to call it bailout, whatever . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-F legally and lawfully adopted . If there's no further business , I will entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. MCANDREW : I just want to say something I didn't get a chance to say earlier . Kyle made a great point -- or, I'm sorry, Mr. Donahue made a great point earlier saying, you know, of course we can do our part and take our own recyclable s to say Fiegleman 's which is located in the City. Why don't we take the trucks that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 are picking up the recyclables right now or think about actually taking them trucks to Fiegleman 's which is a city-owned business . That's all I have. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. If there is no -- no one else has anything , no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . DR. ROTHCHILD : Motion to adjourn . MR. DONAHUE : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : This meeting 's adjourned . Thank you everyone . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
