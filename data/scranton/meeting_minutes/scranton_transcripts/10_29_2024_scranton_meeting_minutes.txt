VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I just want to start by saying you all missed a really a wonderful , entertaining session this afternoon at the Trolley Museum. Commission Chermak present ed his version of the budget. And you never saw such a humorous screaming match. It was unreal. But if you get home tonight , you know, watch your local TV news because every TV station was there. And so I'm fortunate that adults could act in such a silly manner but, you know, a lot of name calling and screaming and liar, liar pants on fire type comments . Okay, the police collective bargaining agreement , has that been typed up yet? MR. SMURL: It's not completely finished . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey. And DPW is still in negotiations on their contract . They have 63 days left on their contract . How about the 2023 audit, has the Parking Authority produced anything ? MR. SMURL: The Parking Authority 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 audit is complete . They have to approve it and give it to us. And then it will take the city about two weeks to go through it to make sure everything 's correct . MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, good grief. Okay. MR. SMURL: They have to go through it. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I was very pleased to see in the paper that 115 and 117 Penn Avenue, My Mother's Table and the adjoining building were sold to a developer because you know those buildings were very blighted . And it's going to make the 100 block of Penn Avenue look much, much better. It was just nice to see that that happened . The budget meeting s that you described , you're going to put a legal notice in the paper. MR. SMURL: Yes, we are. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, good, so that we could see the list of meetings . I'm curious . Does anyone know who is current ly in charge of Parks and Recreation ? MR. SMURL: There was an assistant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 we hired last year. We approved that position . I don't remember his name. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I hope it's not being double by Scott Gassenmeyer . I think it needs its own -- MR. SMURL: It's not. MS. HODOWANITZ : -- leadership . Scott was given that assistant last year. Okay. Maybe that's something to be clarified during the budget meetings when Parks and Recs is here. Also -- and I know you can't talk about litigation , but there was the article in the paper Scranton taxpayer sues city over rejection of low bid on splash pad project . I found it very interesting that they received six bids. And the bid that was considered the lowest responsible bid was the very highest bid. Now, we cannot talk about the person that's suing and that bid and the city's handling of it and rational e. But this seems to be very strange that they would have to go to the very highest bidder of six bids as the lowest responsible bid. That does -- that does cause people to ask questions what's going on here, okay, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 because at the face value of it, you have to assume that, well, all of those five bidders even though they were lower than the one that was accepted , they're not responsible bidders . And I'm beginning to wonder, you know, who's making these decisions when they choose a bid. So I know that you cannot discuss litigation . I'm not asking you to. But I think people are talking . And this has been a topic on talk radio and people are very, very surprised to see that happen. And I wish you all a happy Halloween . Like I said, it's unfortunate that you missed the high jinx at 3:00 this afternoon . Watch TV tonight . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . This is something I talked about the last few weeks and it's 7th Avenue by Scranton High cars are still parking illegal ly there. I went by Friday and there were cars parked in a bus stop. The bus had to park in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 back of the cars that are parked in the bus stop, partially blocking the lane of traffic . And there's cars in back of the bus again, was no parks signs. I don't know why nothing 's being done. They should have a police officer there every day. They would be able to write tickets and make a fortune because like I said it is a safety hazard because they are halfway in the lane of traffic when they park. Next thing, well, Paige Cognetti and Donald Trump have something in common. They are both anti-Semitic . Paige Cognetti refuses to fly the Israeli flag. And Donald Trump said that Adolph Hitler did some good things. When I heard that, it blew my mind. How anybody could vote for that guy is unbelievable , killed 6 million Jews and Donald Trump said he did some good things. Unbelievable . And that was told by his chief of staff. Next thing, last Wednesday I went to the budget meeting up in Waverly . And the commissioner s spoke first. They gave some convincing reasons why they had to raise the taxes 33 percent . I was there and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 a bunch of other people. I said, you know, I'm not against tax hikes, but 33 percent is unbelievable . There are people like me who are on Social Security , fixed income, we can't afford that. And, of course, a lot of people got up and spoke. I don't know if they're going to do anything about it. I think there is another meeting tonight in Carbondale . I just hope they could somehow work it out where it's not 33 percent . It's going to hurt a lot of people. I just hope we don't get whacked by the city too. That's all I have tonight . I hope everybody has a happy and safe Halloween . I know there's probably going to be a lot of people out. It's going to be like summer out there on Thursday . Well, see you next time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Lee Morgan. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can you reach out to I guess it would be the Police Chief to see if they could take a look into that situation where parents are parking at the bus stop and kind of blocking up the street 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 there? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is, you know, next Tuesday is Election Day. And I'd say do yourself a big favor vote for Donald Trump. And, you know, start realizing that we have to restructure our government and stop listening to the silly things that the news says. And the democrats and Joe Biden and, you know, Mrs. Harris, they have nothing to offer this country . They only flew people in and looted this country . The American Recovery Plan is just really a problem . Now, what I came here today basically to speak about is the amount of money that people are paying for their water bills and their sewer bills. First, I'd like to give people my phone number, 570-558-1648. I got a couple people that are working with me. We have to do something about this situation . We can't count on our Council to help us or the Mayor. And the PUC is appoint ed by the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Governor . They're basically useless . And you just can't live in a city where you can't afford your water and your sewer. And this goes back to Joe Weschler who was Council President and introduced the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority . And then you look at Wayne Evans, Pat Rogan, Tim Perry, and Bill Gaughan -- now, I believe Pat Rogan moved outside the city now. But when you listen to people talk about how they're being extorted by the water company 2, 300 dollar water bills and sewer bills all because over the course of my lifetime coming to these Council meeting s, we put a lot of corrupt people in the Council seats. And instead of worrying about Scranton 's government being run by a business , they were putting political supporters into the sewer authority . And what happened is the residents locally and even nationally -- that's why the country is a mess. People don't vote and they don't think their vote matters and they don't protect their interest . But the looting of the Scranton Sewer Authority was the most atrocious 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 thing that we remember in modern history here in the city. And don't forget that we had Bill Courtright who was beyond corrupt . I mean, the things he did, he should have been prosecuted for a lot more than he was prosecuted for. And, you know, we should start talking about the Parking Authority , not just the sewer authority and a lot of other things he did like ECTV and the detriment . And, you know, I just think that the residents have to realize that, you know, we needed the public access channel to talk about issues like, you know, the water and the sewer rates. But the Council and the Mayor -- and I think that when we go to court we're going to find out that there were a lot more people involved in what happened at ECTV. They're trying to -- they're trying to do some crazy things. But, you know, I hope people call me. We got to get rid of this Council . And we have to get rid of this Mayor because I don't want to hear who died this week, okay. I appreciate the residents and I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 respect that they live here and that they've passed away. And I really have very little interest in who's having a spaghetti dinner. But you know what I want to hear, I want to hear neighborhood leaders come here and ask the Council to do things for their neighborhood , not meet in their neighborhood meetings and see if they could work a deal for themselves and con somebody into giving them a little bit of grant money, okay, because that's been a detriment to the people in the city. We've elected very corrupt , incapable people in Council and the Mayor's office. The last competent mayor we had in my opinion was Jimmy Connors. And then they name a park after Chris Doherty . And when you look at his history , it's almost ludicrous . The guy must have a steel box at home with a ton of money in it. I mean, the things he did to the resident s of this city, you can't fix stupid. So look it, do yourself a big favor on Election Day. Go vote for Trump. Call my number, 570-558-1648. Let's get together , talk about some solutions and move forward with the water and the sewer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 problems and many other issues. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . Well, next time we meet there will be a new leader. I'd like to quickly discuss a commercial I've seen on television a half dozen times or so. Since Obama's attack on America 's years back, we have been on a downward spiral on our values, morality, and especially the sanctuary of life. A good example of the evils Harris has inflicted upon us is this political ad, a father of all things, a father wishes his daughter always has access to abortions , not wishing for a beautiful wedding and a beautiful bride and so forth. This is such a terrible degrading thing for our country for people to reach such a low point in life. To have the ability -- he wants her to have the ability for this deliberate barbaric assault on life, this murderous procedure . It just destroys American values to have a commercial like that in my opinion . I think the Planned Parenthood slaughter houses 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 shouldn't receive another penny of tax money. They shouldn 't be allowed as far as I'm concerned . But I guess it's not up to -- they consider them a business . They should receive no federal funds whatsoever . You know, I hear and see people all upset about puppy mills. But the murder of innocence , nobody seems to consider so disastrous as I do. I just wonder if any of these people ever thought what someone -- some of these stolen lives might have accomplished had they lived -- been allowed to live. But, no, I really -- I appreciate all of the anti-abortionists that have expressed their wishes during the past few months. And very fortunately for these proabortionists , their parents weren't proabortionists . One thing I would like to compliment is how the democrat s have brought Harris out of complete 100 percent obscurity two months ago into leading the country like we see now. But the leadership , the leadership is going the wrong way when young people look 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 so up to entertain ers. The entertainers ' futures are assured . Some day these people are going to have to clothe themselves and house themselves and feed themselves . And unless they're an illegal immigrant , they're going to have to learn to do it themselves . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That is all for the sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to speak? MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Council , Virgil Argenta , I'm here to discuss the Capouse Avenue splash pad lawsuit . It makes me as a city taxpayer very concerned . I understand the city is going to use an outside attorney on this lawsuit against this local contractor . Who is going to pay for the outside attorney ? And will the taxpayer s be responsible to pay the lawsuit ? Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the City of Scranton have their own law department with the attorney s that are paid from the city government with taxpayer money? Are they capable of handling any lawsuits ? Previously when different contractors sued the City of Scranton and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 judge ruled in favor of the contractors , it's my understanding that the city did not have enough insurance coverage available to cover the loss, therefore , the city taxpayers had to dig into their pockets and pay the difference . Is this going to be a regular occurrence of lawsuits ? It makes more sense to have the city and the contractor get together sooner than later to iron out the issues and resolve the matter amicably instead of the city starting a costly legal battle, another unnecessary lawsuit that could have been present because the city didn't want to work this out properly with the general contractor . I hear politicians talking about change orders on most projects . Don't most change orders come from the owner or drawings that are incomplete or underdesigned ? Why is no one held account able for this? Speaking of change orders, the city apparently has an issue with the general contractor that was on the Novembrino Splash Pad with their change orders. Yet, the owner, the city, and the architect both signed off and accepted almost all the change orders for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Novembrino Splash Pad. They were request ed by the architect engineer and owner, the city. Sounds like these change orders were needed to complete this job. Funny thing is, in the splash pad, they had Prime contracts . The contractor that had the plumbing contract doubled his original price during the project with change orders. No one questioned that. The city's grant had no issues with them or giving them additional contracts . The plumbing firm is current ly working on the project with the City of Scranton and are working at the Weston Field project right now. After doing a little research, I found out that the Prime Plumbing contract with the Novembrino Splash Pad sent in one of the change orders which was approve d and signed off by the city who is the owner and the architect for approximately $18,000. But this work was clearly detailed on the plumbing drawing as part of the original contract . Something seems to be one-sided. Are we playing favorite s with who we hire? Who does this contractor know that did the plumbing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 work at the Novembrino Splash Pad that is now at Weston Field? Do we have a bid process or a system that contractors must adhere to or does the city mayor pick and choose who they want to hire. So again, my suggestion as a taxpayer is to try to avoid this lawsuit by having both sides sit down and reach an amicable solution to this and do not drag on as the city can also avoid unnecessary legal fees which will guarantee that the city taxpayers won't have to dig into their pockets again. This needs to stop. It's time to put the petty differences aside and do the right thing for the taxpayers for once. Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tonight I'm going to read from a prepared statement . A week from now the national election will be over. A year from now 53 weeks, reelection for this current administration . There is so many things that are wrong. Let me start this evening by talking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 about poor practices by this administration . Let's start with the lawsuits , 59 were settled in the last 18 months at a cost to the City of Scranton and its taxpayer s 6.4 million dollars . There are two current lawsuit s that are also alarming , one of them which was very recently filed regarding poor bidding practices involving the splash pad and park at Capouse Avenue. Lowest bidder is a city local family contract or who has apparently served our area for more than 60 years. They have extensive experience and have installed Novembrino Splash Pad without any issues. Yet, they were overlooked for no valid reason which cost the city an extra $260,000 and local worker wages to the lowest bidder. Another is the ongoing lawsuit filed by Marty Flynn's mom who was wrongfully terminated one year left before her available pension . I'm sure Ufberg is making bank on this one at a rate of $400 per hour. How about the condemned property that was recently torn down without notification sent to the property owners? How much will that cost?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 The current county commissioners are stuck having to raise taxes because of poor choices made by the prior administration . It makes me wonder how much money in unpaid bills are just sitting there by this expansion team here in the City of Scranton . This administration cannot even budget for a parks' system consisting of only one pool. How about giving the Serrenti Center to the county for a juvenile detention center? That's probably the best possible use. Why does she refuse to allow proper official s to investigate the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority ? Is there a rain tax coming after her reelection ? This very Council has been misguided by this administration to no end. Money was approved and wasted on studies and ended up singling out veterans and a holistic approach to crime. Enough with the studies , consultant s, and the wasteful spending that the city does not have. Money was also spent on marketing to get more qualified individuals to take the Scranton Police exam. One hundred 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 thirty took the exam which ended up with a few hires. The Police Chief feels his department should be held to a higher standard so the scores are even higher than the national average . One that was recently sworn in hit a tree at 4 a.m. He was Ubered home by a shift supervisor without any charges . There was also no sobriety test given. No wonder morale with our police department is at an all time low. One thing is for sure, we have one of the best police departments in the country . I have to mention crosswalk s and visible signs for safety with Halloween this coming Thursday . I did notice our hard-working crews out on Saturday starting the task of painting these sidewalks . Mr. Smurl, I also noticed that your intersection was done. Are people slowing down? Are they paying attention ? Is traffic slowing down in your area? You're only maybe like .5 percent of the city that has the availability for the crosswalks . What's the speed limit at Nay Aug? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 There's no signs. What's the speed limit in the school zone? None of them are posted at 15 miles an hour. These need to be addressed . There also needs to be a traffic study for 12th Avenue and Luzerne Street. A stop sign is needed. She would notice these things if she paid attention . We need to put our own eyes on things. We need an engineer or paving inspections . Using a third party from another county with no oversight is not the answer. It becomes a waste of money and additional expenses . This administration is not the answer. I hope that everybody pays attention to what this expansion team is doing. There are so many good people in Scranton that truly deserve better. We will continue to push her buttons like a 12 year old playing fort night. It becomes -- it seems like as if the only way to get things done on time is if we push to do it ourselves. We deserve better. We are Scranton strong. We, the people, will make Scranton great again. This is not a prediction . This is a spoiler . Fifty-three 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 weeks from now with 0 percent reporting, Paige Cognetti , you're fired. Change is coming. Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries, Scranton resident . And I want to thank whoever was responsible for putting the rules of order for our Council meeting s back and being published . So thank you. The reason that I wanted them so much and I'm not prepare d to speak on it because I wasn't going to speak tonight . But as I looked on these, I just sit in confusion as to what should be discussed at this podium. If we look at the information on the back of this bulletin , it says any person authorize d to address Council shall be limited to speaking exclusively on matters of concern to the Council that are contained in 3rd, 5th, 6th or 7th order -- we violate that -- of the meeting agenda and may speak on nonagenda items of concern to the Council . That's what I circled , concern to the Council . What is a concern to the Council ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 I don't understand what that is. Is a concern of the Council that we could sit up here and talk politics from this podium, that we all don't get up here and give our other side of what's going on? Who then decides what's the concern of Council ? Then if you go down to the next one it says name calling , profanity , racial or ethnic slurs or any other behavior that is inconsistent with the purpose and intent of conducting official business shall not be permitted . So as some stand here at the podium and use words that I think are derogatory and they scandal and, oh, I can't even begin to remember the words that they use. I was going to write them down but my pen didn't work. But week after week after week, this podium is used that I don't think should be used for national politics . Local politics is one thing, but national politics should we all get up here -- we could have 15 people come up here and talk nothing but politics . That's not right. So I just wondered at what point does Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 consider something your concern . That's all I have tonight . MR. SMURL: Norma, there's some information there for you. Last week -- MS. JEFFRIES : I'm sorry? MR. SMURL: That was information that you requested last week for the $2.50 fee for Weston Field and also the information on the Scranton Lackawanna unsheltered . MS. JEFFRIES : Thank you very much because I was going to speak on that. But I was hoping that it would be -- I do have a meeting at the NAACP tonight at 7:30. So this is one of the items that we'll be discussing . So thank you for this. I appreciate it. MR. SMURL: Sure. Thank you. MR. COYNE: Good evening , Council and tonight 's viewing audience , Tom Coyne, Minooka . A few things tonight I could not say because I was distract ed by my speech last week. First, the easy question . As winter approaches , why are not we not able to track our trash pickups, the street sweeper and plows? We could track the Lackawanna County 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 buses in real time but we can't track city services . I understand License and Inspection because you need them to appear unannounced . But the only time that I have ever seen the street sweeper is as a float in the St. Patrick 's Day parade. Maybe if the power washer could have been tracked , it would have not gone walk about for two years for personal use. If Rubicon has city routes set up, then tracking a street sweeper would allow residents to move their vehicles as they would have warning before it got to the location . People could even set up alerts like an Amazon package delivery . Heaven forbid we have forward thinking ideas. Onto the HUP test, the review of nonprofits , it was reported that there are issues. What was said was, that the county is lacking supporting documentation required . It is missing at the Assessor 's office. If the nonprofit has failed to provide compliance paperwork , they should be taxed until the proper paperwork is filled and they are in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 compliance like any other citizen . We are billed until it's correct ed and resolved . Why do non-profits get special dispensation ? Second, as the review has hit a roadblock on some, out of the ones currently reviewed, has it as of yet identified any properties for adding back to the tax rolls and have they been? What percentage complete have been reviewed and in compliance and what percentage have been identified as noncompliant and returned to the tax rolls? As for asking for help from the pilots, the non-profits have certainly told us any pilots to go fly themselves . Onto 7-A, street cameras , the entire submission lacks detail. How many, what does $40,830 get us? I would also be careful as it lacks any information of how or why this location was chosen. The only qualification stated was a qualified census track. What does that say? Devoid from any police call correlation s, it is the use of federal funding based on cameras to watch the poor and race-based sections . Now, if it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 part of a larger comprehensive city identification and rollout and it was partially funded by the Recovery Act, I would see no issue or even based on crime call volume to a specific location in excess of others. But as it stands, we are targeting economically impact areas without identifying a crime study, specific call volume comparisons over the entire city. It can be drawn that the goal is to target populations like Skyview and Valley View Terrace . Without supporting documents , this may be a targeting liability for the City of Scranton . We have 7-C. Now this is under court suit. Would it not be prudent to table it until the suit sets course? I understand we have to have this voted by December for the Recovery Act funds. But that doesn't stop us from tabling it for a month to see where this actually plays out. Remember the City Hall health manager, $140,000 a year from Clarks Summit whose contribution was to print or have the IT Department put up links from other agencies , attend the Mayor's meeting s as a health 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 showpiece while ignoring the homeless , still a thing. For $210,000 did we ever have one recommendation from our and not a handout of other people's work? I understand the foundation s and the hospitals are separate entities , but has that bill been paid for the time she was here? Now I ask for fiscal responsibility . Unlike the do-nothing recycling dump fee costing to date over $19,000. Have we adjusted our budget for the lack of funding from the hospital which is now going non-profit? Has anyone looked at that? Are we going to keep last year's numbers as usual? And last as a public reminder , the last meeting for 33 percent county tax increase is tomorrow at noon at the Globe Store, the 5th floor. And this weekend , set those clocks backwards. Thank you and good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I'm going to differentiate on that prior speech about politics . We're part of the United States of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 America and anything that happens in Washington affects us. Now, we have the 2025 project . First of all, suspend the Constitution , the preface -- the author of the preface is JD Vance, of course, vice president candidate . Approximate contributors , 29 Trump aides, coauthors and former Trump aides. Cuts are in Social Security , medicare , 61 votes prior to destroy the Affordable Care Act and eliminate it, possible ban on abortion , no exceptions nationally , rape, insist or life of the mother is not considered and birth control also will be cancelled . And by the way, if a woman comes -- has a difficult pregnancy or has a miscarriage and winds up ten days in the hospital , what happens with the bill? Who is responsible for that bill? That's something that popped in my mind. I think about things a long time before I open my mouth. Threats against legitimate political ops, threaten ing the Insurrection Act which was a 1700 -- late 1700 and the only time it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 used was against the Japanese since then during World War II, election interference and -- I mean, Russia. You know, Russia if you're listening, find those e-mails. Well, that $750 claim that is circulating around for those people down in North Carolina is Russian origin and Tehran and a few other jerks in this world. Recently disclosed , seven calls to Putin. Elon Musk also seven calls to Putin. Now, they have top security clearance . What in the hell are they talking to Putin for? And then there was a loan from Trump organization for 10 million dollars to his campaign in the last -- the last campaign . And Egypt paid 10 million dollars back to the Trump organization . New York Times, 30,000 in one term or partial truths, whatever you want to call it. January 6th, organized a riot. We all seen that on TV. I don't have to describe it or waste any more time. And eliminate the Civil Service Department of Education parochial . I went to a parochial school. My mother was Methodist and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 previously divorced . And I did not have a good time in it. To this day, I won't attend any religious organization , period. And it just goes on and on and on. I mean, it's -- 2025 project is 900 pages, just imagine if Social Security or Medicare didn't exist and you had a relative -- wind up with a relative dying on your couch, your sofa in your living room because they can't get the kind of treatment that they need or they can't be in a hospital or a nursing home. It's just unGodly. It's really -- and by the way, back before these institutions existed , you had Orphan's Court. You could have somebody that burned your last house down and they could call you into court and say, hey, this guy is indigent . You have to take them in. Thank you, and have a good night. THE COURT: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: A few comments , you know, we sit here and we listen to criticism and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 that's fair enough. You know, the city is far from perfect . There is issues in the city as there are in many other cities throughout the country . But it's difficult to sit here and have somebody say you did nothing when the PUC and Pennsylvania American Water Company , you know, presented an increase . And I know for a fact that all five of the people sitting up here along are our State Reps, our State Senator , our Mayor, every one of us fought that increase and got it scaled back to 50 percent . The unfortunate part is it's just so difficult to beat the Public Utility Commission . But I can't sit here and let somebody say that we did nothing . We did something . And it resulted in a reduction in the requested increase, not as much of a reduction as we would have wanted. We wanted zero. But we got the thing cut in half. So for somebody to say that we did nothing , that's an untruth. The other piece is somebody said about the neighborhood s, we do nothing for the neighborhoods . Well, take a drive up to Oakmont 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Park and take a look at that park. Take a drive up to Robinson Park and see that park, which is almost done. Nay Aug Park is going to be done with the new pool, splash pads, pickleball courts. Capouse Park -- excuse me, I'm speaking right now. Thank you. Novembrino Park, Weston Field is going to be done. And we're going to vote on that tonight with skate park and a brand new swimming pool. Pretzel park has been improved , almost every park in the city. We've paved streets in the neighborhood s to make our neighborhoods better. All I could say is people want to come, they want to criticize , that's fine. We're open game. But I'll tell you what, if you really want to do something , go out and get 100 signature s, get your name on the ballot and you run and sit up here and you can do it, can't wait. Absolutely . So I look forward to that. I encourage -- I respect anybody that's willing to put their name on a ballot and run for this office and then come up and we'll see what you could do. Thank you. Have a good evening . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. I'm going to start off while it's fresh on my mind the HUP test. On October 15th we asked for an update on the HUP test. And I'm going to have to ask again tonight for an update on the HUP test. And the response that we got back it was stated that the city had a meeting with Lackawanna County and the Scranton School District on September 4th to determine how the Assessor 's office is going to collect the information that's needed. In that response it also states that the Assessor 's office is drafting a letter to be included with the mailings to nonprofit property owners as part of the reassessment . Can we get clarification on what are our next steps forward with the HUP test? Tell us how we're going to move forward with that and possibly get a copy of the letter that's being sent out. Is the way that we're going to move 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 forward just a letter that is coming with the reassessment or are we going to do a little bit more than that? That's the first one. The second one, I had some calls from some residents around All Saints Academy about refuse pickup. And it was occurring around the same time as the drop-off of student s in the morning . It was causing some congestion . And I kind of parlayed that into a question about Rubicon as well. But the original question I had, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could, is have we changed the schedule for our refuse pickups ? It seems like it wasn't something that was an issue for the last several years but it's an issue as of the last three or four weeks. So if we could just see if there's been a schedule change. And it could be a change of just about 10, 15 minutes that's causing the backup on that. MR. VOLDENBERG : They were asked to change the schedule . I'll ask if they did. MR. SCHUSTER : Oh, okay, thank you very much. With that being said, we did get an update on Rubicon . What was stated is Rubicon 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 is in the final round of optimization testing which focuses on turn by turn notification s. Routes have been optimize d tested via route driving and are in the final testing phases. We anticipate that optimize d routes will be completed prior to December 31st and that date is specific for a reason. That is the end of the Rubicon contract I'm sure. And they are going to provide updates when it goes live. So I'd love to know when this system is going live. Another question if we could just expand on that is, are we going to be asking for an extension or are we going to be looking to renew the contract with Rubicon ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Next, Dr. Rothchild had asked about an update on the unsheltered task force. We discussed it somewhat tonight in caucus. And questions that arose from me out of caucus tonight were are there going to be minutes to the unshelter ed task forces meetings if we could find out if there's going to be minutes and any updates 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 that have come out of our meeting -- the most recent meeting. I think it was October 3rd. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I attended the Keyser Valley stormwater meeting last Thursday . And a couple question s arose from me out of that meeting . I do have a copy of the study here. So thank you, Mr. Voldenberg , for that and some of the other materials that went with that. What was present ed at Thursday 's meeting was that there was an initial study on the pump house. So my first question when it comes to Keyser Valley is, was there an initial study on just the pump house alone? It seemed like in the presentation of that meeting that's how it started and then it expanded . Keyser Valley stormwater and flood mitigation study, is that the second study that occurred and there's an original study on the pump house or was the pump house study rolled into this study here? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll clarify . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. When it comes to the timeline of events, the bids for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Keyser Valley and -- were accepted in 2020. We've -- the contract was ratified by 2021. The study was compete d by September of 2021. And right now we're looking to start work in summer or spring of 2025. So it's a large timeline with years in between the completion of the study in September of 2021 to the beginning of the work in September of 2025. So could we ask specifically when will the work in Keyser Valley begin if we could get a timeline on when that work will begin? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Another question coming out of that meeting was buyout program . Some residents at that meeting had question s specifically about the buyout program . At the meeting they were told that those question s would not be answered that that is not a meeting to discuss that. But can we find out where we're at with our buyout program and have any of the resident s been bought out of their properties in Keyser Valley or North Scranton ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 questions also. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And then next, has the city tracked the residents who are not in their home after the 9/9 flooding and have we tracked all the damage on the properties ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : And then with that, where is the city with aid to damaged properties , is the city still process ing these claims, what has been awarded so far, what is pending and then what has been denied? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much, Mr. Voldenberg . Thanks for bearing with me there. That's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. First off, since I wasn't present at the beginning I did just want to give a shoutout to the DPW thanking them for the trunk or treat that took place a few days ago that they do every year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 My daughter really enjoyed it. And it's always a great time. And it's nice to see our DPW crew and their families handing out candy, so thank you for that. I wanted to -- I don't believe anyone had mentioned some of the details with the election next week. So I just wanted to remind voters that next Tuesday , November 5th, polls are open from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. And you could just go to PA.gov and you find all your voting information if you want to make sure that your polling location is still the same place or if you have any concerns . If you have a mail-in ballot, please get it in. You do have until 8 p.m. Election Day to be able to submit it, but the earlier the better. And if you have issues the day of the election with voting and you need to contact someone , the correct number to be able to do that is 877-868-3772. And I have received an e-mail update from a resident who noticed that at the corner of Colfax and Vine that there were markings at the curb site there that we've been asking for a curb cut. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 So that gives me some hope that that's going to be completed or that it's at least in the process . And I know I spoke with Mr. Voldenberg too who said that he knows it's been forwarded to the appropriate parties to make sure that they get out there and apparently they've started it. MR. VOLDENBERG : We'll follow through , Doctor. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Excellent . And I just wanted to touch on the unsheltered task. So previously when I had asked about it, I had already attended a meeting , expressed an interest in being on the task force. So it's my understanding I was able to be a part of that. We've -- I mean, at least over the course of the year had many discussions about the homeless and unsheltered population within Scranton . And it's particularly important to me that we do everything as a city to be able to help them and to house the homeless and to identify the issues that we have in the city, you know, the primary one being just like a lack of shelters and enough places for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 homeless to be able to go. So that was how I think I came to be involved with it. And we were notified because I had asked of what the date of the following meeting was. I know we had asked for meeting minutes before and we were told that the -- that we would just be provided with updates but that there were no minutes being taken. And I thought that I would get a formal invite to the last meeting because all we had gotten was a date. I didn't get a time or a location or anything like that. And then before I knew it, the day had passed and I wasn't sure if the meeting had even occurred . So that is why I had asked about it the other week. And all I was given was that Council was informed of the October 3rd meeting of the unsheltered task force and the city will provide necessary updates . So I still don't know what that means. And, you know, I only ask because I think this is so important that we know what's going on with it. The public has had a great interest in this. And the cold weather is going to be approach ing. I know we've had an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 uncharacteristically warm October . But before we know it, it will be cold and we'll, you know, we'll want to be able to help as many who are unsheltered as we can, especially during the colder months. And so that's, you know, I guess my question is, if any Council members are still invited to the task force and if we could get provided with further information on future meeting s and if there are updates that are going to be coming -- forthcoming to us. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out and I'll request that they provide the update that we've asked for before. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. I greatly appreciate that. And a resident had contacted me who was contacting American Water with questions about the rate hikes and incidentally found out about a program that they didn't believe that most residents were familiar with. And they wanted to make sure that maybe Council could announce it so that people would be aware. And so it's with regard to irrigation meters. So this is something that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 American Water could install at no cost to the resident . So it's going to be most useful for those with larger properties , maybe like a sprinkler system or a pool. And instead of being charged by water consumption in total, this meter would monitor the water that goes specifically through the sewer line. So that's perhaps an option that people might want to look into and a potential way of saving money. And I think that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a couple. Dr. Rothchild , I think the same resident reached out to me about that also. And I was going to bring it up. That's fine, but you know what, it's amazing that we don't know about this separate line that could be put in called an irrigation line that will allow you -- because what happens , we all know that whatever water we turn on the faucet whether it goes down the drain or not into the sewer, we're charged for.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 But obviously there's a program that you can reach out to the water company and say, hey, I want a separate line put in. They'll install that for free. I guess the connection to your house you are responsible for. But you are no longer going to pay if you fill your pool or, you know, water your flowers . And it's ironic, I was away this weekend at Cape May and stayed with some friends . And the friends told me the same thing because they have a beautiful property that has sprinkler system. They said, oh, no, we have that separate setup which I thought , wow, I mean, and she goes everybody down here is aware of it. I said, guess what, nobody in Scranton is aware of this. So let's get some more information from them, maybe put it on our website in some fashion to provide some education and awareness to the residents that, you know, they're feeling these water increases that are horrible that we did fight for, Mr. King. And I appreciate you bringing that up. We all spoke. So let's see if we could help some people out with that information .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 Secondly , so I'm a teacher . My first quarter grades are due next week. Back in August a few crossing guards came to me and said, you know, with a very small ask, hey, can we have an increase . I'm like, sure, you deserve it. You're our line of defense every day with our kids getting on buses, getting across the street, braving the weather . The elements are coming soon. I know it's nice out but don't be misled. It's going to be cold soon and there will be sleet flying and snow. And not do they put up with the elements , but they put up with parents. And they put up with cars that are flying around them. So their ask was small. I know there's been some conversation with our administration and I think the school district . So like I said, the second quarter starts. I mean the school year, you know, it's a quick one. It always is. Solicit or Gilbride , I know that you were reaching out. Can you provide us with an update from them when you get a chance or see where we're at with the district with regards -- because I know it has to be mutually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 agreed upon increase . But, you know, I'd like to know where we're at if you would find out. ATTY. GILBRIDE : I'll reach out on that, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I just want to let you know out there we're still going to take care of you and thank you for all of your hard work. Okay, so this has been brought to my attention a couple times. I brought it up a couple of times, right, and I actually took a look at it today. I did months ago but it's the bridge that every truck gets stuck under on Luzerne Street or most trucks. It was brought to my attention a few weeks ago that, you know, it's a disaster . It's filthy under there. There was sleeping bags. And I guess all they did between -- I don't know if it was the city alone or, you know, I know we have a problem with who is responsible if the railroad is or it isn't. But it's still a mess. It's still a disaster . If we could reach out to the department s that will take care of that and finally take responsibility or find out who is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 actually responsible and maintain that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And then right next to it is this gas station that we've had issues with too for the past couple years. Can we get an update on that with regards to because I know it was leaking gas. I know someone was trying to purchase it and there was a stop to that. Do we know if all of that has been rectified ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find that out. MR. MCANDREW : The gas leak and the tanks or whatever , okay. Thank you. And another thing that keeps being brought to my attention -- and I know in the new zoning ordinance -- well, it's not new anymore . It's been around a little while now that Airbnb or short term rentals, whatever , you know, that we're going to refer to, they're popping up, guys. And people are coming to me. This isn't the first. This isn't the second. This is probably the fourth where a resident will come to me and say, hey, Mark, I think there's an Airbnb going on. What's the deal? What's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 the process ? You know, and it's been a little vague as to who enforces this process because or polices it because we were told -- and it's in the ordinance that, okay, you want to open an Airbnb, you got to go before the zoning. I don't think it's happening. I don't know if code enforcement is responsible , you know, to check on that. And, you know, guess what, you know your own neighborhood . If you start seeing three or four cars every week and different plates parking within a block from you and it's a house that is pretty much vacant during the week, you know there's an Airbnb going on. So this one brought to my attention if they could look at it. It's 912 Monroe if they could check it out. But could we please get from the administration protocol , maybe just a form, a bullet form how it's enforced, how it's policed , what are the steps because I know certain parts of the city are approve d for short term rentals or Airbnbs . But maybe we could get some clarity for the residents as to where they are and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 where they're allowed and how it's being enforced or tracked or whatever because , you know, they're bringing in revenue . It's taxable . Are they paying taxes? I know that might be a spec out of our purview but I think we need to get of it because I believe there's more popping up because I hear about it all the time. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, thank you. So, okay, this is -- this is back -- I know I got my first response on it says from the October 8th meeting . But we've been talking about this a while. This happened -- you know, we had to quick rush and get MOUs done about, you know, the residency for, you know, the MOA we had to vote, immediately on because , you know, we have to do it quick with regards to DPW and the fire bargaining units. And so for the -- since October 8th I get the same response every week. So the -- may the city administration further to Councilman Schuster 's inquiry -- he brought it up first. I piggybacked on it -- last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 please update Council discussion s are being held regarding MOA with DPW and fire bargaining units. Right, this is since October 8th every week. We're still in discussion with DPW and fire bargaining units. All right. Can we ask what are they discussing ? I mean, it's pretty much -- there's MOU, right, signed by both parties . Let's go. And then also again, Mr. McAndrew asked again further to Mr. Schuster 's inquiry last week -- and this is not last week. This is weeks. We're talking weeks now if the administration may yet advise a question . Are SPD, SFD, DPW and clerical employees allowed to move out of the city at this time or is this still a factor being negotiated , which we were told it won't be negotiated because there was an MOA, right, with the city labor attorneys . What do we get again a month, it's going to a month. Response forthcoming . So I'm hearing chatter from some of these hard workers in the city that are afraid to move out because they're, you know, indirectly being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 warned you better not. So I want some clarity on that, please if we could get it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll secure that information . MR. MCANDREW : People I talk to out there say, no, we're good. We had to sign. We're good. And the holdup is the labor attorney . So, you know, when that's a holdup, you know what's going on. There's more money being made for them. So I think, you know, this has to be settled once and for all. And I don't want to keep hearing a response is forthcoming . How long? It's already a month. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I just have a few blight issues that were handled from code enforcement issues. The 300 block of Crown Avenue that commercial tractor that was parked there for months has been removed and also the illegal garage on the corner of Prospect Avenue and Maple Street, that was shut down. And the 1000 block of Beech Street -- I guess there's concrete barriers or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 something up there. The city advised me today that they will be taking care of those immediately . They are trying to get them in, but we are working on that. And all of the cars and all of the blight issues and the cleanups that have been going on the past two months and there was over 100 cars towed, I want to thank the Scranton Police Department for working with code enforcement in not only citing these cars but now removing them from the streets , removing them from the houses, from their yards, all of these cars that were not inspect ed or not registered . They've taken out tractor -trailers . They've taken out motor homes among other things and so I thank the Scranton Police Department . Also, the DPW, they came in on a few of them where they moved some of the stuff and found tons of garbage throughout these areas. And no one being around, no one, you know, trying to find the owners. So DPW did come in and clean up multiple sites for us and I thank them for doing that. And that is all I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 have, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. SCHUSTER : Can I say one thing on short term rentals ? Actually I have two things. I'm sorry about this. When we ask PA Water about the irrigation systems , can we find out what the average cost is to the resident to put that into their home? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And then secondly , when it comes to short term rentals, I know Mr. McAndrew had a couple addresses . I know that I got a list of some addresses . When looking at the zoning, it's considered short term rental. The resident of the property must occupy the property for at least six months. When it comes to the areas that I've received addresses and there usually R8 sections of the city or R10 sections of the city and it is through special exemption . So can we ask the administration how they're tracking these properties ? Are they going through the zoning board? Are they getting the special exemptions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 they need and are they going through rental inspections as well as Mr. King brought up to me the Payroll Prep Tax if they would be eligible to be -- for the Payroll Prep Tax. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. MCANDREW : On the question , this is fantastic . I mean, we have both a protective services class up there. We have an automotive class and a collision repair class. So receiving -- and this isn't unusual . I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 in the past I'm there 18 years. When I first started there was a fire truck that was donated that the students used to practice on running drills. And also the auto and collision would work on the vehicle itself. So this to me would be a great integrated project for the three classes that probably would be involved with it. So I'm happy to see that. And I thank and appreciate the donation . MR.

FOR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 133, 2024 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT (ARPA) DIRECTOR TO OBLIGATE STATE AND LOCAL FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS (SLFRF) TO DELIVER COMPREHENSIVE ENGINEERING , DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION SERVICES FOR THE WESTON FIELD SKATEPARK . MR. SMURL: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works? MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final vote on Item 7-B. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , so there are -- it's my understanding that there is some more planning meeting s coming up in the future, at least one other meeting . MR. SMURL: Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. This here is to carry out the skate park. I did get some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 concerns from some of the residents in the area. They felt that the plan had changed several times. But the last iteration of the plan, it seemed that some of the noisier aspects or amenities of the park were now being moved into more -- closer to the residential areas of the park. I did request from Mr. Voldenberg a schematic or a plan if you could get it from the administration of what the current schematic is of that neighborhood . But I don't want to -- I wouldn't like to move forward with this if this is setting it in stone that this project is going to start. Do we know that there is further planning involved before we -- MR. SMURL: There is a further meeting . The first meeting was they had three suggested layouts . That was invited were the neighbors and the people that do the skate park's design and naturally people that use the skate park. So they took three of those designs and they picked out their pieces that they liked. And there are going to -- I guess there was an A, B, and C. So A and C had options 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 that everybody agreed on. So they're going to consolidate A and C and have another meeting and then bring it back to the neighborhood again. So it's still not exactly where it should be. But like I said in caucus, I'm willing to go down and anyone else who wants to go down and go over this. MR. SCHUSTER : Do we know what the estimated date for groundbreaking is? This isn't going to be something that's going to -- MR. SMURL: I don't believe this year. I don't believe this year because they -- this is only design. This isn't contract . MR. KING: I think it's a spring project . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, that's what I would imagine . MR. SMURL: This is probably months and months away. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I just wanted their concerns to be heard. Like I said, some of the layouts that they had stated early iterations seem to be -- they seem to agree 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 upon the layout. But now it seemed that the skate park was moved more into the residential rather than the commercial up on Providence Road so the noisier aspects of the park were going to be near homes. And the areas like the playground which is now very visible on the corner with young children is now going to be moved to the back of the park where the children would have less visibility . I think there's some valid concern s. And I would like to make sure that they get them -- those neighbors get those concerns added to the data collection here. So if we could just find out when that next meeting is and we can announce that to the public so they could make their concerns . MR. SMURL: I would go and if you're interested . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'm definitely -- I would have been interested in the last one I just couldn't make it. MR. SMURL: Okay. Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 MR. KING: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR.
