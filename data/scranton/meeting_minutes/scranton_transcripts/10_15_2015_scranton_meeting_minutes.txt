MR.ROGAN:Gerard Hetman. MR.HETMAN:Goodevening ,Council , Gerard Hetman fromLackawanna County's Community Relations Department .Tobegin thisevening ,inaccordance withthe Lackawanna County'sHomeRulesCharter early thisafternoon Lackawanna County Commissioners presented theirtentative 2016 general fundbudget forpublic review,and ifyoufollow alongwiththehandouts thatI haveprovided ,ourtopsheetcontains our annual quickreference budget graphic that goesoversomeofthekeypoints inthe2016 budget,typically thatbigitemontopis theonemostfolkscomment onthatbeing willbenocounty taxincrease forthe county property millage rateforthe2016 budget asprojected . Oursecond sheetisourannual budget message whichbreaks downsomeofthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 budget figures inalittle bitmoredetail inaneasytoreadformat,soifyoufollow through withmeI'llskiparound alittle bitbutIwillgoinorder,justalittle bitabbreviated fromwhatyouseethere. Important features inthebudget areas follows : First,the2016Lackawanna County general fundbudget includes notax increase .Thecounty taxratewillstaythe sameasitisnowat57.42mills. Secondly ,thecounty isrenewing it'scommitment toeconomic development in the2016budget.Beginning in2013,the county includes programs thatincluded the nationally recognized SBALoanFeeWaiver Program ,theCommunity Re-invest Grant Program ,andthePermit FeeWaiver Program . The2016budget renews funding forthese programs . Third,the2016budget provides resources fortheannual surveillance fee imposed byabondinsurer asacondition of pastborrowing .Thisfeewillbeassessed untilweareabletorestore theCounty's1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 investment graderating.Eliminating the surveillance feecontinues tobeonthis administration 'stoppriorities .Weare currently engaging rating agencies withthe hopeofrestoring ourinvestment grade rating,andifsuccessful ,wewilleliminate theannual surveillance fee.Something we hopetodooverthenextfewmonths toa year.Itisanongoing process withmany variables .Wehopetoseeprogress onthat verysoon. Also,bycompleting itsfourth consecutive financial auditinatimely fashion underthetermsofitsbond indentures ,theCounty generated amodest operating surplus during 2012,and significant surpluses in2013and2014, whichresulted inanaccumulated fund balance totaling $11.1million asof December 31,2014.TheCounty anticipates another moderate surplus during 2015witha projected fundbalance of$11,21,295asof December 31,2015,despite beinghitwith manyunbudgeted expenses during the2015 fiscal year.Thisisviewed positively in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 theeyesoftherating agencies .However , thesurplus for2016andit'sexactestimate isnotguaranteed because ofunexpected expenses thatcouldariseatanytime. Asanother indicator offinancial stability ,theCounty'spension fundwas funded atmorethan80percent asofthe mostrecent valuation date. ToturnoverontotheCounty debt portion oftheaddress ,theCounty continued tofollow itspolicy ofrefinancing debt wherever possible atlowerinterest ratesto produce savings tothecounty without extending thetermofthedebt. Andalsojusttotouchonhuman services area,apretty muchafocuswith theongoing statebudget stalemate .Human services continue tobeahallmark ofthe services offered bycounty government .In spiteoftheState'sbudgecrises,the county hascontinued toprovide ahigh- levelofcommunity service programs atno additional costtothetaxpayers .In addition tothehumanservice programs atno additional costtothetaxpayers .In1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 addition tothehumanservice programs , emergency response ,theCourtsystem, corrections ,andothervitalfunctions performed bythecounty government provides themajority oftheCounty's2016 expenditures .TheCourts andcorrections alonecomprise approximately 40percent of theCounty'stotalanticipated 2016 expenditures . Lastly,justsomehardnumbers .The 2016general fundbudget totals $110, 263,499,whichincludes afundbalance of $11,211,2915.Combine thatwithour capital budget,ourdebtservice fundand ourspecial purpose fundsbudget thetotal ofallCounty funds'budgets for2016is projected tobe$180,735,840. Ishould notethatthebudget is veryvoluminous ,itisover100pageslong anditcanbereadontheCounty website at www.lackawannacounty .orginPDFformat.

MR.ROGAN:Thankyou.Justtwo briefcomments tonight .OnethatIdid mention whenMr.Hetman wasspeaking , regarding thecounty budget wearecertainly allhappythatthereisnotaxincrease this year,butthereisadireneedfor reassessment inLackawanna County.For instance ,justtaking alookatsomeofthe assessments andcomparing themtoproperties within thecityIknowofatwo-unit property inSouthScranton withatotaltax billoflessthan$1,000.Justafewblocks overisasimilar two-unitwithataxbill1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 ofover$3,000.Now,obviously thereis something wrongwiththispicture .I encourage everybody togoontheCounty's website andtakealookatyourtax assessment andyourtaxbillandcompare it toyourneighbor 'sbecause thetaxsystem in Lackawanna County currently isveryunfair. Thereisnostandard calculation forland. Therearemanylotsinthecitythatare beingtaxedatahigher ratethanotherlots thatarelarger insizewhichcertainly makesnosensewhenyouaretalking juston thelandtax. Ontheimprovements ,thereisa little moreroomtonegotiate downthere because thereisonehousemighthavemaybe muchfurther improved thananother house, thenumber offireplace sinthehome, different itemsareusedinthatcalculation whenitwasdone40yearsago,butthereis adireneedforareassessment within Lackawanna County tohaveafairtaxsystem.

AndtheotheritemMr.Evanstouched onjustbriefly isCrunchFitness whohas announced theywillopening a30,000square footfacility within themallandthe archwayinthebridge overLackawanna Avenue,andIbelieve Ihavebeentoldthe samethingthatCouncilmen Evanswasthatit willbeanopenplanwhereas ifyouare driving downyouwillseeanactive gym rightontopofthemallinthatareaand thoseinthegymcanlookdownandseethe city,soit'ssomething thatweare definitely looking into,welooking forward toseeingitopening .

Obviously ,wehavetoletthestatepolice dotheirjob,hopefully therewillbean answer astowhentheyaredone investigating orareport maybereleased nowaswasthecasewiththetaxoffice. Whether something criminal ornotcriminal happened that'scertainly notthejobof citycouncil toinvestigate ,that'sthejob oflawenforcement ,buthowandwhymillions oftaxpayerdollars werewrongly givenout certainly isafunction ofcitycouncil and that'ssomething I'mhoping thatwecantake upintheverynearfuture,andthatisall fortonight .
