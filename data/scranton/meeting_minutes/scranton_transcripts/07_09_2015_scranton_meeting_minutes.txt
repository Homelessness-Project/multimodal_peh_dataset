Lastweekwetalked aboutthe possibility ofliening citizens whohavenot paidtheirgarbage tax.Wehaveresearched itthisweekandNRSdoeshavetheability tofileliensagainst delinquent taxgarbage bills.Sowewillbeworking withthemand alsowiththeadministration andalso Treasurer WayneBecktoseewhatprocess we havetogothrough rightnowtobe determined ,someofthemwillbewhichbills arecollectable ,howfarbackitwouldgo,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 butwehavetogetstarted onthisbecause I don'tIthinkit'sveryfairthateveryone paystheirgarbage billandsomepeople don'tandthereisnorepercussion whenthey don'tpay,soI'mveryanxious togetthis moving forward .

Sothislegislation wasnottargeted toMr.Bolus.Ifeelbadthathefeelsthat way.Hehashadhisproblems withthecity intermsofsometrailers thathehasonhis property ,butthisislegislation thatcame fromtheadministration through theLIPS Department andIcantellyouthatIwasnot involved inthepreparation ofthisasa target forMr.Bolus,but,likeIsaid,sa hestated,itisarequirement thatweget thisthings undercontrol .That'sallI haveatthistime.Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Rogan? MR.ROGAN:Yes,twovery,very briefpoints,Iwilldomostofmycomments andquestioning during thepublichearing .

Secondly ,regarding theCourtaward, obviously nobody --thereisnobody inthe citygovernment thatwantstotakeonmore debt,butwearecurrently paying 6percent interest tohaveadebtcontinue togrowbut notbepaidoff.Byissuing thebonds, hopefully atafavorable rate,yes,wewill stillbepaying interest butthedebtwill bepaidoffitandwon'tcontinue togrowas itcurrently is.Asoneofthespeakers mentioned ,wearepaying nearly $100,000in interest permonthcurrently andthedebtis onlygrowing ,it'snotevenbeingpaidoff totheunions,sothatisall.Thankyou.

MR.COURTRIGHT :Thankyou, President McGoff.Henryhasprepared an overview ofwherewehavebeenandwherewe aregoingsowethankyouforhaving ushere1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 andifyoudon'tmindwe'llstartitoff withabriefoverview ofwhereweareat. MR.MCGOFF:Absolutely .Mr. Amoroso ? MR.AMOROSO :Thankyou.Thankyou, members ofcouncil ,forhaving usback. We'llstartwithreminding everyone thatour planhadessentially 12components toit. Those12components had,included among others things,certain taxes,certain assumptions ontheLST.Therewasachange inthelawfromthetimethatwemoved forward withthe205taxandwiththeLST, andI'lltalkalittle bitaboutthatas well,andmuchofourplan,ifnotthe entirety ofourplan,wasincorporated into thePELrecovery planthatyouhaveall participated in,sowehavebeenworking on theplan,moving italongitemthrough item, all12ofouritems,eachofthemmoving forward consistent withwhatour expectations are. Soifyouweretoasknowwherewe thinktheplanstandIthinkthatweareon trackandIthinkinsomeareasweare1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 exceeded expectations ,andIthinkinsome areaswearejustalittle bitbehind on timing,butwehavehadsomeofourbest conversations withthestateandwiththe cityadministration andwithoutside lenders andbondholders andinterest intherecovery plan,thatreally isterrific . SoIthinkthefirstsixmonths, Davecancertainly supplement this,weare ontrackonrevenue ,weareontrackon expenses ,wearemeeting orexpectation s. Onthebigger issues intheplan,weare moving forward onthetimelinesbothforthe parking monetization .Wearemoving forward Ithinkbetter thanexpected ondifferent areasandoneoftheareasweareexceeding expectation isonthejudgment refinancing , andwearemaking significant progress on pension solution s. Asyoumightrecall,whenIwaslast hereIsaidallroadsleadthrough the pension problem .Thepension problem is whatneedstobesolved,andnotsimply because it'sapension problem .Ifyou don'tsolvethatproblem youcan'ttakethe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 pressure offtheproperty taxes,andthis planispremise donthelevering reliance on property taxesonagoingforward basis. TheCityofScranton 'sbudget is about30percent reliantonproperty taxes so60percent ofyourrevenue comesfrom sources otherthanproperty taxes.Ifany ofthoseotherrevenue sources failthat revenue cycleatanypoint,itbecomes stressed orwearenotabletocollect ,as wemightexpect toselect,itnaturally defaults toproperty taxes.Property taxes essentially thenyourownelastic taxthat youhave,sothisplanisverymuchpremised uponreducing thereliance onproperty taxes onagoingoutbasis. Youalso,asyouknow,havethis veryodddistribution ofassessed valuein Scranton .We,asamatter ofpolicy,have concerns aboutthatbecause wethinkthis bifurcated assessment thatyouhave,highon oneend,lowontheotherend,notproperly distribute d,isadisincentive toeconomic development because newconstruction sare beingtaxedatahigher number,soifyougo1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 upby10percent property taxesthat's already toohigh,apercentage ofyour population bearsthatmorethandoesthe restofthepopulation .It'snotproperly distributed .Addthattoanalready high, relatively highEITtax,arebarriers to economic development . Soweknowthatinorderforthe plantoworkandnotjusttofixthebudget shortterm,buttocreate thetimeofthe stability thatcredit markets lookat,that investors lookat,thatpeople whoare exploring economic opportunity lookatwe needsomething that'sreliable andstable andonethatlevers thatreliance on property taxes,whichisbig,andIthink, unfortunately ,averydifficult experience inScranton . Sowearefaralongonthejudgment negotiation .Wearefaralonginthe process ofparking discussions .Thereis stillalotofhomework todothere,alot ofduediligence taking place,alotof negotiation thatstillhastogoon.Weare inconversation swiththeSewerAuthority1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 andthatisprobably oneofthemost critical components ofthewholeplanand particularly ifyouwanttoreduce our reliance onthe205taxandwearedoing wellinthebasicassumptions oncashflows anddoingverywellontheassumptions on therevenue andexpenses.Dave,again,can certainly supplement anyofthesethings I'm saying,buttherehasreally beenavery, veryaggressive administrative pursuit of everyopportunity inside ofthebudget.You neverget100percent ,butit'smoving along pretty well. Withthat,oneareaIwouldliketo discuss andexplain istheconcerns Ihave onthepension .Obviously ,wehaveallbeen partytotheAuditor General 'sreport relative tothepension andit'salarming , andnotjustfortheunderlying conduct ,we willleavethattoothers tospeakabout, butitconfirms ourconcerns abouthow underfunded thepension really is,and pensions areaproduct ofactuarial assumptions ,thenumber ofpeople inthe plan,theexpected lifespan,thesalaries1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 intheplan,aswellasawholebunchof otherissues.Whatareyourratesof return,whatisyourrateofexpectedgrowth andexpenses . Soweareworkingwiththemayorand working withDave,working withthemayor's teamandbothinside andoutside counsel ,we wereveryconcerned aboutinsuring thatthe contract negotiations withtheunions would leadtoamorepredictable escalation than Scranton hasexperienced overseveral years. Sobywayoftheexample toputsome illustration around this,thereisan assumption fromyourPension Boardthatit willearn8percent ,andthatassumption is married toanexpected growth ofexpense of 5percent .Well,5percent isparticularly high,butthathadbeentheexperience of whatyourcontract sweregoingat,sooneof thekeycomponents ofourplanwasto negotiate thosecontracts inwaysthathad someveryobvious profit/lossbenefits ,but alsowouldhavealonger termbenefit onthe pension . Nowbecause wehaveacontrolled1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 growth inthecontract andasignificantly lowerrate,theactuarial experience changes dramatically andcouldbeveryfavorable to thecityandwillbeveryfavorable tothe city.Sothegrowth rateisnolonger 5 percent ,thegrowth rateisgoingtobe something closer to2percent ,andthat growth at2percent becomes afactor inthe actuarial 'sanalysis ofwhatthepension exposure is. Soifyoulook,forexample ,atthe localpension youwouldsaytheexpected rateofreturn is8percent .It's aggressive byanynational standard ,byany localstandard ,too,byouradmission ,and theyhadanexpectedgrowth rateexpense of 5percent .Thestatebycontrast predicts 5 1/2percent return,something more conservative ,moretrueforthe20or30 yearhistory ,buttheyonlyhavea2percent expense rate,sothespread forthestateis 31/2percent ,thespread forthecityis3 percent . Sowehavealready approved withthe statemodelbecause ofthecontracts that1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 havebeennegotiated toa1/2percent benefit inthespring predicting the pensions . That'sjustoneexample ofthevery connected nature oftheplanandallofthe things thathavetohappen inordertoget thisright,andI'llsayitagainandanswer anyquestions thatanyofyouhave,the pension obligation thatwillhitScranton in 2016andparticularly 2017iscompletely unsustainable ,andthereisonlyonewayyou canmakeupthatcostdifference whichis estimated tobeinexcess of$5million , thereisonlyonewaytodothatandthat's property taxesthat'syouhaveonthetable rightnowandyoudon'twantittobe reliantonproperty taxes.Thatcan't happen.Sotheonlywaytoavoidthatisto comeupwithothermeanstolowerthat pension obligation come2016and2017and theonlywaytodothatistosuperfundthe pension ,andtheonlywaytosuperfundthe pension istofindcashtosuperfundit,or tofindadebtmechanism tofunditwitha revenue stream,andthatiswhat'sgotto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 happen between thistimenowandsometime inthefirstquarter of2016forthisplan tocontinue totrack. MR.MCGOFF:Iguessthefirst question ,whatrevisions haveyoubeen forced tomakeintheplaninthisfirst18 months oftheadministration ? MR.AMOROSO :Thetwobiggest pieces werethatweoriginally assumed atripling oftheLSTbecause ofyourAct47status, andwealsoassumed awaytosuperfundthe pension wouldbeanAct205commuter tax, andifyourecall thecity'sargument was thattheresidents ofthecityalready paya veryhighEITtaxandtheywanted a relatively modest commuter taxoncommuters . Thatwasstruck downinCourtandan interpretation wasmadethattherehastobe somebalance .It'sunclear intheCourt decision whether ithastobeeven,butit lookslikepresumptively likeitmighthave tobeeven,soinordertohavea205taxwe wouldhavetoincreased theEITtaxbysome smallpercentage onScranton residents as wellascommuters togenerate whatwasin1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 ourplanroughly $5million ayearandthat $5million ayearwasaimedatbeingableto secure apension bond,sowenowhavetaken thatoutofthemodelbecause thereseemsto beareluctance togointhedirection of the205tax,atleastasanearlystrategy , andthatshould beanabsolute lastmoveif it'stotakeplaceatallifthereisawill toresolvepension s.Sowe'vehadtotake that$5million generating thesuperfund forthepension outofthebudget. Essentially it'snetneutral onthe budget because themoneythatwasgoingto beraised wasgoingtobeusedforapension bond.However ,thelegislature changed the lawandsaidifthecitydoesanAct205tax itwilllosethetripling effect oftheLST andtheLSTwillonlydouble andthat's aboutamillion pointfive,aboutamillion pointfivehittothecity. Sowithout the205taxandnowayto superfundthepension ,butwehavethe tripling oftheLSTandthattripling ofthe LSTcanexistonlywhileareyouinAct47. SoifyouaregoingtoexitAct47that1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 tripling oftheLSTgoesawaysowewould havetocomeupwithamechanism toreplace that$3million . MR.MCGOFF:Howhavetheunion contracts effected theplan?Havetheyin anyway? MR.AMOROSO :Yeah,favorably .I thinkinsomepart,youknow,union contracts arehardparticularly whenopening midstream ,andthereisageneral sentiment because thereissomanydifferent viewson contracts ,you'vegottoreally lookatthe costofthecontract notjustinwhatthe payincrease is,thereis2percent ,3p percent ,4percent ,butI'malsolooking at itinthecontract whathappens onthework rules,andworkrulesareanimportant aspect torenegotiating because theyreally effect costs,particularly around things likeovertime andthoseaspects . Sothecityhasacontract ,Ithink itnegotiated agoodcontract ,butithasto beabletomanage thecontract effectively andthat'snotaneasythingtodobecause youhaveaverytightbandwidth ,sothereis1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 someheadwindsthere,it'shardtomanage because youhavesometightbandwidth . Buttheimportant partofitwas thatthecitywasabletodeliver the2 percent increases ,whichwasonthemark,to trytotieitintothestates expected rate ofincrease andgenerally what municipalities orcapsarecalling forin different states,NewYork,NewJersey. Theyarecapping those2percent increase closer tothecostofliving,andthathelps usverymuchreestablish thepension integrity . Thereisstillmoretodoonthe pension s,thereisotherelements ofthe contract thathavetobenegotiated visavia thepension ,butthisisanimportant ,very important ,andverygoodfirststep. MR.MCGOFF:Twomorequestions , haveyoubeenactively involved inthe discussions withtheScranton Sewer Authority ?Sincewearenotpartofit sinceitisanauthority can'tact independently . MR.AMOROSO :Weareindiscussion1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 withthem.Theyhavehosted twoorthree meetings withthemayorandsomeoftheteam thatyouseeheretoday.Wedon'tthink thatwehaveadequate information to appropriately advise andguidethecity notwithstanding independent authority . Nonetheless ,thecityremains it'screator andaveryimportant stakeholder andwedo believe thatthereneedstobegreater transparency onsomeoftheprocess estaking place,though therehasbeenagoodflowof communication ,inorderforustoproperly advise thecityweneedtohaveaccess to moreinformation . MR.MCGOFF:Andlast,wasapayroll taxincluded inpartofyourbudget? MR.AMOROSO :Yeah,onthepayroll tax,itwasarecommendation ofthe Pennsylvania Economy League intherecovery plan.Itwasnotanactual partofour plan,butnotforanyotherreason,wejust didn'tputitin,butweendorse itand support itandwebelieve thatthepublic policy instituted bythestatehas commissioned astudyandwe'reawaiting the1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 results ofthatstudy,whichareforthcoming in30or45days,butitwouldbesomething thatIwouldfavor. MR.MCGOFF:Thankyou.Mr.Rogan? MR.ROGAN:Thankyou.First,I'd liketo,asImentioned thisduring the regular meeting aswell,Iwouldthankall ofyouforcoming intoday,especially Mayor Courtright .Injust18months wehavehad moreofthesesessions withyouallinhere thanwedidin12yearsontheprevious administration ,soonbehalf ofallof council wecertainly appreciate youcoming in. Mr.Amoroso ,youspokeabout long-termgrowth inthecity,canyoutalka little bitmoreaboutthatbecause Ithink thekeyto,andIthinkthegeneral public willallagree,thekeytogetScranton back ontrackisalong-termstrategy wherewe couldincrease homeownership inthecity, increase ourpopulation inthecityandget businesses backin,canyoutalkalittle bitmoreaboutallthat? MR.AMOROSO :Sure.Inourrecent1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 contract withtheChamber ofCommerce we werecharged withdoingresearch andmaking somerecommendations relative toeconomic development opportunities .Nomatter what youreadorwhatyoustudy,andthereisa number ofgreatbooksthatareoutthere rightnow,thereisactually abodyof academia building around whatworksfor distressed cities,andpartofwhatworks fordistressed cities isgetting abudget stable,stabilizing thebudget. Predictability inthebudget isimportant foranybusiness because theyhavetodo theirownplanning ,theirownbudget planning ,soiftherearewildcardsontax increases ,property taxincreases ,newfees, thoseitemsarealways happening andwithout somepredictability attached tothemthey can'tplanwellsotheintent tostayaway fromcities thatgothrough recovery without theelement ofpredictability . Second isveryimportant to recovering thecity'seconomic development isthestrength ofwhatwecallthecore competencies ofcities.Thecorecompetency1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 ofthecityareessentially policing ,fire protection ,Department ofPublic Works, recreational activities .You,ascouncil , don'thavecontrol overschools ,butalot offolkswhoinvest incities lookatwhat theschool realitymightbeinmaking those decisions . Sofromourperspective thereisan opportunity topromote economic development , butit'shardtodoinaheadwindof uncertain taxes,whether itbeEITor property tax,veryhardforthecity administration tositdownandgivea packageofincentives whenthestatehasn't really givenyouthoseincentives touseso it'salittle bitharder ina--it'sbeena zerosubgameforthemunicipalities inthe northeast inparticular totryandto attract business . Sowhat'sattractive isgoodhousing stock,goodcorecompetencies ,stable budget,stable school system,youhavegot theroadinfrastructure ,yougotthe location ,you'vegotthegreater attractions around Scranton ,theterrific opportunity of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 thecityonentrepreneurial activity ,but it'sjustnot--itcan'tbesupercharged . Itreally cannot bedeployed very effectively untilyougetthisbudget stuff done. Thepensions areareally darkcloud andnooneisgoingtowanttocometoa cityiftheycan'tfixthatissuethat's facing theprobability ofabankruptcy . MR.ROGAN:Andthegrowth issue thatwasexactlywhatIwashoping tohear because fromlooking atothercities in Northeastern Pennsylvania wearemuchsafer. Wehavethebestpolice department around, wehavethebestfiredepartment around,and Ithinkthathastobekeytothegrowth, future growth oftheCityofScranton ,that wehavegoodneighbor hoods,youknow,we havegreatfiredepartments ,andhopefully thatcanbeusedasanincentive topromote thecityinthefuture soIwasreally glad tohearthat. ForalloffiveyearsIhavebeenon citycouncil twothings Ihavebeensaying thecityshould doisreevaluate its1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 position intheScranton Parking authority andtheScranton SewerAuthority .Iknow youprobably can'tgetintospecifics because thereare,youknow,ontheparking endtherearebidsthathavebeenreceived andnegotiations aregoingon,butcanyou giveaupdate onwherethecurrent status of theSewerAuthority andtheParking Authority stand. MR.AMOROSO :Sure,totheextent I canwearedeeply involved inallofthe discussions relative totheParking Authority ,thecityhasassembled trulya firstrateteam,thateveryparticipant in theteamisworking inaweekly fashion with thephonecalls,withthemeetings ,strategy sessions ,tremendous loopofinformation . Themayorisdeeply involved inthat process ,soweareexcitedinthedirection whichit'sgoing.Ithinkthatcityis goingtoendupintaking whatisabad situation andmaking itasgoodasitcan be. AndtheSewerAuthority discussions it'sharder tohandicap rightnowbecause1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 we're--theSewerAuthority isrunning the process andtheyaresharing certain information withus,butwearehaving a good,healthy conversation withtheir representative .Timing onthatisprobably alittle bitdifferent thantheParking Authority ,andtheParking Authority discussion ,asyourecall,hasatimelinein thePELrecovery plan. MR.ROGAN:Andjustone,also,even though heisnothere,Scranton Parking Authority solicitor ToddJohnshasdonea greatjobcommunicating withcouncil , myself,anytimeIplaceaphonecalltohim wegetacallimmediately withanyanswers toquestions thatwehave. Andmyfinalquestion isregarding theCourtawardfromtheprevious administration withtheunions,andit's beenbrought upbysomeinthepublic at tonight 'smeeting ,it'sbeensomething that wehavebeendealing withinthecityfor welloveradecade,thefrustration onmy endformepersonally isthatweare currently paying interest onadebtthat's1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 continuing togrow.Atleastbyissuing bondsorhowever it'spaidoff.Granted,we willstillbepaying thatinterest ,which nobody wantstopay,butthedebtwill finally beretired .Canyoutalkalittle bitmoreaboutthepaying offoftheCourt award,andmaybethisistooearlier ,buta anapproximate interest rateofwhatwe wouldbepaying onthatdebt? MR.AMOROSO :Weareinvolved ,but Daveisreally theperson leading the strategy onthatandDavehasbrought itto theplacewhereitis.Justtoindicate wheretherecovery planis,iftherecovery planweren'ttracking asit'stracking proof wouldbethatwewouldnotbehaving the conversations withlenders tofundinthe marketplace thejudgment ofsatisfaction . Thefactthatweareabletoactually get bankers tomorethansitwithusandtalk aboutfunding thewholejudgment meansthat theyarebeginning tobelieve andhave confidence inthestructured planandthe teamthat'shere,andDave,Iwoulddeferto Daveonthatquestion ,buthehasverymuch1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 driven thatstrategy ,andthat'swhywehave theopportunity torefund thejudgment , refinance thisjudgment . MR.ROGAN:Doyoucaretocomment , Mr.Bulzoni ? MR.BULZONI :Well,whatIthinkI cansayit'stakenanincredible amount of creativity tomoveitalong.Wedidn't exactlyhaveanyinterested parties that wereveryserious aboutthecity'scredit in theearlystages oftheadministration last year,sowhatwedidputtogether Ithink wasafairly creative structure andthe Timeshavereported onitfairly thoroughly andhasreported onitwell.Muchmoreto come.Weobviously createdastructure whichinvolves theCommonwealth through the Department ofLaborandIndustry ,andat leasttodatetheyhavegivenussome favorable commentary onthestructure and howitisinvolving now.Wealsothrough working withvarious financing armshave looked atastructure whereobviously we wantcompetitive interest ratessopartof howwedrovethisprocess wastobeableto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 create astructure toallowustoissuedebt withcompetitive interest rates. Wewillbemeeting withbargain unitstodiscuss thematter soatleastat thispointintimeIcan'tgetintotoomuch detail beyond whatIhadjustcommented on, butIbelieve wearereasonably closeto beingabletoputittogether . MR.ROGAN:Thankyouverymuch,and again,I'dliketothankallofyoufor coming in,andjustafewyearsagoIwason council atthetimewhenthecitywaspaying itsemployees minimum wagebecause there werenofundsintheaccount andnobody wouldborrow tous--lendtous.Theend oftheyearwewereconcerned whether we wouldhaveaTANornot,andIknowtothe public,youknow,reading thepaperevery dayandseeing what'sgoingoninthecity thesethings maynotmeanalottothem,but theyareverylargestepsintheright direction ,sothankyouforallofyourhard workonthoseissues andthanks forcoming inagain.

SoItotally agreewiththat statement thatpoints theneedtocreate a timeline foreachoftheelements within the plansothat'swhyIconcur withwhat Councilman Wechsler istalking about,that's1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 whyit'ssoimportant forustoseea timeline,benchmarks,asprogress ismadeon oneitemwemovetothenextonebecause theyarelinked together andtheyareallin tandem,whenonehappens thesecond onehas tohappen sothat'svery,veryimportant , buttonight I'dliketoaddress someofthe partsoftheplanthattheremighthavebeen alittle progress ongetting things done. Forexample ,andthisisabig issue,reassessment .Weneeda reassessment .Scranton property owners are getting crushed byassessed values thatare basedona1970version ofScranton ,anda 1970'sversion oftherestofthecounty. Wherewehaveseenproperty values generally decline inthecity,theyhaveincreased in thesuburbs andthecurrent assessment does notreflect a45-yearchange.Sopartof theplanistoaskthemayor,andI'mnot suredid-- MR.COURTRIGHT :CouldIinterrupt forasecond?Iaskedthecurrent commissioners ortheprevious onesandthey verballytheyhadnointerest in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 reassessment sowewillbeseeing anew regimecomeinandIwillmakethatrequest again. MR.EVANS:Iagree100percent ,we havetokeeponbeating thedrumtoour property owners.Imean,it'sexacerbated bytherecent taxincreases ,ofcourse,but it'stheassessment that,youknow,andI I'marealestate broker soIcantellyou caseaftercaseaftercasewhereproperty ownersarejustgetting hurtbythe assessment .It'shurting oureconomic development . MR.COURTRIGHT :Itis. MR.EVANS:Ourhomeowners,it'sa travesty andwefinally havetoget something doneonthat. Pension reform,andthemayorandI havehadthisconversation before,too,it's asimple process ,Ithink,butit's something thatIthinkwouldsendamessage toeverybody inthecommunity ,financial community aswell,thatifthenon-unionor thecabinet members orhowever youwantto callit,wouldswitch overtoa401-Kstyle1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 planonagoingforward basissowecan finally say,lookit,hereiswhatweare doing,wearemaking theeffort,aspension reform isbeingdiscussed dailyin Harrisburg ,youknow,thatwouldsenda message Ithinktothefinancial community that,youknow,wearegetting ourhousein orderinthatsmallaspect. MR.COURTRIGHT :Ididn'tmeanto talkwhileyouarespeaking ,Iwasjust asking himaquestion aboutifthatwouldbe complex ornotforusto,Idon'thavea problem withdoingit,butI'lllet Mr.Bulzoni mightwanttospeaktoit. MR.EVANS:Yeah,Idon'tknowif thereisanylegalissues todoingitor anything ,butIthinkit'ssomething that-- anditisbeingaddressed inthenew recovery plan,revised recovery plan,soI thinkit'ssomething thatweshould puton thetable,andIthinkactually ,tobe honest withyou,Ithinkit'stothebenefit ofthenon-unionpersonnel because there'sa bigturnoverthere,thereismorepeople coming andgoingwiththeadministration ,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 it'saportable pension soIthinkitwould actually better foreveryone concerned . Monetization oftheSewerAuthority obviously isakeyplantothefundingof thepension s.WhileIagreeinprinciple , andIdo,without substantia reform tothe Pension Board,thepension ordinances and otherinitiatives ,wearegoingtobe putting goodmoneyafterbad,sowhat'sthe plantoavoidsomeofthescenarios that havehappened inthepast?Whatarewe goingtoputinplace,whatcontrols viaa pension ordinance orrevisionsofthe Pension Board,isthereanything intheplan rightnowtomakesurethatwesuperfund thepension ,wearenotturning itovertoa scenario wherewearegoingtogethurt again? MR.AMOROSO :Therearecurrent ly sessions taking placewiththestate relative tothelevelofparticipation support theyaregiving thecity,whichI'm surearegoingtohavesomeconditions attached to,andsomethatyoumightexpect wewouldhavetotherecent report.The1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 mayorhasloudly called forturning the pension management overtothestate. Inordertodothat,youwouldhave tocometocompliance withthestate requirements ,whicharealmost best practices .Ourbelief isthatisthebest interest ofthepension holders ,retiredand present ,togointothestateplan.That goingintothestateplanmeansconforming tothestateplan.Itdoesn'tmeanthe statepicksupthedebt,butIwouldtendto agreewithyouabsent thatwecanputmoney atrisk. MR.EVANS:Absolutely .Andweall agreedoncouncil thatthatwasamovewhen themayorannounced itthatweallagreed with,it'ssomething thatweseethatmust happen.Now,howithappens ,Iunderstand theunions havetotakeavoteandIdon't knowifthat'stheonlywaythatit'sdone, but-- MR.COURTRIGHT :Attorney Shrive is working togetsomebody fromPMRStocomeup here,Ispoketothemverbally ,someofthe unionheads,andtheyweren'topposed toit,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 buttheyhadquestions thatneeded tobe answered andsowefigured wewouldbring theexperts upsoheisworking tothatend tobringthemuphereandhopefully wewill haveafavorable outcome . MR.EVANS:Great. MR.SHRIVE:Whenwedohavethat meeting setupIwilldefinitely invite all ofthemembers ofcouncil tocomeinandsit inandhaveanyquestions answered thatthey haveaswell. MR.EVANS:Yeah,thatwouldbevery informativeandhelpmeout.Onthe settlement ,Idoagreethatthesettlement hastohappen obviously ,youknow,we continue togodownthatpathandnotpay thatoff.Ihavemadethestatement ,itmay besomething that'sdoable,itmaynotbe, butit'sthewayIfeel,thattheunions should havesomeskininthegame.Ifwe aregoingtopayout$24million --or borrow $24million theyneedorshould at leasttakeaportion ofthatandhelpfund thepension .Now,ifthat'srealistic or notasfarastheunions areconcerned I1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 don'tknow,frankly Idon'tcare,that'smy opinion andIhopetheystepupbecause thereisgoingtobeaprocess inplaceto superfundthepensions whichwillinclude thesettlement possibly ,theSSA monetization ,thepension bondissue,I thinkeverybody needstocontribute because thelarger amount thatgoesintothat pension fundthelessthepayment isgoing tobeandthemoresolvent thecityisgoing tobesothat'sprobably moreofastatement thanaquestion ,butIthinksomebody hadto sayit,I'mnotsurehowthisisgoingto flowbutthat'ssomething Ifeelvery important about. PILOTS.Now,obviously yourplan andtherecovery planaresortofmeshed now.Inthenewrecovery planaspartofa mandate ittalksaboutverification of property exempt fromtaxation status.This issomething thattookplaceinAllegheny Countythatworksvery,verywell,andwhat theydo--theCountydoesit,I'mnotsure wecangetthecounty todoit,I'mhoping atsomepointintimeit'smandated for20151 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 and2016intheplan,whatyoubasically do issendoutverification oneverysingle parcel that'sownedbyanonprofit andthat nonprofit hastosubstantiate orjustify why thatpieceoftheproperty ,ifitisexempt underthecategory ofpurely charitable organization orthrough theHUPtest.It's someheavylifting ,Iunderstand that,and something wehavetotalkabouthowthat getsdone,ifit'sthrough anRFPorifit's through someotheropportunity ,butIthink it'ssomething thatweshould discuss inthe plan.Ithinkit'sabattle,thatit'sa waytoaddress thePILOTS,because Ithink whathappens ,Iwasthedirector ofthe assessment office forawhile andwhenIcame intotheoffice Iputapolicy inplacethat whenever aproperty cameinitwas automatically deemed taxable anditwasup totheproperty ownertocomeinandtellus whyitshouldn 'tbetaxable . Thatpolicy haschanged andnowit basically ,youknow,itworkstheproperty comesinandit'slisted asanonprofit ,I don'twanttogiveanynames,butnonprofit ,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 theywillautomatically makethatproperty nontaxable .Wedon'tknowifthatis legitimate ornotbecause itcouldbean emptylot,ithasnobearing whatsoever on beingaPurelyCharitable Act. SoIthinkit'ssomething openfor discussion withthenonprofits asfarasthe PILOTS,itmightbesomething worthwhile having thatconversation withthemwhen you'remeeting withthem.Ioffered my services ,I'mavailable anytimetomeet withPILOTS ifyouneed,Icouldbeofsome help,butthat'sallIhaveonPILOTS. That'sanother oneofmypassions . MR.AMOROSO :IfImightechothat lastcomment ,oneofthelarger cities that weworked withwehavehelped themputthe process inforexamining justthat.There isabodyoflawdeveloping nowinanumber ofstates aboutreally whatconstitutes a nonprofit ,particularly thelarger institutions whohaveforprofit enterprise inside ofthem,andthereissomevery interesting decisions coming down,wecan shareoneofthemwithyou,butIcouldn't1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2599 agreewithyoumore. But,again,Scranton 'sfireis fighting somebigproblems andit'sgotto movethrough thesethings withamethodology thatdoesn'tmakeitsuchthattheir bandwidthcan'tbesuccessful . MR.EVANS:No,IagreeandIthink thatgoesbacktotheopening statement abouteverything beingdoneintandem and partofthebigger picture . I'lltouchalittle bitontaxes, whichwetalked aboutbefore.I'mafirm believer thatwecannolonger taxourway outofdistressed status.Everytimewe tax,havehigher property tax,wearelosing families ,we'relosing businesses , mercantile taxes,thetaxcertainly hasto go.

MR.SHRIVE:That'soneareathat wouldtighten uptheprocess andprovide for oneexpert inthatspecific medical fieldas opposed to,youknow,auniondoctor,acity doctor,afamily doctor andamajority rule typeofthesituation thatwasbefore.We havealsoengaged withanourthirdparty administrator forWorkers'Comptobring aboutbestpractices asfarashowtoreduce1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25110 theriskofdisability andworkcompinjury andtheyareexploring thataswespeak. Ithinkinthefuture youwillseea significant decrease inourdisability pension s,andIthinkthataturnoverto PMRSwillalsohelpalleviate thatissue. MR.GAUGHAN :Canweexpect anytime soonachange,something thatcomesdownto council legislation wiseamending the pension ordinances asitrelates to disability ? MR.SHRIVE:Onethingthatwehave toremember whenwearedealing withthe pensions isinPennsylvania allofthemare subject toAct111andthenegotiation process ,soanychanges thatwemakeona goingforward basiswouldhavetobeby agreement aswellasthePMRSchangeover, butyouwon'thaveanything tocouncil until wehaveanagreement onthespecific issues likewedidinthefirecontract withthe change tothewaythatthedisabilities are approved byonedoctor asopposed tothe three. MR.GAUGHAN :Right.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25111 MR.SHRIVE:Butwearedefinitely working onitandmeeting withtheunions to tryandmakeitdefinitely amoreefficient process . MR.GAUGHAN :Thankyou. Mr.Amoroso ,asyouarewellaware,backin January andFebruary of2015themayor renegotiated contracts withthefireand police unions.MayorCourtright saidthat weshould expect toseeupto$1million in savings fromthesenewcontracts .First, howarewetracking thesesavings ?Arewe abletoactually trackthesavings andwhere areweinthatprocess ?Howmuchhavewe savedandwillbeabletoseethat$1 million figure? MR.AMOROSO :Idobelieve youwill abletoseethe$1million figure. Remember ,partofthecontract requires ,as Isaidearlier inmyopening ,thatthecity beinaposition through it'sdirectorwho hasarelatively tightbandwidththatthey beabletomanage underthetermsofthose contracts .Soinordertoachieve those savings wehavetomanage things like1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25112 overtime ,wehavetomanage otheractivities andtherecouldbeunforeseen circumstances thatcouldjustify theovertime ,butthe cityhastomanage thataswell,it'snot easy.Itsounds likeitis,butit'snot easy,butthecontracts ifmeasured and scored doproduce amillion dollar savings . MR.GAUGHAN :Doweknowwherewe areatinthatprocess ?Canweactually lookatandsay,"Okay,sofarwehavesaved thismuch?" Arewe50percent oftheway through ? MR.AMOROSO :Idon'tknow.Again, Iwouldprobably deferthattoDave,but it'sprobably tooearlygivenhowsoonthat theyhavebeenimplemented . MR.GAUGHAN :Okay. MR.COURTRIGHT :IfIcouldsay this,Ispoketothechiefearlier this week,ChiefGraziano ,andhesaidtomethat ifwehadn'tdonethecontracts aswedidit thatwewouldhaveexpendedanadditional $300,000fromwhatweexpended nowandI believe Councilman Wechsler hasspoken to1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25113 bothchiefs,haveyounot? MR.WECHSLER :Correct ,andthatwas thesameinformation hegaveme. MR.GAUGHAN :MayorCourtright ,and thishasbeentouched onalittle bit,are westillontrackfor2016and2017tax increases asitrelates ,Mr.Amoroso mentioned the6percent in2016and4 percent to2017,arewestillontrackfor that? MR.COURTRIGHT :Ibelieve weare for2016,Ican'tseethatfaroutfor2017. MR.GAUGHAN :Okay.Isthere anything thatcouldhappen within theplan thatwould--anyshortfall thatweare looking atrightnowthatwouldcallforan additional increase ,higher than6percent ? MR.AMOROSO :Yes.Ifweareunable toresolvethepension issue,ifweare unable torefinance thejudgment ,ifwe can'texecute ontheparking monetization thewaythatmakessenseforthecityand kickthecandowntheroadtoanother day, thereisnoothersource ofrevenue thathas elasticity ,aspainful asitis,otherthan1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25114 theproperty tax.Soifthosethings don't happen,thisistheimportant partofthe plan,thattherehas--thepension billis goingtogoup.It'scertain it'sgoingto goup.Theextent towhichitgoesupisa function ofanactuarial calculation that willpotentially beimproved inthestate pension plan,butifwegivethestateto thestatepension plan,superfundthe pension ,whichmeansexecuting ontheSewer Authority monetization ofwhichyoufolks don'thavealotofresent control over,the parking monetization ,andtherefinancing of thejudgment atproper rates,thosethings don'thappen.Theyallproduce expenses thatarenotcalled forintheplan,greater thanwhatthecallsfor,thereisonlyone placeforittoland,property taxes. MR.GAUGHAN :Okay,thankyou.This wastouched onalso,butit'ssomething that'sbrought uptoallcouncil members regularly ,especially whenwe'reoutinthe public andIthinkthereisadisconnect people,don'tunderstand thedifference between personal bankruptcy orChapter 91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25115 bankruptcy ,socouldyoujustexplain what wouldhavetohappen forthecitytogointo receivership andbankruptcy andexplain that process .Isitagoodthing,abadthing? MR.AMOROSO :Well,personally ,and frommyexperience andfromwhatwestudy, okay,wedon'tseemunicipal bankruptcies as agoodthing,weseethemasabadthing. Theyareverydifferent thanpersonal or corporate restructures ,Chapter 7or11.A Chapter 9alsorequires approval ofthe state.SoeveniftheCityofScranton wanted togointobankruptcy youwouldhave topetition thestateandthestatewould havetosay,"Weapprove it." Thestatemightsay,"Wedon't approve thebankruptcy ,wedon'tthink that'sinthebestinterest ofthe Commonwealth ." Intheoverall picture ,bankruptcy couldeffect therestofourcredit,it wouldeffect therestofthesemarginal pension sand,therefore,wearegoingto appoint areceiver andareceiver isgoing tocometotown,areceiver isgoingtohave1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25116 protect therevenue .Thereceiver hasto secure therevenue .Soareceiver willcome totownandliftyourproperty taxesbecause theyhavetosecure therevenue stream. Soalotofpeople speakaboutlet's gobankrupt . MR.GAUGHAN :Right. MR.AMOROSO :Andthatfixesthe problems ,butIdon'tknowthatit'swell thought outwhentheysayit.Icertainly empathize withtheinstinct thatbecause of whattheyreadinthenewspaper,whether it bepersonal orwhether itbesome corporation somewhere ,itjustdoesn'twork thatwayinmunicipalities .Soinsomeof thesecounties theyhaveseenpensions cut inhalf,theCity'scredit destroyed and business leave.

MR.GAUGHAN :Ijusthavetwo questions ,whenwillthecityreceive a favorable bondrating?Isthereatimeline forthat?Areweclose,arewenotclose? Idon'tknowifyouwillabletoanswer that question . MR.BULZONI :Therehasbeensome discussion ,especially recently ,about actually approaching therating agencies to seeifwecansecure arating.Youknow, certainly therating wouldbealowertier rating atthispoint,nothaving arating is notpreventing usfromlooking atissuing debt,butcertainly having arating would openthedoorforustoachieve amore favorable debtstructure ,possibly secure insurance whichwould,again,dropthecost ofborrowing aswell. Thefactwearetalking aboutitnow isreally verysurprising .Initially ,when wefirststarted discussing thatprospect we werethinking maybetheendofnextyear.
