MR.WECHSLER :Onthequestion ? MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,onthequestion . Youknow,theoriginal intent ofthis legislation ,inmyopinion afterhaving several conversations withthebusiness administrator andothermembers ofthe administration ,wassimply toincrease commercial recycling andthereporting that goesalongwithitinorderthatthecity canapplyforandsuccessfully receive grants.This,asfarasI'mconcerned ,was alsoarecommendation fromtheDEPthatwe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 needed toupdate thisordinance ,otherwise , wewouldnotbeabletoapplyfortheAct 904Performance Grantthatwedoeveryyear. Iwouldagreewithsomeofthe speakers thatenforce mentisgoingtobean issueandIdon'tthinkthatthatwasthe intent ofthislegislation sothatwepass thisandthenallofasudden cityworkers aregoingthrough people'sgarbage .That's ludicrous .Idon'tthinkthatthatisgoing tohappen. Fromourcaucus lastweekwith Mr.LynchandMr.Bulzoni andtheour recycling consultant ,Ithinktheyare headedintherightdirection andIdothink thattherehasbeenprogress already in increase dreporting fromthedifferent commercial establishments ,soIwillbe voting "yes"forthis.Ithinkit's something thatweneedtodo,otherwise ,we willbeindanger oflosing funding .Thank you.

Sothisis,inmyopinion ,stepone, separate therecyclables fromtherestof therefuge,andasMr.Gaughan stated,the majorimpact onthisisgoingtobean increase our904grantmoneyfromthestate byactually getting ourcommercial businesses torecycle.Everyotherlocal community hasthisalready inplaceandit dictates tothemthattheynotonlyhaveto recycle buttheyhavetoreport backtous onhowmucharetheyrecycling andthatin turngoestothestatewhichtheniswhere thestategetstheinformation togivethe moneybacktothecityintheformofa1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 grant,whichcanbeusedtoturnbackinto ourrecycling program ,again,soyoucansee howthatcircle goes.SoIwillbevoting "yes"forthisaswell.
