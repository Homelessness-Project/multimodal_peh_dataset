MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON LACKAWANNA HEALTH & WELFARE AUTHORITY MEETING HELD MARCH 17, 2022. 3-B. OVERTIME REVIEW FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY CITY CONTROLLER DATED JUNE 23, 2022 FOR THE PERIOD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 JANUARY THROUGH JUNE 2022. 3-C. AGENDA FOR THE ZONING HEARING BOARD PUBLIC HEARING TO BE HELD ON WEDNESDAY , JUNE 29, 2022. 3-D. CORRESPONDENCE DATED JUNE 24, 2022 FROM MAYOR PAIGE COGNETTI REGARDING DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS MANAGEMENT CHANGES . MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Any change in the status of the union contract negotiations ? MR. DONAHUE : Negotiations are still ongoing . MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, I remind you that Ufberg's contract expired on March 31st. They were the only organization to put in a bid for the new contract . And we're getting kind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 of late in the game. You only have four more meeting s before your recess. We're now on day 179, 49 percent of the year is behind us. Speaking of the year, what is the status of the 2021 audit? MR. DONAHUE : We -- so Kelly Lindsey from Kohanski has been in touch with the administration . And they are going to be in the building this week for that -- for the end of June. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, they are only 28 days late by the Home Rule Charter . And they said now that they're going to have a product for us by September 30th. So I'll be watching . Speaking of things owed to us, back on June 6th the City received a letter from Lazor and McGovern with reference to the Payroll Preparation Tax. They had some questions about the status of taxing the self-employed and net rental income. Has the administration gotten any response to that that it could share with the public? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding that a meeting is being set and then that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 information will be shared. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. If you get anything on it, please make sure that gets into Third Order because wasn't the grace period through June 30th before people are expected to start paying that tax? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : So that's around the corner. Oh, and I could not believe it. There is a machine at the Pocket Park making little pieces of concrete out of big pieces of concrete . So I think that is the first activity there in well over a year. So progress is being made however slow. MR. DONAHUE : As soon as those pieces are small enough, they're going to be taken out of there. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yep, okay. Item 5-B, the HUD Annual Action Plan, my only question was I saw that it was, you know, for a period beginning on January 1st. Is there some reason why this is six months later? Do you just do that like that every year? MR. DONAHUE : So we got into this rotation I believe starting last year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Normally we would award this in November . But then the money wouldn't come from HUD until the following October . So instead of awarding money and having people like organizations have to wait a year for it, we pushed it and it doesn't affect the HUD funding whatsoever . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. That's fine just as long as we weren't caught surprise d by this. And I saw the article in the paper about the walkability study. I wasn't able to go to the presentation last night because I had a board meeting . But I've been living in downtown Scranton since 1999. And I haven't had a car since 2012. So I'm a bona fide pedestrian downtown . And I don't have an issue with the concept of the walkability study per se. However , I will say this. There are some longstanding problems with regard to downtown pedestrians and city pedestrians all over that need to be addressed and not forgotten . For example , I think, you know, it's nice that we're looking at bike lanes for downtown Scranton . We also have systemic problems throughout the City and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 neighborhoods . For example , there are a lot of streets where there's foliage and bushes and trees and people have to walk in the street. And a lot of people do have to walk for whatever reason, maybe to catch a bus. The downtown traffic signals need a lot of adjustment because I, as a pedestrian , I push that button, nothing happens . So you have to guess and just dart across the street. In the wintertime when we do have snow or ice, a lot of the plows just push it to the curbs, which becomes an issue for anybody with a walker or a motorize d chair. And there are a lot of people like that living downtown . And the other thing is, I don't like bicycles coming up behind me on a sidewalk . And anybody that creams me is going to get sued with their pants off. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is John Thomas. MR. THOMAS: Good evening , Council . John Thomas, lifelong City resident . Well, I'm here about the same thing. I hate coming back because you have more important things to do. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 All right. Last Friday afternoon I went to City Hall. They told me -- I was there and about the noise at Levels Bar. He wrote down on a piece of paper 9:00 they are suppose d to stop. I went to Levels Bar at 1:00 in the afternoon . You can't get in the front. It's closed. They're fixing up. You have go around the back and it's open. And they serve lunches and drinks. I gave the paper to the man and the owner working at the bar. And he looked at it and he said 11:00. It's two hours over. I said I was fine with that. He said okay. I was ready to walk out and he said wait a minute. And I came back. I'm this far. I had to lean up against the bar because I only could stand for five minutes . The stool was too high. He says, I'll play music as long as I want and 2:00, 3:00, 5:00 in the morning if I want to. I said you can't get away with it. I wasn't going to argue with this man. I don't have the strength . He's 45 years younger than me. So I walked out. I went back to my apartment . As I told you last week, my apartment is a three-minute walk to the back of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 the bar. I don't know what to do with this situation . I feel I'm up against a brick wall, and I'm not going to win. Excuse me. I feel that man bullied me and belittled me. And I'm not backing down. I only hope this City can do something about it. I want to thank you for your reference , your consideration on my part, Council . And you have a nice and safe vacation . That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Thomas. We did forward your complaint from last week onto the police department and also code enforce ment. I don't believe we've receive d a response yet. Have we, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet, sir. MR. DONAHUE : But we'll follow up tomorrow and see if we get anything back from them, okay? MR. THOMAS: They were closed last night. Sunday night they stopped at 2:00 in the morning . Thank you for your consideration . MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Next on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 I didn't even want to come tonight . I thought I would give everybody a break. Then I read this ridiculous article about a walk around downtown for $240,000. What are you people thinking whether it's federal money or not. I never heard of such a ridiculous waste of money. How many people have ever come before Council and said they want streets changed and don't like the way the sidewalks are, they need help walking around the city? You get these out-of-towners who want to come in here and change everything like Biden Street. That is from an out-of-towner. Now, we got some out-of-towners telling us how to maneuver around the city. Where I live, I'm at North Main Avenue. There is 150 year old slate sidewalk s and no sidewalks in places right on North Main. Why don't you take some money and fix them? No, I don't expect nobody from this City for North Main. It all goes downtown for a bunch of developer s and LLCs that do their utmost not to pay their share of taxes. I don't know. It 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 just gets worse and worse in this City for a taxpayer . I talk to people that are just -- they know they're going to suffer like the dickens when the reassessment comes. But I bet you it doesn't affect downtown . They'll be having lawyers and somebody take care of their reassessment . Walk around downtown . Cars pay the taxes to be on the street, not bicycle s and not people. There don't need to be a path for people anywhere except the sidewalks . It's time this Council grew up and started thinking about the people that pay for everything . Well, you know these out-of-towners come here. It's like somebody writing a book about Elvis Presley that never met him. They don't know the people in this city. And they don't know the streets. And they don't even know the downtown that they want to change. That's enough giving you guys the dickens , I guess. Now, I want to say something good. Every single day I go and take my little puppy summer and winter up to Weston Park and walk around the swimming pool and around the park. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 He has a little route he follows around the trees. When you come in, the pool is on your right. There's a huge parking lot on your left. Are you familiar ? Why can't you guys take some of this $240,000 federal money and make tennis courts down there? You can't find lifeguards. It wouldn't take any lifeguards to have a tennis court. Three or four of them would fit in there. It's about half the size of a football field. And there's lights there. I don't know if you ever noticed this, there's big spotlights all around that. I think there is four of them or six of them. It wouldn't even necessarily be for young people. It would be for everybody . I don't think there is any tennis courts in town. I don't know. I was told there wasn't. Anyway, I'm sorry. I was so infuriated . But I'm sick and tired of people from out of town coming in here and dictating our lives. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next on the list is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Lee Morgan. Well, you know, I listened to Ron speak tonight and the speaker before me. And the City has a lot of obstacles in front of it. I think the University of Scranton though gave the City $100,000 to put lights up in the park that was going to take the place of the South Side Sports Complex about a decade or so ago. There is no doubt that our City is in a lot of trouble . I don't think that the young people seem to realize that some day they are going to inherit this City. There's a bridge on South Webster Avenue that has both sides of it closed to pedestrian s to walk when you leave the exit for McNichols Plaza. This City, people really need to rewrite the charter in this City. And the residents really need to come forward and hear what needs to be changed . Now for me to stand here in five minutes and explain to people how we can turn this City around, it's not possible . It would take a couple hours because I've only been coming to Council since I've been in my mid20s. The same thing when I opposed construction of the new school because of where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 it was. And you saw what happened to Central High School. We've had a terrible group of leaders in this City for decades . You know, I've never badmouthed anybody from the Council podium except the President of the United States. This president is the worst president in our history . And I'm really ashamed to say that we named anything after that man. And now we find out that he was mixed up right in the deal for his son. It's right on the laptop. And I just find it not to be humorous but to be really so petty for a government to run roughshod over its citizen s and name something after somebody because he's a Democrat and he's corrupt . And, you know, Scranton has had its share of corruption . We just lost a Mayor. But he didn't get charged for what happened with the Scranton Parking Authority and a lot of --and the Scranton Sewer Authority . And there's never been any real discussion about what happened to the reserve fund and how it got reinvested into the Sewer Authority . So what I'm saying to people here today is, we need to really sit down and talk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 about this City. Now, as I stated here before, my father was a master carpenter . So I know how to do cement work when I was a kid. And I knew how to build a lot of things. I didn't what know what it was called. My father would just say, come here I'm going show you something . This is what we're going to do. And that's the way it went. But a lot of -- in the city went to school, night school to learn how to put curbs and sidewalks in this city. I think Mayor Hickey was the Mayor. He killed the whole program . This city would have beautiful sidewalks in it now. We've had a lack of vision of a city here for a long time. There's a lot of people that have been making a lot of very bad decisions here. You know, taking a look at the taxes and, you know, doing all that stuff on the county level is just a complete waste of time because the residents of this city can't pay any more tax. And the money that was sent here to stand the City up has been squandered and wasted. You know, I hope I have the opportunity to speak to the residents of this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 City over an extended period of time and tell them how we can turn this City around. And people should look at what I said when I ran for Council seats. I never really campaigned for those seats but I knew the direction to go in. And when I ran for state represent ative, I explained to people how to get rid of property tax. It's unbelievable that we have all of these people we've elected and I'm only a truck driver who spent my whole life in studying government. And I could stand in a room with anybody no matter where they come from, whether it's the legislature or anywhere and talk about government. We aren't dumb. We're not uneducated . Okay, and we know what we think and we know why we think it. And life teaches a lot of lessons . It's just a shame we elect people who think they know things but they never attended a public meeting in their life. And look at the Scranton School District . It needs to be reorganized immediately . And we need to start educating our children with the education I received as a child. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . First off, I'd like to say something about East Mountain where they are paving. They paved all around the whole mountain , yet they left one stretch by the dam on East Mountain Lake. A couple hundred feet they could have paved from there to Derby. And it's all holes and bumps. And they should be brought back over to finish the pave job because it didn't make any sense. Everything else is paved. The other part of it is, I'm going to reiterate a little of what Lee said. You people and the Mayor allowed Biden signs to go up all over. You took our voice away. Mr. Donahue , Gaughan , the rest of you were the leaders here. You took our voice away to hear what we had to say whether we agreed putting Biden's name on it. The man is an absolute fool. And he's making an ass out of us worldwide . And every one of you, can you stand here and say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 you're proud of him what he's accomplishing ? I don't think so because he hasn't accomplished a thing. In our industry , the transportation , he's burying us, shut fuel off. You're paying the price to run those trucks down the road because of his incompetence . Yet you still won't take the signs down. Put it on the November election and let us decide what hell we want in our city, not for your political goals our your political person. It makes no sense why we suffer. Thousands of cars going on Interstate 81 see those signs. They could put signs up Scranton next exit just like they do Throop, Dunmore and everywhere else. We don't need Biden's name on the interstate. You want to keep him in the city here, make fools out of all us, that's your choice. I'm sure when election time comes around, we're going to make a lot of changes . And you guys all see it coming. The other part of this that just -- I don't even know how to put it in words. The Mayor stood out here with a bunch of people about AR-15s. I don't think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 she knows what the hell an AR-15 is or a side arm. We have a police officer sitting right here. Do you see him carrying an AR-15? He carries a side arm, generally a Glock with 14 rounds. You don't need an AR-15 to murder children or people at a mall or anywhere else because it's all close proximity . You could do all your shooting right in here without an AR-15. It's called security and common sense and use your darn brains to protect our people. And it's not from an AR-15. It's from anybody carrying a weapon into that building . All of those people in Texas that stood down, all the police officers should be immediately fired because the story is when you put a gun and badge on, it's to protect and serve. They didn't do a damn thing to protect those kids and two teacher s. That's what's wrong with the system. So if you are going to talk about weapons , get an understanding what a weapon really is and what it can do. You don't need an AR-15. AR-15s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 don't kill. It's mad sick people that do the shooting . They could do anything they want with any type of weapon. And that's where we got to step up our security to our people in this community and educate better builders and people that our places are secured, especially for our kids because they have no defense . And every one of those people should be fired and never allowed to carry a weapon or protect anybody because they were part of killing these kids. It was just -- I can't put it in words what I saw and in other places. And here in the City you took Nay Aug Park -- I filed suits to stop the park -- Nay Aug Park from doing anything with Geisinger . You filled the pool in. You want us senior citizens to come out to a splash park with our walkers and everything else? That's what you want us to do? We're the ones that pay for this damn city. Yet, you took it away from us, gave it to Nay Aug for $100,000 a year while I filed suit to get 7, 800,000 a year or you could have went to Geisinger and said donate the money and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 do the park in our name. But, no, everybody sat down and made again, more blunder s and the mismanagement of this City. But tell the seniors we have nowhere to go to swim. We got to go up to by the splash park in West Side and maybe our care handlers can push us in our walkers . Thanks. MR. DONAHUE : Weston Park is open -- or Weston Field is open all year round. The swimming pool at Weston Field both outdoor and indoor are open all year round for senior citizens . MR. BOLUS: -- you got to remember this is the City of Scranton . (Inaudible ) splash parks. It would make it convenient for everybody not like -- MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Bolus. Next on the list is Delmar -- I can't read that last name. MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , taxpayer . MR. DONAHUE : But you're not a resident , right? MR. GUZIEWICZ : That's correct . I'm a taxpayer in the City of Scranton . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MR. DONAHUE : I'll make you a deal. I'll give you five minutes tonight , just please just get to your point, I guess. MR. GUZIEWICZ : Thank you for being so polite about it. I believe it's undeniable that the City of Scranton and the entire Wyoming Valley would benefit immensely from reestablishing the Laurel Line. The Laurel Line as we know is the old Scranton Wilkes-Barre commuter rail service that stretched from Dunmore to Wilkes-Barre. And the community desperately needs that to be returned . Now, we just voted -- or you guys just voted last week to send a lobbyist down to DC in order to get some funds for the area, which included as wanting to build the railroad from New York City to Scranton . With those funds we can also continue to build a much shorter line from Scranton to Wilkes-Barre to alleviate many problem s in this community , which include the congestion and pollution of I-81 with over 20,000 Americans dying from emission -- auto emissions pollution every year.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 We can alleviate that in our community by cutting down the amount of cars we have on 81. We can make the city more walkable by having fewer cars. We just had the past two weeks discussing walkability . I imagine that has been going on further . Some members of Scranton don't even have cars to getting in and out of the City is difficult with our very limited bus systems , especially as Colts and the LCTA have to work together in order to get that transfer . It's very difficult as anyone who commutes between Scranton and Wilke-Barre knows the bus is not a serious option. Additionally , we've had some comment s tonight about noise complaint s, which railroads will cut down on by reducing the amount cars on the road. The number one source of noise pollution for an automobile is rolling resistance which trains by and large do not have. And it also will help bring people into the City of Scranton for commerce and trade, creating an economic corridor that we discussed privately last week would help 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 strength en the entire community and give us a strong financial backbone so that way we can invest more on ourselves and other members of our community rather than at corporate chains that siphon our finance s away and into their own pockets. Now, as for what the last guy said about the commuters -- about the communal swimming , the original Laurel Line did have a stop at Nay Aug Park. It's one of the most important stops on the line for people to visit on the weekend s. Revitalizing the Laurel Line will allow people to come and visit the park, use its amenities as well as visit the other faculties in the area such as the Everhart Museum, small businesses such as the Black Box Cafe provides better transportation to people who need to get to the hospital either for their own needs or as part of employment . I don't know when the last time you guys were up in Nay Aug Park during the day. But the amount of cars that are parked there constantly is horrifying . At the very least bringing commuter s off the roads onto the rail 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 line will cut down on pollution , improve public safety, improve business opportunities as more people will be walking in the City and thus spending at the small business es on the streets instead of driving past the city to get to Dickson City shopping at Target, at Wal-Mart, these other big box stores that are draining us of our finances . Any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : I don't have a question . I do have a comment . MR. GUZIEWICZ : Yes. MR. DONAHUE : So -- I don't know if it was necessarily a train service . But there was suppose d to be a joint Luzerne and Lackawanna County interconnect ivity study that Lackawanna County unfortunately backed out of. So a lot of times for the federal money you are talking about, you need some type of study on a shelf to be able to show to get that money back in then. I do understand your point too. MR. GUZIEWICZ : Additional one last comment is that the City of Wilkes-Barre just approved a study to investigate rail service to and from Philadelphia . Meaning that both Scranton and Wilkes-Barre should these projects 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 go through will have established rail lines and railroad stations that could then be easily linked at significant ly lower cost to reestablish the much needed Laurel Line. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . And I feel a little more polite about the walkability study. But I don't really feel that the streets are wide enough for two way and bicycles and parking on both sides. We have a few streets that we set aside no parking . And I'm a little concerned about that. It's just changing things around every time, every year or every couple years. And I do agree with the 20 mile an hour speed limit in downtown. And I also mentioned in prior City Council , years ago I turned a corner a certain time of year on Lackawanna Avenue and the sun is -- overhead as much at the mall -- the main entrance to Boscovs . All of a sudden, there was a lady in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 front of me, a pedestrian . And I didn't hit her or even come close. But some times people might make a mistake and hit the gas pedal instead of the brake. I have pretty large tires on me. So I thought of something down in the audience . And Mr. Basalyga could possibly be interested or influenced to put a big solar panel up there to block the sun away and he could take advantage of the electricity that it would generate or something like that, anything . But there is certain things that were ignored for years. And I'm pretty sure there was two or three people killed at that corner over the last 10 or 15 years. So that is something we really need to consider with walkability . And turning to once again we had a surprise visit. I wish these people that come in here and bash the daylights out of Joe Biden would watch these hearing s with the Congress . And there was a witness today that exposed that this was one big conspiracy for January 6th all along. And right out of the president 's -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 former president 's mouth was, so what if they hang Mike Pence or something to that order. So if you could see it online or whatever , it will be on MSNBC, channel 24, Comcast tonight an analysis of it. It's really concerning . It's just ungodly. Mark Meadows was the staff supervisor and he sat there playing with his cell phone while people were breaking into the capitol , nothing done. The president was tossing his dinner against the wall, taking a fit. You know, it's just unbelievable . And these people come in here and how terrible . As far as the fuel costs, things aren't going very good in Ukraine right now. And we had better resolve ourselves because if Mr. Putin blocks off the entire Black Sea border to Ukraine , there's going to be 400 million people and north of Africa and the Mediterranean in starvation mode next year. And that's going to cause even more instability . And he's threatening nuclear war if we don't like it, okay. They're telling their own citizens , oh, well, if there is a nuclear war, we're all orthodox Christians and we'll die and go to heaven. Well, gee, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Mr. Putin, I think it would be better if you die but we can't hope for gifts like that. And it's just entirely ridiculous . I mean, I didn't really agree with it. But as far as I'm concerned , Joe Biden is about 350 times better than what we had. Thank you and have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . Who on the Council is representing us in the County's reassessment effort? MR. DONAHUE : No one at the moment. MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon? MR. DONAHUE : No one at the moment. I don't see where we would fit into that process on Council . MS. SCHUMACHER : I could. But maybe I'll do that next week. Mr. Schuster , how much is left in this first tranche of the rescue money? MR. SCHUSTER : I'm not sure how much is left in it. What we were given was an outline . So I don't know what has actually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 been spent at this point in time. I don't think -- has any of it been spent? MR. DONAHUE : All I know is we should be getting a report within the next couple weeks. MS. SCHUMACHER : Prepared by who? MR. DONAHUE : By the director of the program . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I certainly think you should be there. I noticed in the earlier ones it wasn't even mention ed that they took 5.5 right off the top for the budget this year. So I think you should at least ask for a regular -- and I mean short intervals . MR. DONAHUE : We're going to get quarterly reports . MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, that's not enough. They could have it spent by then. And I would like to see also if you have it is what their priority is for whatever the balance is and spending that. I think that's imperative that we find out, you know, where they've allocated it and make sure that it doesn't get switched out. Regarding the audit, I have a quick 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 change here but has anybody ever talked to the two committees that have -- that operate on a different fiscal year that are always the holdup for the audit being done on time? Has anybody ever asked those two to change to the same fiscal year as the rest of the city? MR. DONAHUE : I don't know what that process would like look like. But I do know that the Sewer Authority and the Parking Authority were on the June list and not the one for August on what the auditor needed. So we'll see if -- we're going to get an update this week -- MS. SCHUMACHER : -- parking really? MR. DONAHUE : So we got an update from the auditor . They said they needed certain things by the end of June, certain things by the beginning of August and parking and sewer I believe were both on the June list. So we're hopeful to get an update this week on whether the auditor received those items. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Now last night at the walkability meeting , which I did attend, they talked about a bike study that has already been done by the City. Has that ever 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 been in the Third Order? MR. DONAHUE : I don't remember ever seeing the bike study. That was suppose d to be a part of the connect ivity plan with Lackawanna and Luzerne counties that never took place. But I don't remember -- at least on my time on Council the City actually -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, I mean, they said that last night, you know, well, the City's already got their bike plan. I would love to see that too if you could try to get a copy of that. And it's been a long time since Scranton Tomorrow has been here. MR. DONAHUE : They are coming in July 19th. MS. SCHUMACHER : July who -- MR. DONAHUE : July 19th, Scranton Tomorrow is coming in. MS. SCHUMACHER : And in the past we were told it was quarterly , I believe . Is -- MR. DONAHUE : We're going to be quarterly moving forward , yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Now, the split of the property taxpayers and tax exempt companies for lack of a better term, has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 anybody checked on what that split is right -- currently ? MR. DONAHUE : On who actually pays taxes and the tax exempt, I believe it's 37 percent . But I'll get a number for you for next week. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, usually it varies there. But I would like to know what it is now. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I watched the reassessment meeting with County Commissioners and the introductory session on it and I was thoroughly unimpressed. And fortunately I was not there to bring up a question . One of the points they brought up is to bring this assessment into place is that they are going to use a 30 month rolling comps, meaning going back for comparable sales of properties in the last 30 months. That's all well and good. But the comps that they are getting are unnaturally inflate d because of hyper low 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 interest rate. That is not the case anymore and that will not be the case. There is no way for them to draw when pulling comps non sales because houses aren't selling because the interest rate is going up to 4, 5, 6 percent . You cannot build. You cannot pull a comp that says property values have fallen because the data won't be there because you're pulling it from house sales. I have an issue with that formula . Tonight was brought up the Home Rule Charter . I brought it up beforehand and my main concern with it at this point is the lack of teeth in the Home Rule Charter . If there is misconduct , if there is any issues within the City that are brought to question , the Ethics Board is there. But there is no real teeth to stop it immediately and put it forward without a six to nine month review by the Ethics Board before they come to a decision about what they might do or might not want to do. The Home Rule Charter should have penalties in there for bad behavior . It should be if you violate the office, if you violate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 the oath, if you violate the trust of the city you're removed . Not we'll go through committees and we'll think about it or we'll talk about it or we'll look into it. If evidence is proven, your job should be forfeit . And unfortunately , the Home Rule Charter does not have teeth built into it as an enforcement mechanism to say that if this happens there are these penalties . That's a part of the Home Rule Charter that I think is lacking . I would like to thank Sheetz Gas Station . This week they've lowered gas to 3.99 a gallon and 3.49 a gallon for flex fuel at their station s. This is going through the 4th of July holiday . And unlike other station s that have stayed incredibly high, this station also provide s free air for tires. I'd like to thank them for taking a small hit of reducing gas prices in this time of the holiday season for the population in this area. And last, when the gentleman came from Wilkes-Barre came before us to speak, it was questioned whether or not he had the right to speak before here and he was allowed to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 speak this time. Rules of this body Article 5, Section 1, regulations of Council specifically state in them that they follow the Sunshine Rule. The Sunshine -- and they actually quote the chapters . The chapter in particular is 710.1 for public participation . Residents of the political subdivision or of the authority created by a political subdivision or for taxpayers of the political subdivision get to speak before this body. If he works here, he pays city tax. If he pays city tax, he has the right by law to speak before this body. To stop him from doing so and interfering is a violation of the Sunshine Rule as that's part of Council 's direct articles and of the Sunshine Law. And I thank you for allowing him to speak today because he really did have some interesting information . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. SHAW: Good evening, Council , Darwin Shaw, City resident . Let's get straight 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 to the top so I could work my way down. There has been a law passed let's say Roe v. Wade you would say. And it is a -- it stripped women of their rights. I am -- I am for -- I am a prolife individual . I am. And I do believe that life form starts at conception . I do. But I am not okay with being a father of -- a number amount of females -- knowing a number of amount of females even have a beautiful fiancee being forced if anything tragic happens to her -- tragic happens to her to have a child. That is mentally going to destroy not only the child but the system itself if we go back let's say 50 years when women came so far and fighting for their rights, that's one. So I would like Mr. Donahue when you do get up to the state level because that is a state problem that you can do something . I do stand for pro-life, but do something for the women so they do not lose their rights. As females , they deserve to get treated with respect alone and in a market with men that they are not getting paid equally . Number two, I like the gentleman 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 comment s that he does say and he does have the right to speak due to him paying taxes. But those comment s pertaining to the railroad s are most likely utilize d in the commission ers office when it comes to the trail line. If you want to speak to somebody , I think Jim Notarianni is the individual you should talk to. He's the one who does -- he loves trains. And the commissioners , they will help you. And honestly , if you do speak to the Councilmen , please be polite to my friends , you know, because they do work hard. Number three, flood mitigation -- no, not flood mitigation . The Mayor is -- 3-D. The Mayor is sending correspondence , I guess, to rework the organization between the public worker management system. Can we, please, investigate Chris -- what is his name? I'm sorry, I wrote it down -- Jenkins , Mr. Jenkins , not only for mismanagement of funds but taking a truck off the line when it pushed garbage back. I would like to know when Rubicon is coming in to be held accountable for their actions of setting our City back a couple days, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 setting our garbage back a couple weeks and putting more strain on our trucks in the system and you individuals . The other one would be the pools. Is there any plans or any ideas as to what is going to be done with the pool and not McDade -- yeah, McDade Park? MR. DONAHUE : McDade Park is a county pool. Nay Aug, we're going to have a couple more meeting s over the next few weeks before we come back for a public presentation . MR. SHAW: Thank you. Thank you. That's wonderful . That's a big project . So, you know, there has to be a lot of sitdowns with that. That is progress and, you know, it will get done. Yeah, flood mitigation , we would just go there -- no, not even flood mitigation . When it comes to walkability , that nonsense let's just call it, fixing our sidewalks . Is there a proper way that we could take the money from the liquid fuels account to not only pave the roads but also spruce up the sidewalks because downtown I remember as a child, they used to -- they used to sparkle a little bit.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 They used to be really, really nice. You know, it is more expensive material to use, but I'm pretty sure if they sit down and they come up with a realistic budget that is honestly surplused and not just balance d and presents it to Council properly , you guys have no problem investing in something that will not only bring revenue to Scranton but also attract individual s to be comfort able to walk around and enjoy the city. And then it will help with blight I believe . But that is another issue to deal with on top of these other problems . What else, the schools . If -- who would I have to talk to about getting the steps at McNichols Plaza fixed because there's children that use that -- those stairs, let's say. And if one of them fall, I don't know who is liable of a lawsuit because that is -- that's a big problem . I can't even walk down those stairs honestly, nor walk safely in the street when I tried to step off the sidewalk so individuals could walk past with their family. It is dangerous along with the bridge that is over there. I don't know -- I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 don't know the street. But if we're going to do a walkability study of downtown Scranton , at least can we utilize the safety areas where children go to school? MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. For the steps, that would probably be the director of operations for the school district . And in terms of South Webster Avenue, I actually had a conversation with Eileen Cipriani today and we're working on getting that going. The bridge is actually structurally sound there. It's just the sidewalk s that were added to the bridge, sort of eroded. But that fix will be dealt with shortly , I believe . Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Not at this time. I know I mentioned about -- I did mention about the there is going to be a movie up at Robinson Park. That is actually in July. I believe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 it's midJuly, maybe July 16th. I will try to get some more information on that. But it's the first time they're doing something like that, an outdoor movie for families . That will be pretty nice for families up in the East Mountain . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I guess just a few comments . I have some questions , Mr. Voldenberg . Last week we put out a couple correspondence over to the administration looking for schedule s for the land bank properties , also the drainage basins and street sweepers . I did see that we got the basin -- an answer on the basins from American Water. MR. VOLDENBERG : We did, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Is it possible we could send that over to DPW as well to see if the lines on the City end if there's a maintenance schedule for those basins? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Also, Rubicon , did we hear anything on the request to have Rubicon come in or any of the questions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 answered from the administration on Rubicon ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Nothing as of this afternoon , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. I do have a couple addresses which I sent over earlier in the day, three addresses in the 900 of Quincy Avenue, one on Hawthorne Street, Tenth Avenue and Garfield . So I will just follow up with you later on -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I have them, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. That's all for today. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a few comments . I hadn't mention ed earlier , but I did want to make sure to point out that the CDC has now approved COVID vaccines for children six months through five years. So there are the two that are approve d. There is a Pfizer and Moderna . The Pfizer is a three dose injection . And then the Moderna includes two doses that will be four to eight weeks apart. And you could contact the pediatrician or physician offices for those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 vaccines . And part of why I wore my mask for so long was because of my daughter at home who is 15 months old. And she was finally able to receive her first vaccination dosage. So I feel a bit better about that now. The other thing that I wanted to bring up, I know many people during citizens participation talked about the walkability study and the presentation that took place last night. Unfortunate ly I was not able to be there. I will catch up with it because I know it was on ECTV. But I'm personal ly excited about improving the walkability of our -- of our city and downtown . I know that it could seem like we're more focused on downtown. But just because we have some efforts downtown , does not mean the other neighborhood s are excluded from our efforts . And I think that we need to have a successful and a busy downtown to ensure the success of the whole city. And we've been working towards that over the years. There is still improvement that needs to happen. I know when I'm down there for First Friday, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 amount of pedestrian s that are around, the feel of the city, I want to -- I want to see that every weekend not just on First Fridays during the summer. And I don't see why people would not be interested in that as well. I am in total agreement that we need to address the sidewalks throughout the city. I've been working with the administration and have ongoing conversations on how we could do that because that is going to be a very large scale project . I know I've looked at replacing my sidewalks in the front of my property before. And I've been quoted at least $2,000 for really a small amount of space. So if you're taking care of sidewalks for an entire block, that's going to be thousands and thousands of dollars . And it's a prevalent issue throughout the whole city and in many neighborhoods . So then, you know, how do we approach it? Do we -- if we take care of one neighborhood at a time that's going to be an issue for people because then it's, you know, why are we focusing on South Side and not North Scranton . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 But looking at like a larger program and what's going to be most impactful for our City to increase the walkability and the amount of pedestrian s because I know I would like to be able to use the sidewalks more. And that's I think very a important issue for us to address . And I'm going to continue to explore what options we have for doing that in the City. That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I do. Can you hear me? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. MCANDREW : Great. Okay, so last year a concern was brought to me by a resident (inaudible ) all right. Are you still there? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. MCANDREW : So over the past weekend even today I was receiving time-stamped pictures and texts that this power washer -- but it's not a DPW, all right? And like I said, this has been brought up to me again by concerned citizens . I'm being told that it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 being used by a DPW worker for private use. So and these picture s show the power washer on a trailer and attached to a personal vehicle at the residence of a DPW worker. So I'm also told that this piece of equipment has a usage counter . And I was told that this piece of equipment has never been used by DPW, just the other single tank power washer. So with all of this said, you know, last year I didn't accuse anybody . But I looked into it. That's part of my role as a Councilman is to check out and look into concerns by taxpayer s. So I'm doing the same this year. I'm not accusing anybody of anything . I don't know. You know, this person could own it or not. But it's just -- with that said, I want to make a motion. The reason I'm making a motion is because this is a reoccurrence . So my motion is, I would like to make a motion to have the administration conduct an investigation into this matter so we can have definitive answers . MR. DONAHUE : All right. There's a motion on the floor made by Mr. McAndrew . Is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question -- MR. MCANDREW : On the question , excuse me, I'm sorry. On the question , I mean, I have all of these picture s. I have all of this backup information . I will send it to help, you know, with administration to conduct this investigation . And it's -- let's just clear it up. Let's finally find out what's going on here. MR. DONAHUE : Just to clarify on the question too, we're just asking -- we're requesting that they conduct an investigation ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. MR. MCANDREW : On behalf of the residents . MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. No, no, I just wanted to clarify that we're requesting . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MR. DONAHUE : We can't technically force them to do anything .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 MR. MCANDREW : No, I'm requesting . I'm asking, requesting . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. And then secondly , so this is due to the horrific crimes over the past couple weeks in the City. Everybody knows about it. Everybody 's talking about it. I'm afraid for my daughters and grandchildren . I'm afraid for all of your children and grandchildren of you guys on Council and our residents . So gangs are here. I remember a couple years ago, maybe 10 or 15 years ago there was a lot of activity or so-called gang activity . And we were told by, you know, these are just wannabe gang members . There were a couple of knuckleheads in the neighborhoods . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 But that no longer exists. This is real gang activity . So with that said, I know that there was an article in the paper -- a podcast conduct ed by the Times with Chief Carroll , which I'll be honest with you I didn't get to see it yet. And I know that most residents probably don't have the ability to do that, you know, because it's a link in the Times and if they don't go online and read the Times. So with that said and because of, you know, the increase in crime I would -- Mr. Voldenberg , if you could request Chief Carroll and the Mayor to come into us, provide us with, you know, statistics -- updated crime statistics within the City. And, you know, he could talk to the podcast that he already did. But I'd like to see a strategy from both of them because of increase in gang activity and what moving forward , what we're going to do about it to provide a safe city for all of us. Would you do that, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll reach out to both, Mr. McAndrew . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And also, Mr. Voldenberg , while I have you here, I've been asking about Rubicon data for three or four weeks now. It's a simple request . I know that technically we don't have a Rubicon person on staff. But this information should be collected or this data should be collected because it's used to reroute trucks and it's supposed to provide us all these savings. Please reach out again. Maybe they didn't get the message . But I still want to know where these savings have been had with this system. And, please reach out again. What else can I say? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up again, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And that's all I have right now. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I got nothing at this time. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
