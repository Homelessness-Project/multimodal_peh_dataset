If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . What is the update on the union contract negotiations ? MR. DONAHUE : Negotiations are still 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 ongoing . MS. HODOWANITZ : I saw the Controller 's report for the month of May and noted that there have been no payments to Ufberg and Associates even though they have had meetings in April, May, and June. So that expense continue s to accrue. That will be interesting to see what they get since they've already racked up $171,601.07. Let's see the 2021 audit, is that progressing well? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. We have to ask for an update on the June 20th deadline that they gave us. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, I remember last week you said that they are projecting a September 30th completion date. We'll see if they make it this year. MR. DONAHUE : They gave us a list of two with separate items. One they needed by June 20th and one they needed by August 1st to achieve that date. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, I'd love to see the engagement letter. There should be some kind of penalty if they miss the completion date. If during Fifth Order I will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 be interested to hear if we have any answers to the letters sent the in by Lazor and McGovern with regard to the Payroll Preparation Tax. They raise some very interesting questions . And we're headlong into that new process , aren't we? So I think we ought to have some answers to that about what we're doing with the self-employed and rental income and that should be coming pretty quickly . One thing I was thinking about all day today, I looked at the October , 2021 Act 47 coordinator 's recommendations when we were coming out of distressed status. Jerry Cross recommended we come out in January . He was project ing a small operational deficit in 2023 followed by increasing operational deficits in '24, '25, and '26 because as he saw it, expenses were going to exceed revenues . Now, when he wrote this document in late 2021, he didn't know about 8.6 percent inflation . He didn't know that we would not have negotiated contracts for our three largest unions. He didn't know about the war in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Ukraine . And he didn't know that the county would have approve d reassessment. So I think that as we approach the budget process for 2023 and if we ever get someone hired to help us navigate out of distressed status -- I understand we're still waiting on our grant to be approved . I would love to see a public caucus with the administration down here and having them comment and how these issues are going to factor into the 2023 operational budget. I think that expenses are going to far exceed revenues next year. Just take the union contracts , the unions if they get more in terms of a pay raise than what's anticipated that's a legacy cost that goes forward forever . And then you're going to have inflation affecting utilities , other contracts , a whole lot of things. So I would like to see some really hard realistic projections of expenses for next year because it's not so easy just to raise taxes or let's take out a 30-year bond. We need to do some hard thinking we're in tough economic times.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 And just because we came out of distressed status, doesn't mean that we aren't on the thin edge and could slide back in. That's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is John Thomas. MR. THOMAS: Good evening, Council . My name is John Thomas. I'm 75 years old, a lifelong city resident . I'm current ly living at Geneva House on Adams Avenue. And I don't know if anybody is familiar with a bar called Levels on Linden Street. They play music. I live in the back of the building . Their music is basically in the back of their building . I'm only a few feet away from them. They play music from 2:00 in the afternoon until 3 and 4 in the morning almost nonstop . Occasionally they might start at 5 or 6:00 in the evening until 3 or 4 or 5 in the morning , sometimes later six days a week. Now, I love music. But is there something that could be done that they could stop playing music at 11:00 at night? They have several hours to play in. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. DONAHUE : There are City ordinances . Have you ever called and -- either the police department or licensing and inspection to complain ? MR. THOMAS: Mr. Donahue , if you -- MR. DONAHUE : I'm just asking -- MR. THOMAS: Pardon? MR. DONAHUE : I'm just asking if you've ever called to -- MR. THOMAS: I forgot to mention this. I called the police department Saturday night at 7:30 in the evening . They sent an officer up. They paid no attention to it. They just kept playing it until 3 or 4 in the morning . MR. DONAHUE : So at 7:30 at night I believe the City ordinance is allowed that. MR. THOMAS: That's when I called the officer and he went up and -- MR. DONAHUE : If I'm not mistaken , I believe the City ordinance says after 10 for sound. During the week and 11 on the weekends . MR. THOMAS: 10:30, 11 is the ordinance . MR. DONAHUE : It's 10 during the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 week and 11 on weekends . MR. THOMAS: I wish somebody could help me out because 3, 4 in the morning , that's a lot to take. MR. DONAHUE : We'll have our City Clerk send something over. If you want to leave contact information we'll send you along what we get back. MR. THOMAS: Thank you very much. Have a good evening . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Please leave your contact the information with Alison there and we'll get back to you what we hear back. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Next on the list is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner, taxpayer . 7-D, I'm against that resolution to hire Nossaman , LLP, $4,000 a month for over two years to help lobby for federal infrastructure and other funding . Can't that be done by somebody in the City? Why do we have to pay people to do work that somebody in the City should be doing? That's how we got into trouble in the Doherty 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 administration . They hired people that we didn't -- we didn't even need, consultant s after consultant s. This is the same thing. Why can't the Mayor do this or the BA? Somebody should be able to do this instead of throwing out money. Like Joan was saying, we just got out of -- I don't know. It's ridiculous . Anyway, I think you should vote against that. Next thing, it's coming up on the end of June and I have yet to see a street sweeper in Tripp Park. Usually it's April, latest May. And so far it's well at the end of June, I have yet to see one at least on the blocks around where I live anyway. I haven't seen one ever. Next thing, I neglect ed to bring this up last week. It was back in the fall I was promised I would have our corner fixed, all the curbs and -- by the supervisor . And now like I said, it's we're almost at the end of June and I have yet to see anybody up there. So I'm hoping -- it's the corner of Bulwer and North Rebecca . I'm hope they get up there soon 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 before the cold weather starts. I want to talk about the DPW. Years ago I used to have coal heat so I needed ash cans to get my ashes out. I got rid of the coal heat years ago. But still had my ash cans, which I use for yard work to throw in grass clippings and bushes I trim. Last couple weeks I lost two ash cans. The garbage men are taking them. They're old and some of them had a hole in them. But I think the City owes me two ash cans. They shouldn 't have taken those cans. They should have just -- oh, and this is a new crew. I've used those ash cans for years for the same reason. And they never disappeared . Now, we got a new crew, the two other guys went to other jobs in the City. And my two ash cans disappeared . I think they owe me two containers . Lastly, last week I talked about Boozy B's. I went there Friday the first day and I thought it was awesome . They had a really good crowd. And I was there about 8:30 Friday night. And it was really busy. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 wished them well. It was really, really good. I never had anything like that before. It was really, really good. And I advise everybody to go and at least try it. I'm giving them a nice plug here. And you can take it out. They just have to put a lid on it. So people can take it out if you want to. But I eat mine there. They have a black wall. And they have markers . You could write something on the wall. I was really impressed by it. So I hope they do well. We need small businesses like that to make it in the City. And I will be there again, probably pretty often. I really liked it. Thank you for your time. That's all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Someone signed the sign-in sheet next and I can't make out what the name is before Mr. Raines? There's an L there. MR. MCANDREW : I think that's you. MR. MORGAN: I scribble . Good evening , Council . The first thing I have here today I think is pretty important in regard to the residents in the City considering what took 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 place in Texas with the loss of those children . And I think the City of Scranton really needs to rethink security for the public school system. Only I think it needs to not send the Scranton Police Officers into the Scranton School District . I think the Scranton School District needs to create its own security force of veterans , combat veterans as a matter of fact who are willing to use the weapons they have to protect the children in this district . Hopefully that will never happen in Scranton . But I'm sure that the people in Texas thought they would never have the problem they have either. And as they researched this, they find out that they had the ballistic shield three minutes after the whole thing started and that the children were basically executed in that school as the police officers stood outside and waited. And I just think that it's one thing to be a policeman . And I respect policemen . But I think that sometimes we're all born with something that wants us not to do harm to other people, and sometimes there isn't time to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 hesitate . So you need somebody who is actually experienced trying to actually do harm to people, people who have been in combat who won't think twice about doing what has to be done to protect those children in that school district . And it might sound like a very silly thing to say at a Council meeting , but maybe someone should ask somebody how they feel if they've lost one of their children and the affect that has on them not just for today but for the rest of their life. And not only that, I don't know how that community is ever going to bounce back because they've just taken such a hit it's beyond belief. And I'm not blaming the police because I don't think they were ever prepared to really go in there because I think policing and taking on an active shooter are two different things, especially with the way that whole thing went down. And other thing I have here today is, you know, I hope -- well, first I'll start by saying I'm going to give you my phone number. It's 570-558-1648.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 And a couple people have responded to, you know, working together to put the home rule charter on the ballot. But it just doesn't have to do with Scranton 's Home Rule Charter . It has to do also with the county because both of them have to go together , not just the City. Now, I really think it's time for Scranton and the surrounding community to realize one thing that I believe to be true. But, of course, a group would have to come together and agree that this was the way to proceed . I think the Scranton Police Department , I think the Scranton Fire Department should be cast in a new role as a regional fire department and a regional police force because I think that Scranton has trained professional s that could help to create a countywide police and fire department to work for all of the communities located in Lackawanna County because there is a lot of people and a lot of communities that have no police protection and no fire protection . And the cost of that could be spread across the whole county and make it affordable . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 And I also believe that Scranton needs help in the cost in regards to its pension plans. It's just something -- fire and police protection is very expensive . And it's something that everyone needs, not just the people in Scranton but everybody in the whole county. And if we can't bring our elected officials together to regional ize law enforcement and fire protection , then the residents themselves have to sit down and find a way to write a charter to make it happen because I just think as a citizen of the county and really of the country , everybody deserves those protections . And hopefully somebody will call, you know, 570-558-1648. I'd really like young people to get involved because I'm 63. And most of the people are old. And I just think we have to build continuity for a future of this community . And I think the young people hold the key moving forward . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list Derek Raines. MR. RAINES: I want to start my clock on here so I don't do like I did last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 time and just keep rambling , which I do apologize for that last time. Derek Raines, 919 Monroe Avenue. And this wasn't something I planned to talk about. But what the gentleman just talked about, I grew up in Indianapolis , which is now one of the best cities in the United States. And what they did was, they took the whole -- all of these counties and Marion County became Indianapolis . They got rid of all of these little cities, all of that waste and everything . And it became one of the best cities in the United States. And I don't understand why we can't do that here. I'm here today though to talk about, first off, last -- two weeks ago when I was here we had horrible , horrible rain here. My wife and I were here. We were leaving and the Police or the Fire Department , they saw my wife and I trying to get into the van. And the fireman came out and helped us be able to get into the van, which was just wonderful which brings up the next thing. Does anybody here know how many handicap parking spots are available for this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 building of this size? Zero. There is one on the street, not one ADA compliant parking spot in this whole area. And that is, number one, it's against the law. And there is no reason why this City cannot say, oh, we're going to put in ADA parking spaces because it's the right thing to do. We're talking about walking and doing all of this kind of stuff. How about just take care of the basic stuff. Make our City handicap accessible . Back to the fire department helping us out, a couple of days later I had an issue with the police department somewhere I'm not really that familiar with believe it or not. So we went to the police station -- my first time to in the big police station . I'm in my handicap chair. We pull up. My wife pushes the button. The van, the thing pops out. I get on the beautiful sidewalk . I ride in. And I go up to the front door and I push the button and the door opens up. I go inside and the lady says, oh, can I help you? And I told her I'm having an issue with my handicap license plate. And she says, oh, hold 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 on a minute. I'll have a policeman help you. Five minutes, a policeman is there helping me, signed it. We went right out the door. And what really mystified me the most if any of you have not been in the police station , the new one I think on South Washington , that is a 100 percent handicap compliant building . And all of these other things that the City has, the City should truly be ashamed of because it doesn't meet the American s With Disabilities Act. And it's -- we're talking about doing walking and everything else that we want to do. Why don't we just try to make our City handicap accessible . Because if you're handicapped accessible , then it's accessible to everybody . And it's just a wonderful thing for me to go to that police station . And my streets , a couple weeks ago when I complained about our streets , they still have not been swept. I rode down to my favorite restaurant of Zuppa Del Giorno, 10 minute ride, came back home. Took my $37,000 wheelchair up on my porch and I raise it up. And you would not believe the gravel and the rocks that fell out of my wheelchair. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Isn't that hard for a city our size to have our streets swept. It's not like it's something that is brand new. And the handicap parking , again, by law you're required -- the closest parking spot into this building is required to be handicap accessible . And it is required for every so many parking spots, you are require d to have van accessible . My van is handicap accessible . My wife and I had to park in the middle of the road to be able to open up the van. And I think it's a disgrace for the City of Scranton this size not to have these products taken care of. There it is. Thank you so much. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Raines. MR. RAINES: I hope I did better on my time today. Thank you so much. MR. DONAHUE : You did. Thank you. Next on the list is Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn . And on the handicap issue, there is a parking space designate d for handicap . People don't always seem to respect it. But it should be kept open. It's on the rear of the building . And there's a power door and a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 ramp. I don't know about the steepness of the ramp. I'm not sure there. But that end parking spot is handicap accessible . And actually you could be ticketed in Pennsylvania . On the Sunday paper we had an interview of our Mayor. And I have stated that I'm not unhappy with our Mayor by and large. However , with the idea of attracting people from out of town, we have to resolve this property tax issue with institutional property tax abatements especially . But my sister and brother -in-law moved up to Long Pond area by the race track. And they built a really nice home. And that was in about 1996 or around there. And their property tax was $1,750 a year. That's pretty reasonable for a new house, especially in a really nice development . Well, when everybody came storming in, the property tax went up to $6,000 a year. And then because of new schools being built and everything to accommodate all of these people, then 2007 on December , we had the stock market crash started . Well, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 neighborhood moved out. They were offered in 2005 I think it was $450,000 for the house. And it cost them less than 200,000 to build it. And by that time, they probably moved five years ago to Florida . They were finally given about a little over $200,000 for the house. So we just have to be careful . These people have to be planned for. And we don't really need somebody coming from out of town and getting a big tax spending spree for their sake and misplacing a lot of other people. But hopefully , that will resolve itself. And I probably won't be around to see it anyway. Okay. You know, when you get older you get a little absentminded. And last week I forgot to mention the Congressional hearing s on television . And we're not an island. I appreciate you talking about it here. It's not a city issue. It's an everywhere issue. And today they had people that were election officials and Speaker of the House in Arizona had his face painted on a side of a panel van as a pedophile because he refused to go along with the big lie. And it's all -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 another home was invaded. The grandmother of the lady in Georgia that was an election official . People are being harassed . People are being threaten ed with guns. That's where my second amendment ideas end. I don't think you should be running around threatening people with guns. And I certainly hope that these people are offered some witness protection or something . And currently we have a Governor candidate that's basically a QAnon support er. So, you know, if you're a Republican , please consider voting Democrat . Thank you. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhaust s the sign-in sheet this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. LITTLE: Hi. My name is Rick Little. I live at 420 Adams High Rise down the street, Scranton , Pennsylvania . I spoke here before about them confiscating my stuff about three years ago. It's still confiscated . I had all kinds of meeting s with all kinds of people, social workers , lawyers , and the district attorney who is the attorney for my building but nobody to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 talk to in my building . I guess it all stems from my income being garnished from another state -- New York state to where I'm living on like $550 a month. And I go in to recertify in like August of 2019. And I questioned them raising my rent like $6 at that time. But I was too busy in Kings County, New York Family Court. My daughter was turning 18 where I found out that there is no appeal of anything after that. That's your life. I haven't seen my child since she was eight. And I got no help from my building because they changed the rules on service . And the building management is just opening up the door letting in the Lackawanna County Sheriff who sort of moonlight s as process servers. It's wasn't like a murder warrant or anything . It was like somebody 's lawyer's motion from Kings County. And it really cost my whole relationship with my child. And I'm in this thing with my building . I went in to recertify . So I was too busy to argue with it then. But then they confiscated my storage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 space, broke the lock, took it all out, abusively put it in another room, locked that room and made up a bunch of rules, which is what they do about everything , major, major policy changes . And so I'm writing letters . I'm writing letters . I couldn't get any cooperation from the cashier clerk or the manager. I go to the executive director and he puts me off like make an appointment with my secretary , which I tried to do five times. And finally I just had to write a letter putting it on paper because there is no grievance thing. I mean, I was just asking could I have a copy of my lease, all of these things that are in my lease. And this is one of the biggest problems . In my lease it says I am -- I should get the amenities of the local county state and I don't. I called the police when they burglarized my storage space. And they say, you know, see the manager , which I did going up the chain. And then I wrote a letter to the executive director . He ignored it for a couple months. And I wrote a letter to the guy above 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 him, Gary Pecilucci {phonetic }. And that was January 12th, 2020. I waited three months for a response from that. And then I withheld rent and then COVID came. And then years passed. And then I got slammed with a lawsuit . And I'm finding that everybody in the county, everybody in the City is -- this includes , you know, the Police Department , the Fire Department , the Code Enforcement department , the Lackawanna Pro Bono, the Northeast Penn Legal, they're all on the same team with the landlord . I didn't even get to see my landlord in court. I see David Coyne, the District Attorney . And they hire Pat O'Malley the ex-commissioner in my building . It's crazy, crazy stuff. I need help with the Fire Department . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, sir. I think we have your contact information . I think we did reach out to them, right, Mr. Voldenberg ? I don't know if we received anything back yet. MR. VOLDENBERG : We did. I believe Mr. Schuster was involved also. We'll follow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 up. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, once we get something back we'll pass that along. I believe the last time you were here you left your contact information . MR. LITTLE: Like I said last time, it's been up with the Mayor's -- Chris Smith. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, sir. MR. LITTLE: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . First, because nobody did actually say it, I want to remind people that the walkability study is meeting . It's -- well, it's on the website . So anybody who wants to see it, can go. But there is a meeting . There's something before it. But the meeting itself starts at 7:00 next Monday on the 28th. And it will be over at the former Scranton Central High School in the auditorium there. I'm going to go because I'm anxious to see how friendly or unfriendly they are going to be to vehicles in downtown . Also, I would like to know are we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 going to have any walkability studies in any of the neighborhoods ? MR. DONAHUE : We're starting in downtown for right now. MS. SCHUMACHER : And is there a schedule ? MR. DONAHUE : So part of the study is connect ing them to -- is connecting walkability and interconnect ivity to all the neighborhoods but not necessarily in the neighbor hood -- MS. SCHUMACHER : -- within the neighborhoods themselves . I mean, I could walk down my block and I could have beautiful concrete sidewalks that I put in myself and some other people have as well. And then there's ones that are up, down. There's gravel. There's everything you could want on that block. And, I mean, I remember when I was in -- the five years I pushed my mother's wheelchair , you know, we were in and out. And the traffic comes a little fast sometimes and, you know, I think you need to look at the neighborhoods too as the -- is the thing. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 And then what, if any, is the impact on the union contracts -- the police union contract with the Police Chief on leave? MR. DONAHUE : The Police Chief isn't on leave. MS. SCHUMACHER : Not the Police Chief, I'm sorry, the police union president . MR. DONAHUE : I don't know. MS. SCHUMACHER : I mean -- MR. DONAHUE : That's a union issue. I am not familiar with what. MS. SCHUMACHER : But we're part of the contract . And it's very late as it is. MR. DONAHUE : But we're not involved with -- in how the union operates . The union operates they way they operate . MS. SCHUMACHER : But wouldn't it be nice to know if the union has agreed to continue negotiation s or if they are going to wait until the administration -- MR. DONAHUE : I know they have been continuing to negotiate . MS. SCHUMACHER : Even since they went on leave, okay. Well, that's -- MR. DONAHUE : I don't know if the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 person you're referring to has been a part of the negotiations . But I know that the negotiations with the Police Department have been ongoing. MS. SCHUMACHER : Continuing . Okay. Well, yeah, I thought automatically that it would be. Then quickly because I'm running out of time is Item 7-D. I do not think -- we already have representation . We've got a President . We've got two Senators . We've got a rep -- I think there's probably only one rep left. And I don't see any reason why we are interested in spending $4,000 a month for what we don't know. But if any of you really truly want to give this an approval , I would ask that you first amend it so that anything that is requested of this lobbyist would be done in writing and you people would be publishing that in Third Order because that's one of the things, the further you get away from this building the less transparency you have. And so I would ask that you, number one, that you vote against this. And but if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 you are going to go vote for it, please amend it to include that requirement that all the assignments come here or through here. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I also agree with that with not having a lobbyist . We're looking at $4,000 a month, which is $48,000 a year or roughly a little over $23 an hour for a 40-hour position full time for the entire year. I think that it's the City's responsibility and people are employed in the City to lobby for their own benefits and to go forward . I have no problem if the City wants to hire someone who is directly responsible to the public. Put it on a budget. Put it up in a position here that is responsible for doing that rather than subcontracting it out. When you subcontract out, you get into legal agreements between this company -- the lobbyist and this building . As soon as you get between legal issues in confidentiality as we've seen from other document s that have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 80 percent blacked out for anything related to communication , at that point the lobbyist becomes an independent entity with no ability for the public to oversee it because their direction will be at the direction of the City of Scranton 's legal department , which no one will have access to in the public to see what is going on because that will be considered confidential legal information . And that is abhorrent to the entire process . It's great that we want to get more money put in by possible lobbying . But contracting it out and taking -- stripping away responsibility by being able to hide it behind a legal shield compromises the entire process . I also looked at the property assessment . It's kind of interesting that every time property assessments come up, it is almost always concurrent with the market running into a housing bubble that all of a sudden cities and communities want to go out at the very top of marketability , low interest rates in a bubble to baseline the worth of a house based on hyperinflated rates and artificial standards , not taking a look at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 average , but they want to take a look at the peak of what the house was worth even after market collapses , even after we're now at 6, 7 percent interest rate that we're looking at. House values aren't worth what they were worth two years ago, even a year ago. This isn't going to be reflect ed in the assessment because they won't have that information available . So it concerns me that we look for reassessments at the height of profitability not an actual value for what it was for the community . And last, I know you've had executive meeting s on personnel matters and that there have been police out on administrative leave. I would be interested to know how many officer s are out on administrative leave and what are the officers out on administrative leave for. I'm not asking for names. I'm not asking for who did what. I'm just asking for a breakdown of how many officers out of the department are on leave and what they are on leave for. That is not sensitive information . And that should not be shielded . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 We should know if there is an administrative issue with our police department , whether it's use of force issues, whether it's -- in Florida there was a volunteer officer who worked with the police department who was selling drugs out of his own police vehicle . This should not be hidden. And I understand there is confidentiality for personnel through the contracts . But that should not bar giving a number of how many are out on administrative leaves and why they are out on administrative leave. That's all that I ask. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. GUZIEWICZ : My name is Delmar Guziewicz . Currently I live in Wilkes-Barre. I work here and I -- MR. DONAHUE : I'm sorry, if you are not a resident of the City, you can't speak at City Council . MR. GUZIEWICZ : This is regarding City matters , however . Is that relevant ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. DONAHUE : I'm sorry, it's part of our rules and we just need to stay consistent with our rules. MR. GUZIEWICZ : All right. I did speak to the Mayor last Tuesday , and she did asked me to come speak here at the meeting regarding this. MR. DONAHUE : If you want to write us a note on what you want to speak to and if you want to leave your information with Alison, we'll reach out to you. But we just need to stay consistent with the rules. MR. GUZIEWICZ : Understood . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: No, just what we talked about in caucus earlier about the issues with DPW. I think most people experienced late pickup or no pickup with their garbage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 recently . And that's a serious concern . I spoke so Larry West, the BA who's been the acting director down there and spoke to him for a long time on Friday. And I think there's a number of issues going on everywhere from, you know, Rubicon. It sounds like they were are transferring over to this Rubicon system. Maybe they were short a truck or they weren't running a truck. And, you know, maybe some conflicts between management and the actual DPW workers , but I believe that they're working things out at this time. Right now I think that they're -- from what I'm told, they're a half a day behind at this stage. And I'm hoping to make that up in the next day or two. But I just hope that they could resolve whatever the issues are down there so that citizens can get their garbage picked up and picked up on time. That's a public health and safety issue. So hopefully they could arrive at a resolution and get this resolved for all the City of Scranton . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MS. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I have two comments . So one, I did get a call from a resident regarding a property . Mr. Voldenberg , the property is at 119 North Cameron Avenue. There's a lot of overgrown grass and other issues if we can send that over to Code Enforcement . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MS. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And the other thing is, last week I did ask -- I added some questions to Mr. McAndrew 's correspondence on Rubicon . The two questions I asked was, does DPW use the Rubicon system daily and can we get an update on how much money has been saved currently with the use of the system. So I know we haven't gotten an answer yet, but if we could send another correspondence over to see if we can get those answers . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. MS. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. First 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 off, thank you to Miss Schumacher for the reminder about the walkability study. I was planning on mention ing that in my Fifth Order comment s because I forgotten during the announcement . But for all of those who might not have heard, but just as a reminder, this coming Monday, the 27th, from 7:00 to 8:30 over at Lackawanna College and the People's Security Bank Theater , that's on 501 Vine Street, there will a speech from Jeff Speck about the walkability study, which I don't believe I am able to make. But I wish that I could because we can gain some important information and some information sharing from the resident s at this meeting . But anyone who is able to go, I would encourage you to do so and I look forward to hearing about it. A few of the other things that I wanted to bring up that I had also mentioned during caucus, first regarding the Scranton Fire Department , we had sent correspondence to them a few weeks ago asking about firefighter s being sent out to other departments outside of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 the City. And I don't believe we've received a response . So I would like to ask Mr. Voldenberg to once again send correspondence , another reminder asking for those previous question s and the details about the policy on that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up with the Chief tomorrow morning . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And I just want to speak real quick to what Mr. Raines brought about handicap accessibility in our city. It is a complaint that I've heard before so not just being focused on walkability , the people who are able to walk through the City but for people who do use wheelchairs . I do find that important . And I would like to start conversations with the administration about how we could approach that and what we could do as a City to be more friendly towards the wheelchair users or the disabled community because that's certainly an area for improvement . And I agree we should have a van accessible spot near City Hall. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 I would love to see that happen. So I'm interested in trying to work on that. It's not something that would happen overnight . I'm sure there are a number of changes that we need to make or perhaps a study on how we could become more accessible in that way. But I'm interested in that for sure. And I also wanted to bring up the Land Bank owned properties in the City. We seem to have an agreement with the county Land Bank that our DPW would take care of and maintain those properties -- the empty vacant lots that we have around the City. Those are not all Land Bank owned. But the ones that are, have not been maintained . And I would like to send correspondence to DPW to ask about a maintenance and a monitoring schedule because it shouldn 't be that we need to harass them and send multiple e-mails and calls in order to get these properties taken care of. I do understand they have a lot of other things on their plate and what they take care of around the city. But this is an agreement that we have and I would like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 figure out how we could get better in maintaining those. There's quite a few that I have a concern about that I received multiple complaints on. One of the worst seems to be on Harrison Avenue, I believe it's 525 or 527 Harrison Avenue. That's an empty lot. The weeds and the grass are taller than I am. And I'm 5'3. So that's just shameful that we let that get to that point. And actually there was a neighbor who told me they attempted to bring their mower there to mow it down, but they couldn't because of all the trash that was also there. So this is on Harrison Avenue where people frequently walk up and down. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could please send that correspondence . And lastly, the other thing I wanted to mention was about Scranton Tomorrow. I would like to know when they plan on coming in for a caucus. And I'm hopeful that it would be before our August recess. I know many people have been looking forward to an update from them as well as information about the Pocket Park. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a few. So the first complaint I got -- and, Mr. Voldenberg , I forwarded you the e-mail and there was picture s in a separate e-mail. This is the old Scranton School for the Deaf. The property is in disarray with multiple blight issues. It's on the corner of North Washington and Electric Street. So please send correspondence to Code Enforcement for that one. MR. VOLDENBERG : That was sent out this afternoon . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. But I -- the person that e-mailed, I said I would bring it up. So I just want to go on the record as bringing it up. Also, I had a couple concerns and questions regarding CDBG grants and their criteria . So I'm familiar with the LSA. I'm kind of familiar with the CDBG grants, you know, they're from HUD and they're federal . But a couple people asked me they said, you know what, we're not familiar with the criteria . And they asked. I said sure I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 ask. If you could reach out to Mrs. Cipriani and see if their team can put together like, say, like an information sheet on CDBG frequently asked question s or 101 when it comes to seeking them and the criteria thereof . And if they could, you know, put it on the website somewhere so it's visible . I don't think that's a big request so I said sure. And then also, everybody talked about garbage this week. I don't know a sole in Scranton that didn't have a problem with garbage . So last week I asked please bring Rubicon in, all right, or the principals , first of all, for an update because , you know, we were told last year they were saving us a million dollars . Well, it's six months. I would love to see how much money we've saved with the system I wasn't in favor for just so you know. So my understanding is, you know, we got some correspondence from the DPW -- I don't want to say management -- well, supervisors because the head is still, you know, is out on leave. But, you know, the information we got was, oh, there's a truck down. No, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 truck wasn't down. It wasn't being repaired. It was pulled by management . So when you pull a truck that you're used to running , I mean, this is common sense, you're going to get behind on garbage pickup. Why it was done, beyond me. Doesn't make sense, right? And supposedly they're following the system, they got to follow the system which is the Rubicon system. So that apparently isn't working either. I haven't seen garbage left behind like this in 40 years. I've never seen an issue like this before, especially for a week. And I got calls from people that two weeks in a row their garbage was picked up five days late. It's inexcusable . You know, some people complain about the $300 garbage fee. I don't mind it, because you know what, they come. They pick up my garbage and pretty much anything I put out as long as it's done neatly. But to have garbage left behind because of leadership and management for almost two weeks is just unacceptable . So we never got a response about when Rubicon is coming in, did we, Mr. Voldenberg ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Please send it again. We're not going away. So I definitely want them in here. I don't think we even need to ask administration for them to come in. Why don't we just reach out to them ourselves? Can we do that? We gave administration the courtesy to have them come in. But if they're not going to respond , I recommend just contacting them independently to have them come in. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up with Mr. West. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. That's perfect . Also, the traffic study I requested two weeks ago, another traffic study with a 30-degree angle, did we get anything back on that on St. Ann's Street -- the parking ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Well, circle around for that one. And then what else do I have here? Mr. Spindler , you know, I did hear him before talk about not having his streets cleaned and that was probably in March. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 And then Mr. Raines just had the same issue. So can you please reach out to the administration or the appropriate department and ask them, you know, when are the streets getting swept? Have they been? Were some missed? All right? Follow up on them two streets and see if there's a schedule that we're not aware of. And then also Mr. Raines' concern s about handicap accessible parking out front. I realize there's one in the back, not everybody realize s it. But you know what, I think his concerns are valid. We're not -- if we're not in compliance out front, let's fix it. I know it's a long process but what normally happens is we'll have committee s and we'll have -- and it takes a longer period of time. I think just right now creating one spot in front of the building can be done as soon as possible without much work or conversation , I should say. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just quickly , Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to the auditor s to see if they received the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 information they requested by yesterday 's due date and the correspondence from last week? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : And also, just check with the administration on a timeline . I know you talked to them a couple weeks ago and said they were working on it. But what's the timeline for putting the audit out for bid moving forward because this is the last year that the current company is under contract . And that's all I have for this evening. I know, Mr. King, you had something to add. MR. KING: Yeah, I forgot earlier . I appreciate it. A citizen reached out to me about 1302 Blucher Avenue. The yard seems to be completely overgrown. I just rode by it tonight and it is. It doesn't look like it's been mowed in quite some time. So if you could just maybe contact the LIPS Department or someone and also, the drainage or rain gutters -- not rain gutters -- the gutters that would come down Cherry Street at the corner there of I think 1325 Blucher and Cherry Street, that corner. It's kind of like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 a dead end. So just if DPW, if they could address like they're filled with leaves and debris. So it's kind of a drainage issue. I would appreciate that. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll address both, Mr. King. MR. KING: Appreciate that. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , you had something else. MR. SCHUSTER : So to tie this all up, in the past I made request of DPW to see if they had a maintenance schedule for drainage basins, especially in East Mountain , West Mountain . To bring Dr. Rothchild and Mr. McAndrew 's request all together , when we send that request can we see if we have a schedule or maintenance and monitoring for the Land Bank properties for the drainage basins in the City? And then for the street sweepers, I know that the street sweepers , I know that the street sweepers are suppose d to run on a schedule that coincide s with the garbage pickup schedule but to see if we have maintenance and monitoring for all of those different services 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 and if we're following the street sweeper schedule that coincide s with the garbage schedule . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MS. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING AN ORDINANCE ENTITLED “APPROVING THE INTER-MUNICIPAL TRANSFER OF A RESTAURANT LIQUOR LICENSE R-15376, CURRENTLY OWNED BY THE ESTATE OF GEORGE CHERKAN , WANDA C.

MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MS. SCHUSTER : Second. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF THE GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY FOR UP TO $7,200,132.16 TO BE USED TOWARDS THE KEYSER AVENUE STORMWATER AND PUMP STATION . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 MS. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'm glad to see that 5-C has been introduced tonight . It's been something that I think has been on the back burner for quite some time. I think FEMA has been waiting for this. So it's good to see that this is -- we're starting the process . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? I'm also happy to see this on. I know a couple years ago this goes into, you know, we did the engineering study and then -- which allows us then to apply for grants. And to also tie it into 7-D, when we apply for these grants I want the City to be on the same level playing field in terms of being awarded these grants. These are very competitive grants. And unless we have someone monitor ing every step of the way, you know, the likelihood of being awarded these grants goes down significantly . Anyone else on the question ?

MR. DONAHUE : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-D. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I've been talking about this for three weeks -- three or four weeks. I do not see the need for a lobbyist . Like I stated the past couple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 weeks, we have a Congress man in our backyard . We have U.S. Senators in our backyard . We have another Senator in our backyard . With adequate staff they could do this job that they are elected to do. We have people in-house that could do this. You can't go on Facebook any day of the week without seeing one of our Senators or one of our reps or one of our Congress men awarding money or finding money for different parts of the region. Why can't they do it for us now and kick it up a little bit? All right, so for them same reasons, that money could be spent somewhere else besides paying an advocate -- a retired legislature . It's good gig if you could get it like I said with the other position . But I'll be voting no and they are my reasons . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. KING: I would just like to say ideally that would be great if our Senators , our Congress men and their staffs can really focus and deliver this. But it's my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 understanding from everybody that I've talked to that we really need somebody in there fighting for us because this is competitive money across the country . There are cities fighting for this funding . And I think if we -- $44,000, if we could bring in millions to benefit the City, I think it's small price to pay. So I'll be voting yes. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I wanted to reiterate my stance on this piece of legislation and just provide my reasoning . So I believe that we need a person who is going to be in DC to do this work. We can't hire someone here and have them -- be paying for travel expenses for them to go back and forth to DC, I don't think that is manageable . I think it would be much more than the cost of this contract . And it's commonplace to contract out lobbyist s. We need someone who is going to be down there fighting for us for the funds for our city. Congress men and Senators , they have very large districts or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 the whole state to worry about. Even if they are from Scranton , we're still in competition with Wilkes-Barre or other neighboring cities and towns that are going to be looking for this infrastructure money. This is perhaps once in a lifetime with this bill and the amount of money that they are putting towards infrastructure . And I strongly believe that we need someone that is going to get as much of those funds as they can for our city because we're desperately in need of infrastructures changes here and across the country which is why they passed the bill. But that's why I'll be voting for this position . Also, in the backup in the contract it does state that they will be providing regular reports to Council I believe quarterly . So I look forward to receiving those reports and updates on the lobbying activities . And I'm happy to have them in for caucus and for them to be transparent about their work. And I'm hopeful that it will result in funding for the City. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 question ? MR. MCANDREW : I just want to say one more thing. So another thing about the 4,000 a month, I don't see anybody going to be hanging out Monday through Friday in Washington , DC with related expense s keeping it under $4,000 a month. I see hidden costs. I don't know anybody that could live on that, a thousand dollars and be in Washington Monday through Friday. I just have a problem with it. I just think we're going to be hit with some costs and it's not going to produce what we're being sold. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MS. SCHUSTER : I made my feelings known over the last couple weeks. I won't repeat it tonight but I'll also be voting no for 7-D. MR. DONAHUE : Just the contract is capped at four grand a month. No more can be spent -- no more than that can be spent. And you got to think, we're talking about 6.5 give or take trillion dollar federal budget. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 you got cities from all across the country competing for this money. Just the infrastructure money alone would make it worth it. But realistically , if you look at either -- what is it, 5-C or 5-D, if we would just get one of those grants, the $48,000 a year makes it well worth it, not even to mention the fact that we're talking about trying to get funding for a train from New York to Scranton . And there's about 30 different municipalities , authorities , counties just in Pennsylvania that have to be coordinated in terms of the grant funding they are putting in for that on top of another 30 to 40 municipalities in New Jersey that need to be coordinate d with that as well. So I think this is well worth it and I will be in full support of it. MR. DONAHUE : Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS.
