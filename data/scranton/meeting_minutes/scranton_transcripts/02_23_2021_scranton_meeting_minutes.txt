MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community , especially former City Councilwoman Mary Walsh Dempsey 's father, Thomas Walsh who passed away on Friday. We must also take a somber moment of silence tonight to mark the passing of over 500,000 people in the United States from the COVID-19 pandemic . Over 400 of our own here in Lackawanna County have tragically had their life taken too soon from this virus. Let us remember not to become numb to this extraordinary loss of life. It's easy to forget that within that death toll that we see on television or read in the newspaper every single day that it represents someone 's father, mother, grandfather , grandmother , son, daughter . Please pray for the families that have been shattered because of this virus and continue to have faith and hope that better 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 days are ahead.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals , Patricia Nestor and Fay Franus. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Patricia Nestor as follows : If the housing in Scranton is so affordable as you all claim, why is Weston Field turned into a homeless shelter ? Hasn't anyone told them? MS. REED: The second submission as submitted by Fay Franus as follows : Council . Last Tuesday February 16 2021 I emailed you my questions . Two very specific questions that I asked to be answered . Mr. Gaugahn deliberately did not answer. Why? Because he can and he always does. Tonight the citizens may hear more spin and side steps from Mr. Gaugahn . It is a shame we, the citizens have to wait yet another week to come back and address things Mr. Gaughan evades at the meetings before. It's a definite pattern .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 I shall give you an example . Mr. Gaughan when I asked weeks ago to try to help the people of Bellevue with the trucks he went on his lecture tour telling me council does not do this type of work and that you are there to pass legislation and not to enforce them. Only the city can do that. Then in his next breath he went on to say "Council has directed the police to enforce the signs on 3rd Avenue." Now I am paraphrasing there but I certainly can get Mr. Gaughan 's exact words. He was asking the police to help out. Which is good but he made it a point to let me know he can not do that. Check city council minutes of the meeting you can see Mr Gaugahgns exact words. I am fully aware of what council can and can not do but I also know they can also step in and help the city with these issues in Bellevue . If they so choose. Back to last week--- I asked why does council not allow citizens to zoom in live 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 to ask their questions and get their answers live during the meeting . I also asked What can council do to help the people make this possible ? I also said other meetings have citizens zoom into their meetings to address their comments and questions . To this response came my little lecture again. Mr Gaughan said Council likes getting emails and encourages everyone to write in and he gave out the e-mail and street address to write them in. He then when on to say we try to answer all the questions . Well at that that point I just thought what a smooth political statement . That was not true at all. Bill Gaughan did not answer my question at all. He completely kept jabbering about how people can write in and they have been doing this since the pandemic . I know all this --we all know this What I want to know is why can't we zoom into the meetings live to ask our questions . Not a peep out of Mr Gaughan about that. Why? Because council does not want us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 asking questions live because they would not want to have to answer them. What's more they do not want to have to be put on the spot. If I were at that meeting last week there is no way I would not have immediately said. "Mr. Gaughan you have not answered my question ." And guess what he either would have to or he would not. But he would be seen for what he is. This council has gotten away with so many shady replies . They know they can get away with it because we are not there to rebut them on the spot. So yes I would like an answer to that question . And since you get our emails before the meeting you certainly have time to re- read my questions from last week and you have time to figure out how to reply to this e-mail so you get the last word again. This cat and mouse game is very frustrating . All this coming back a week later to challenge you on your replies from the week before would never 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 need to happen if the citizens were able to zoom into the meeting live to ask our question . Then we would just click off. Is that actually asking too much? And no we do NOT want to wait until the summer or early fall. That's a cop out. Just answer my questions . When you have people speak at a caucus they get zoomed in very easily. So why can't we? Simple question . The other question you refused to answer was "Why is Scranton classified as a 2 A city? I did not believe there were enough people in Scranton to qualify as a 2 A city. I also said even after the census is completed Scranton still will not have enough people to be a A city. Even if you didn't know you could have offered to find out for me but Mr Gaugan said nothing ! When Janet Evans was president of city council never once did she give people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 lectures and tell them we are only here to legislate you have to call the city. Janet Evans Frank Joyce and Atty Boyd Hughes stayed at those meetings sometimes until 10 PM. Why? Because they made it a point to answer everyone 's questions and if they had to go to the administration to find things out they did. They never once asked a citizen to do a right to know request . They also never deliberately refused to answer anyone's questions hoping maybe it might not be brought up again. Mr. Gaugah I have never seen anyone as thing skinned as you. You can never be wrong. You can't handle being questioned about why you didn't do certain things--which are many by the way. So if by chance Mr. Gaughan you actually answer my questions I will be grateful . If you don't I will be right back here next week talking yet again about what you didn't answer this week. Don't you get tired of making excuses instead of speaking the truth? Try it some time you may find it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 refreshing . (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that is all the public comment for this evening . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Anyone on the question ? On the question , I'm not, you know, going to get in the back and forth with Miss Franus on some of the bizarre things that -- the manifest o that she wrote into us tonight . But I will say this, the question last week about the Class 2A city -- Scranton being a Class 2A city, I didn't gloss over that. I had to do a little bit of research on it. And I did send that to Miss Franus. There's a government handbook -- City Government in Pennsylvania handbook that I had sent her this afternoon . It's a long winded answer. I'm not going to go through every portion of it. But for those of you who are you interested , Scranton qualified for a second class city status all the way back in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 1900. The reason why we're still a Class 2A city is for a couple of different reasons . First of all, our population did drop significantly as everybody knows since the 1930s and 1940s. And we've been given several legislative reprieve s to keep our status a 2A city. It's only Scranton and the City of Pittsburgh . So in the document that I had sent to Miss Franus to answer her question that she had asked last week, one of the things it does point out and we all know that the special status that we have as a 2A city also allows special laws for Scranton . For example , the LST rate that we're able to enact for $156. That's a benefit of being a Class 2A city. And there's many other items as well. I believe a few years ago that Council woman Evans and previous Council that she was under did pursue changing the city status to the third class. But it's complicated . It's not as easy as just clicking your fingers and making that move because we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 may lose some of the benefit s of being a Class 2A city. So again, this is a lengthy document that I had sent to Miss Franus. So hopefully she takes some time to read that and hopefully that answers her question . As for the Zooming in live, I answered this last week but I'll answer it again. Council gives the public the opportunity to ask any and all questions . And I do my best personally to answer any and all questions . So if you ask me how far the earth is away from the moon I can't come up with that question off the top of my head. Some things require a little bit of research . And you have to look into things. You know, I don't claim to have all the answers to all the questions that are posed. We did try to have people call in live way back in the beginning of the pandemic and our meeting was hijacked . So there was some security concerns there. The way that we're doing it now works. People who want to ask questions ask them. Their comments are read into the record. The record is publically 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 available on the City's website . We are on YouTube and Channel 19 every single week for anyone who wants to know what's going on at a Council meeting . The legislation is available including all of the backup if anybody 's interested on anything that we're voting on. And if anybody has any relevant questions about the legislation , we certainly -- and I certainly entertain them every week. So that's number two. And finally , Marie Schumacher had a question about the number of people qualifying for the LERTA designation . And we did get that information that was six people from 2019. So there's an answer to that. Any other people on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have just something to report. I have been receiving a lot of questions and concerns about the garbage fee being bundled in with the taxes. And I mean, of course, we think -- it is a great idea. But the concerns and question s -- and I had a great conversation with City Treasurer , Mary Jo Sheridan last night and feel that I -- I posed some of them questions to her and concern s, one being -- here, I'll give you an example . So say you have an escrow account , okay, and most people do. My understanding is that, you know, it's not unique to this area having fees embedded in with the taxes, like the library tax or like Abington does, Jermyn does. But if there's some mortgage brokers outside the area, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 one resident came to me and said they're, like, what are we supposed to do with this? It's a fee. You know, we do it -- we do a tax analysis and spread everything out. We do a tax analysis in say September , October and that's when we spread everything out for 12 months. This is unique to us. So the concern from the resident is, like, can I still pay my garbage fee because maybe they're not going to pull it out or maybe they're not going to get it in in time. So I asked that question . I saw that we recently received an e-mail in the frequent ly asked questions on the website -- the City's website which is great. It doesn't address some of these concerns but it addresses a lot of them. Some other questions were can I, you know, do I pay the whole thing and just write one check and that answer is yes. Do -- are the taxes built into the City and the School District , yes, they are. What else did I ask? Here's what I was told by the Tax Office -- I mean, sorry, by the Treasurer that, you know, it's the responsibility of the resident to notify, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 know, their bank or their mortgage company that this is coming, okay, that they need to plan to, you know, that it's included in there. So they have to escrow. So they have to do that, pull out more than $300 a month, you know, $300 a year over 12 months. So, I mean, I did say, you know, maybe we should have put -- make an insert explaining that because resident s are concerned about this and they are confused . What else did they say? They have to understand the layout of it, all right, and it goes back to some of the stuff we just said. But I was told and reassured that the Treasurer 's Office is, you know, please call them. If they don't -- if you can't get through to them once, call them again. You can -- you can -- they're willing to help. They're there to help. They also, you know, they'll definitely get back to you. They'll work with you. And, you know, my understanding is the first year is going to be -- there's going to be some adjustments . Also, they also told 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 me that they've been working on and completed a lot of what we brought up last week the exoneration process for, you know, someone who owns a duplex, doesn't rent out the other side, that process is happening . People are getting exonerations which is good. So they need again, to communicate with the Treasurer 's Office. Another thing that was brought to me too was, in addition , I received numerous complaint s from constituents that the Single Tax Office is only allowing those paying cash to come inside the office and pay to get their receipt upon payment . Seniors in particular have complained about this because not being able to go inside because they want to pay by check. So they're only accepting cash. You know what happens when you accept cash, we no longer do it in the City. So we got to be careful with that because , you know, loss, you know, risk of loss, misappropriation . So what else? But I just want to report this out because these concerns I've been getting phone calls since we got our bills 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 last week. They are valid concerns . So we got to keep our eye on the escrow piece because that might be a problem for folks -- like the local banks I guess the City contact ed. So that's fine. But not everybody deals with a local bank. There's various mortgage institution s throughout the country that aren't going to have their head around this and might not pay it. And then, you know, they miss the grace period or the discount period. So I don't know, like I said, I had a great conversation with Mary Jo. And she said she's there to help with any questions . She said any questions that come to you, the rest of us, please give them to her or forward them back into that direction so she can address them. All right. And like I said, of course, like the new graphic that we just received and it's on the website, you know, that's very helpful too how to get people and reach out and get their concerns taken care of. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 much. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't have any motions or comments right now. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just have a few. There's going to be a meeting tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. I'm not going to be able to make it. It was short notice. I just found out today about the issues on Third Avenue. So the Mayor, Chief of Police, DPW Director , other City officials will be there. I know Kevin -- our Solicitor Kevin Hayes is going to be there. I'm not sure if anyone else was copied on it. But, Kyle, if you want to attend in my place or Mark, there could be two of you. So if you want to work that out between yourselves and anyone that is interested and you would like to attend that, I could forward you the Zoom link. And then hopefully we could update everyone next week. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 So that was that. Mark answered a lot of the questions about the garbage fee exemptions which is good. So the City did put a helpful kind of frequently asked question graphic on the website. So if any residents do have any questions as Councilman McAndrew said, go to the website and -- or call the Treasurer 's Office and they will help you out. The one thing I think we do have to confirm though is that it's, you know, what I'm hearing from some people is that they're getting the exemption letter from the Treasurer 's Office that they are exempt from the garbage fee for whatever reason. But then when they take it to the Single Tax Office they're being told that they can't honor it. So I don't know where the mix up is there. But I did speak to the Mayor today briefly . So we're going to try to confirm that. Other than that, I just wanted to end with again as I said at the beginning of the meeting how, you know, sorry I am and I know all us are and the prayers that we extend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 to all of those people in our community here in Lackawanna County who have lost a loved one from the Coronavirus pandemic . At this point we're over 400 people. And the other day we marked an extraordinary milestone in 500,000 people dead in the United States from this virus. And it's just unbelievable to me that we're coming up on a year here in March where, you know, the whole country basically shut down. So it really puts things in perspective on how life is so very short. And as I mentioned in the remarks at the beginning of the meeting that it's really easy to become numb to that number because we do see that death toll every day in the newspaper and on the news. But it's much more than that and that, you know, we're losing -- people are losing fathers and mothers and grandmothers , grandparents , sons and daughters . So again, I just wanted to make that remark for the record that our prayers do go out to all the people in our community who have lost somebody to this virus. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 We're not out of the woods yet but there is a lot of cause for hope with the vaccine s and the numbers going down at this point. So hopefully in the next few months we'll start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I mean, I think we're seeing it now but hopefully better days are ahead. And that's all I have for tonight . MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR CONSULTANT SELECTION FORM AS IT RELATES TO WORKING WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO SELECT AN APPROPRIATE ENGINEER CONSULTANT FOR THE MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDS GRANT FOR THE COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF THE ASH STREET BRIDGE. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? All 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION - A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO THE REVISED AGREEMENT FOR COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT MUNICIPAL CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON WITH PORTNOFF LAW ASSOCIATES , LTD. FOR COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT MUNICIPAL CLAIMS. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , Kevin, just for the record, can you go through again as you did in the caucus tonight the changes that had been made to this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 contract that Council had proposed ? Oh, you're muted, Kevin. ATTY. HAYES: Sorry, about that. So the amended agreement between the City and Portnoff , first it specifies the scope of the contract which is consistent with the RFP. The scope being that they're tasked with collect ing the delinquent refuse fees from 2002 through 2020. The agreement would begin -- would expire in December of 2022. The City and Portnoff if they wish to extend the contract another year beyond December of 2022 will have to come to Council 90 days prior to the expiration of the contract . The biggest thing that Council wanted which is included in this amended agreement is to take -- to have control over outstanding legal fees and bills that could be amassed during the course of this contract . So what we requested and what Portnoff has agreed to is that at no time will the City ever be responsible for more than $50,000 worth of legal fees and costs which they have incurred in performance of this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 contract . That's important because in the event we want to terminate this agreement for whatever reason, not saying we would want to. But if we wanted to, at the time of termination we would not be responsible for any fees over $50,000. And I think the members of Council understand why that's important based on prior vendors and prior contracts that the City had engaged in -- prior administrations that'd be. However , the cap of 50,000 does not include fees that they will -- that Portnoff is allowed to incur in establishing accounts . So the $40 initiation fee for each account that Portnoff begins. And anything in excess of $50,000 can be paid back to Portnoff once the City receives payment from those delinquent property owners. So those are the major changes . Most of -- oh, we also -- Council propose d the specific grounds for termination that the City would have and those include any violation of any criminal -- criminal statute , any violation of the City Ethics Code would be grounds for termination , immediate termination. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 We all understand why that's important here. So I think that what we have in front of us is a much improved agreement . And if there's any questions now or over the course of the next few days from Council , please feel free to bring those to me. But overall we made -- major improvements have been made to that agreement . MR. GAUGHAN : Thanks, Kevin. Yeah, I'm going to take the next week to continue to go through this contract . I will say this. Before the end of last year, what we received quite frankly was a bad deal for the City. We received a contract that was not a good deal for the taxpayers and the resident s of Scranton . So Council did its due diligence , took its time, tabled it against the oppositions of some in the administration and really took a look at it to make sure that we weren't going to get raked over the coals in terms of signing a contract that wouldn't be in the best interest of the City, the City taxpayer s and the City residents . So the deal that we have in front of us, the contract that we have in front of us I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 think it at first blush is much better than what we had originally received . So Council really performed its role as oversight and its function as a check on, you know, the administration and those things that come down that we're supposed to look at with a microscope and a magnifying glass. And we did just that. This was especially important to me and I know other members of Council in light of the contract that we had previously been in. So some of the maybe mistakes of the past I think have been righted now. And we're in a better position as a City moving forward should we ever want to get out of this contract or look at another vendor or maybe bring in-house, something to that effect. So again, based on my first -- my first blush assessment of this contract I'm pleased . The second thing I wanted to say was I am disappoint ed in the fact that, you know, the Mayor is -- and, you know, there's two different opinions , two different sides of this, two different ways to look at it but that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 the Mayor is not on board with the one-time grace period. We did vote on something a few weeks ago that I was in favor of. But I don't think it goes far enough. I think being a distressed City as Scranton is, we're leaving potentially millions of dollars on the table here but not having a one-time grace period for delinquent -- people who owe delinquent refuse fees. I know there is some people out there that disagree with that. But we're in a position where we need money for next year. We're looking down a barrel of 4 million -- in the area of a 4 million dollar deficit . So this a creative way to come up with that money. The Mayor and her administration see it another way and that's fine. I just -- I'm disappoint ed because I think we're leaving some serious dollars on the table. The one question that I do have that I'd like to get answered before final passage is on the contract that we did have with NRS. There was a question that was posed in last year I think November and December of how much 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 we actually owe NRS as we were parting ways with them. So there was a number that was thrown around I think when Solicitor O'Brien was in our caucus. I'd like to know if we have a definitive number what we actually -- what the City is actually going to owe them, if anything . I don't know. If we could find that out, I'd appreciate that. And then the other thing that I'll end with tonight is just to we'll check with the -- I'd like to check with the administration to make sure that everybody is still on board with potentially having the county collect delinquent refuse fees moving forward . I know that that was also a point of discussion when we were talking about this last year. So we'll make sure that that has not changed. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I'd have to agree with President Gaughan . I think we got a much better deal here. My goal in looking at this contract a few weeks ago was to avoid the pitfalls and the mistakes of that last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 contract . And, you know, if we were ever to get into a situation where we weren't happy with the deal, we could get out of it without -- without having to pay the company off. So I'm happy to say that the suggestions I put in were taken into consideration and added to this. And at this point in time I'm happy with what we have in front of us tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. Very good. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A MASTER LEASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON , HEREINAFTER DESIGNATED (“LESSOR”) AND CELLCO PARTNERSHIP D/B/A VERIZON WIRELESS , WITH ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICES AT ONE VERIZON WAY, MAIL STOP 4AW100, BASKING RIDGE, NEW JERSEY 07920 (“LESSEE”) TO LEASE SPACE TO LESSEE WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR SITES AT WHICH LESSEE WISHES TO INSTALL , MAINTAIN , AND OPERATE , SMALL CELL COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT , AS WELL AS ANY AND ALL NECESSARY LEASE SUPPLEMENTS OUTLINED HEREIN. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 the question , this is another example of the original legislation that we received last year. Again, I didn't feel it was in the best interest of the residents of our City and residents specifically in our neighborhood s. It came down to us with no design standards included in here so Verizon , you know, there wasn't any sort of standards that were located in the legislation . So I got together with Solicitor Hayes. And he was able to work with Don King our City Planner and members of the administration so that the City is now going to incorporate the design standards into this legislation which would be forwarded into the changes that are going to be made through the Scranton Abington Planning Association , SAPA. Kevin, do you have anything to add to that? ATTY. HAYES: Yeah, so what's before Council now is an amended agreement between Verizon and the City. As Council President just indicated , the legislation was initial ly introduced in December . We tabled it because there was no design standards included in the agreement .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Basically the agreement said if new design standards are adopted after this agreement is executed , Verizon will be subjected to them because the agreement was signed prior to that. Now, we all know that Don King and others are working very hard to develop the comprehensive SAPA Plan which is also almost near implementation . So what we did was, we incorporat ed design standards that were for small cell facilities which were developed by SAPA. And we included those in this agreement so that there are now certain standards that Verizon and any other wireless provider going forward will have to follow with regard to setbacks, with regard to size, with regard to height because obviously as you understand these are going to be more and more prevalent in the City. They're important for our citizens to have these cell towers so that we have as much coverage as possible . But we don't want, you know, have cell coverage without also having protection of the aesthetic , you know, beauty of the City and the architectural 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 integrity of the City. So we got those in there. And going -- now going forward , every wireless provider will be subject to the same design standards . MR. GAUGHAN : Thanks, Kevin. And I want to thank too Don King our City Planner . He's a huge asset to the City. And really, he's been working for the City so long and has so much knowledge , you know, I always call him the encyclopedia of City Hall because if you have a question about anything related to the City, about planning , you know, he's really the go-to person. So I do want to thank him because he answers -- answers you right away when you have a question . Very helpful . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.

On the question , I'll be voting for this piece of legislation . I think it's very important that we do everything in our power to make sure that any type of fee in the City is affordable for our residents . The fee that was in place for the dog license was just, you know, it was very expensive and to have to pay it every single year it was very onerous on our resident s. So this brings it in line with other communities . And I think it's much more affordable . So I'll be voting yes. Anyone else on the question ? ATTY. HAYES: Mr. President , on the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. ATTY. HAYES: On the question , Councilman McAndrew , you had inquired -- you had asked me to inquire as to whether the City currently imposes any type of delinquent fees 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 or penalties for failure for dog owners to make the -- to pay this license fee. And the response that I got from Eileen Cipriani is that they do not -- they do not penalize people for not paying the license fee. And they don't pursue delinquent fees. That's the current practice . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thanks. I just want to wrap my head around the process because it wasn't -- ATTY. HAYES: Right. I didn't understand it myself.
