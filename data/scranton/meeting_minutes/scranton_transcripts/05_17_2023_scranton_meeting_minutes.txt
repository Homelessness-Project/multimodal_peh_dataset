KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SMURL: I have one. The Everhart Museum is having a Community Day, Saturday , May 20th. It's free admission from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. And they are also having 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 free activities between 12 p.m. and 4 p.m. That's it. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. My announcement is I want to congratulate three of my colleagues sitting up here on their elections last evening . Great job. I know that you still have to continue on for the general election but it was nice to see everyone was successful last evening . Does anyone else have anything ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. I was going to save that for Fifth Order. But while you're congratulating our colleagues , congratulations to everyone up here who will move onto November and everybody who ran in the race yesterday congratulations to all of them. It's an accomplishment when you throw your hat in the ring. So great job, everyone . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Before we move onto Fourth Order, just a gentle reminder about some Council rules. I'll mention two things. One of the rules -- there's obviously a list of Council rules. But just a gentle reminder that no person including members of Council shall use their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 time during citizens participation to personal ly insult or attack an individual . And also, name calling , profanity, racial or ethnic slurs and any other behavior that is inconsistent with the purpose and intent of conducting official business shall be permitted . I will say generally that does not occur in these chambers . But I just felt it was important that I announce that this evening . Thank you. Fourth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I too have my congratulations to Mr. McAndrew , Mr. Smurl, and Dr. Rothchild . You know, you should be very happy. John Murray was pouting all morning long because he got more votes than any of you and he didn't even get a mention in the newspaper . But that's the way it goes when you run unopposed . Something I want to mention , there was a story in the paper on May 12th. These are 12 students who were part of the Miguel Nativity School that started 5th grade eight 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 years ago. Sometimes you have people who come to the podium and complain about immigrant s overall insinuating that all immigrant s are illegal and they don't speak English and they contribute nothing and they are just sucking our tax dollars dry. If you read the story of these eight children , okay, they are now graduating high school. They came here eight or nine years ago. Most of them spoke little or no English . Their parents are working . Their parents are paying taxes. Seven of the eight are going onto universities . And they've done very, very well. And I'm very proud of them. I hope this is the kind of immigrant s that we attract to the city in the future. Now, Item 5-E, which is the legislation for the new auditor . I read through the contract . And low and behold there are two things missing . There's no timeline saying when the audit is due as there was for Kohanski . And there's no 10 percent penalty clause. Go figure. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 If you could though, if you could through the administration , find out when they intend to deliver the audit so we have an idea. And if they could give periodic reports on their progress that would be helpful . Also (inaudible ) on May 12th on the website the DPW contract and that was -- I was very happy. It only took eight months to get it posted which brings me to a question . How long do you think it will be before we see the firefighter s' contract which has been finalized in April? Do you think before the end of the year? MR. KING: I'm not going to guess, Joan. But I will inquire . Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask the administration when they expect they they're going to be able to have that fire contract available to post? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MS. HODOWANITZ : Are we making any progress on the arbitration for the police contract ? MR. KING: I believe that is happening in the next week or so. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Just be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 aware then in April according to the Controller 's report, Ufberg who is the counsel for -- labor counsel got paid $35,591.18. So he's raking it in month after month. Item 3-A, the payroll preparation tax summary , I don't understand the numbers for fiscal year 2023. They show 2022 first quarter one point -- $408,000 for the first quarter of last year. This year $3,847.54. And they break that down again. And fourth quarter entry and fourth quarter of 2023 is yet to come. Can somebody clarify the numbers they had given for 2023? They are confusing. And let's see what else. Any possibility of replacement for Matt Domines ' as the finance director ? I see his contract is in the legislation . But they are actively looking for a replacement. No takers? MR. KING: Not at this time. MS. HODOWANITZ : And I see that Eileen Cipriani is going to be paid $120,000; $85,000 as BA and then the $35,000 wearing her ARPA hat. Is she paying wage tax to the city because she doesn't live in the city? Are you sure? And has she been paying that wage tax 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 since day one? MR. KING: We could inquire . MS. HODOWANITZ : You should. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Ms. Hodowanitz , that was something that I requested when we approved for the waiver. In the beginning she was. I don't know -- MS. HODOWANITZ : There's an indication that she didn't pay it in 2021. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , if we could just inquire about that with the administration . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I too want to add my congratulations to those that were successful yesterday . And following them through their campaign , it's not an easy job that they are doing. So if anyone just thinks that it's a piece of cake when someone throws their hat in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 the ring and gets out night after night and day after day so they could get back to their families now to do their regular activity . So I do congratulate them all as putting their hat in the ring to try to make Scranton a better city and a place for all of us. So congratulations to you all. The second thing that I wanted to ask about just came up today. When we read the reading of the minutes in Item D and it says December 31, 2021. Is that 2021 that it took that many years to get those minutes into us or is that a typing error? MR. KING: I believe that's accurate . MS. JEFFRIES : It just seemed kind of strange that it was so long for it to get in there to become a public record. So that is why I asked that question as well. And then the other thing that is on my mind is I was out of town for two weeks. I was visiting my son that is down in the Media Springfield area. And after everybody was gone for the day and I was there by myself having my coffee before I started the day I heard all of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 this noise outside . And I thought , what's that? So I go out to the porch there and look outside and low and behold it's City of Springfield, Delaware County changing street signs. I said, oh, great, street signs are following me no matter where I go. So I thought I said, gee, the street sign isn't even bad so why are they out there and what were they doing? So I sort of watched them as they did their work. They basically changed the pole and the sign was very visible . So, of course, that then puts this question in my mind about our street signs here in Scranton . And the last time as I drove through the city, I just see no additional street signs. I was given a report of at least, oh, I guess it might be 75 pages or more of the street sign status as to how they were going to be changed . It didn't make too much sense to me because a lot of the things that were reported in that report did not deal with the changing of the street signs. It dealt with handicap signs and stop sign and things like that. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 I just -- you know, it just baffles me when I come back to Scranton and I see as soon as you hit the city and to see so many street signs that are missing or inadequate that we can't make them out, especially in South Side. I was down in South Side to do some things. And I was thinking if it wasn't for my phone I don't think I would have gotten to where I needed to go without that assistance . I just kept thinking if they did ten a month, you know, certainly we could see some additional improvements with our street signs. And I know that in Delaware county they've got Baltimore Pike, which is just loaded and I'm sure their tax dollars coming in from all that business activity in their area. But still, I just cannot understand . And it just baffles me as to why we can't at least have -- if we did ten a month we would make some kind of headway into the 9,000 -- 9,000 entries on this database that I was shown once. So, you know, first the machine was broken and then it's not. So I don't know what is going on down there. But I think as a citizen of Scranton and not just myself, it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 all the citizens of Scranton would like to see some further improvement with the street signs in Scranton . And we've got a lot of activity going on coming up this summer. And it would be great if we did not have to depend on our phones to get us to where we needed to go. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Mr. Voldenberg , can we inquire with DPW, get a status report as far as the signs and kind of get an idea of what the game plan is there to address that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that tomorrow , sir. MR. KING: Thank you very much. Les Spindler . MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me, Mr. Spindler , before they start the clock for you -- no, come on in. I just want to let you know you weren't here the past two weeks. And it was reported out from DPW they didn't have any containers to replace the ash cans that they, you know, took my by mistake . And you've been waiting a year, so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Mr. Schuster and I chipped in and got you two ash cans. They're right there for you. So don't leave without them, all right? We want to make you whole. MR. SPINDLER : Thank you very much. I don't think it was your responsibility to do that. That was very thought ful of the two of you. And I really appreciate it. MR. MCANDREW : Didn't have to but we wanted to. MR. SPINDLER : Thank you very much. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Go ahead. Now you could talk. MR. SPINDLER : My wife and I have been living in our residence which we bought in 1989. It's 34 years now. And last year I receive d a letter from Berkheimer about I'm not reporting taxes on my business . I've never had a business in my life. So I just ignored it. This year I got the same letter. So I called just the other day. And the woman said you if have a rental property , it's considered a business . I said what? I said I'm not selling anything . A business is if you're selling something for profit. Well, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 when we took it over, the city never charged . And now we started charging . Long story short, the woman told me as of last year that was changed . It's not considered a business . But they want me to send a copy of my Schedule E. And they would take me off the records . I said, why is it even necessary ? If it's not a law anymore, why do I have to send it in? Well, we need it to get you off our records . So I called my account ant's office. I said -- oh, he said you're not the only one with this problem . We helped everybody out, just bring the letter and we'll take care of it. So I did that. I took the letter over and they said they'll take care of it. It's unnecessary . They said when they took over -- I got the letter last year. They've been collecting taxes for the city more than two years, haven't they? So it was an out and out lie what she told me. So I -- and I said they never should have been hired. They are a bunch of incompetent people that work there. And last year's letters were sent to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 people too. It's almost a form of harassment. I shouldn 't have to go through what I did. Hopefully it will be all taken care of. Once again, I'd like to know if there is anything that Council heard about the intersection where I live that was suppose d to be fixed. MR. KING: I think I reported on that in Fifth Order last week. MR. SPINDLER : I wasn't here and I didn't watch. But they were suppose d to fix the whole intersection . But my corner first of all is -- every week, every rainstorm it just deteriorates more and I get more water in front of my house. MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe they are going to make that part of the public paving project . And until that time they're not doing anything to alleviate the problem -- MR. KING: That's correct . That's -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have them contact Mr. Spindler tomorrow and explain it from a DPW standpoint . MR. KING: All right. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Apparently that road is scheduled for paving and they don't want -- MR. SPINDLER : Oh, it is? MR. KING: Yeah. MR. SPINDLER : Boy, that's a surprise because that road was paved not that many years ago. MR. KING: Well, and I believe , you know, they want to make sure -- they'll address it before they do the paving. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Lastly, I spoke about this before, all this terrible gun violence in our country . It's just unbelievable how many innocent people are being killed. I was happy to see at least one state took action. It was on the news the other day that the state of Illinois passed a law banning assault weapons . So if they could do that, why isn't it just a country wide law, a national law? If one state can do it, why can't we all do it? I found it a little unbelievable . These politicians have to get off their butts and get together and make this country safe for people to live in.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 If Illinois can do it, the whole state, the whole country should be able to do it. And that's all I have to say tonight . Thank you for your time. MR. MCANDREW : Don't forget your cans. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Thank you. MR. KING: Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Bol Bolus, Scranton . Maybe Les will use that to pick up everybody else's garbage , give him something to do, keep him out of trouble . And I was looking at this where we're talking about $500,000 in Nay Aug Park for courts and stuff like that. It's such a waste of money that we're throwing away in Nay Aug when we got -- destroyed the pool and why we all went to Nay Aug Park, the recreation part of it. And it's an embarrassment . I think what you could do is maybe talk to Geisinger since everybody is yelling about where to park. As you know, the Recreation Authority gave them the parking up there for almost a couple hundred cars. It averages out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 maybe a dollar a day. I filed a lawsuit over it because I think it was a squandering waste of our property . Ask them to pay for the court and put this money in trying to resurrect a pool and do something that is intelligent for people, something that we all grew up with, not what people today know about. When we were kids we used to go to Nay Aug Park on Easter. They went to the zoo. It was a family affair to go there. And we've destroyed it right here in the City of Scranton . We destroyed the pool. We destroyed the reason families can't go there and enjoy themselves . Now you want to put this in for somebody to play tennis and all of that. It's a joke. We're just wasting money and we're not taking care of the thing that is most important to the economy and the growth of this place is to be able to go somewhere and enjoy a swim. None of us are going to want to go to a splash park. Can you see all of us, all our gray heads walking around yelling whoopie , we're happy. We're in splash park. That's what's wrong with it. And we got to make the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 changes . And we got to take the hard-core attitude of what we need to bring it back. You know, we watched it go down the toilet day in and day out. I brought up -- I listened to the chief when he was talking . You know, we should be charging minimum of two hours for a fire truck or any apparatus that goes out and what it costs us. And we figure just like we do in the companies , we got to replace it. You got to do this. You add it all in to what the cost should be. Maybe as a thousand dollars , $1,500 to send that truck out a minimum two hours. The insurance company pays for it. We need that to start happening in our police department , our fire department . We need to take our DPW after they're done with their routes, start picking up commercially in the city because we have a dumping contract . We have a tipping fee that we could live with and bring in extra money that would pay for our equipment and stuff and take it off the back -- burden of our people in the city and start looking in different direction s as though we were a business here.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 And we are. This is a business . We deal with it every day. Are we happy about the Biden signs that Gaughan put up in Scranton ? No. Some are. Some aren't. But you never took into consideration all of us in Scranton when he was sitting up here to put it on a referendum . And we go to the polls and vote, do we want Spruce Street back or do we want Biden Street, the embarrassment we're having around the country from this guy and his family. Yet, Scranton is always mentioned . And we are Scranton . It's not an individual . It's all of us in this city, whether you're a Republican , Independent , Democrat or whatever the heck you are. But when Gaughan and everybody did all of this, they took away our voice. And I'd like to see our voice come back in at the polls to vote for whether we want Biden's name on the street sign, on the expressway or along 81 where people think we all sit here and enjoy what they are doing to our country , our people, opening the floodgates and said, here, come on in. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 My grandfather s and grandmother s came to this country . They came through as immigrants . And they came through the right way. Why is Biden allowing all of these people just to rush in here and we sit there and say, okay, go ahead, run wherever you want to go. Our country is destroyed . We put uniform s on to defend our country . And we're giving away -- with this idiot, we're giving our country away and we're embarrassing the people in Scranton that are supporting him. I'm asking now of Council to go for a resolution right now or a vote to change the streets and get his name off the streets . He's got his place where he lived. That's enough. But don't embarrass all of us as Gaughan did, what he's done. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . You know, there was an apartment house that was closed down up on Vine Street. I think it's somewhere -- it's around Vine and Colfax -- Prescott . And the reason it was closed down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 was because they found two overdosed deaths and somebody else just about hovering near the pearly gates. But 25 people were forced to move out of there. And naturally , they probably all weren't involved in drugs. And I would recommend that we -- if we want to punish an apartment with 25 people being out of a house and home from around Christmas time, I could only imagine the problems we might have created for people that weren't involved . So it's just something to consider . And congratulations to the winners and condolences to the people that didn't make it. If you go on the trolley ride down at the Trolley Museum, just before you turn to go into the tunnel that will be on your right and cross the brook. And then on your left is an entrance to a mine that probably was abandoned 110 years ago. And the point being that that mine is aimed right at the Nay Aug area. So we probably have a great deal of land up there that's undermined. And the -- going downstairs with their underground with the parking garages 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 for Geisinger is probably a fantasy . You might have to have wind up driving pillars down just to be able to build on top of it. And once again, I'm going to mention Geisinger was acquired by a hospital conglomerate on the west coast. And they -- and Kaiser -- I was talking to my doctor last week. And he had some Jewish kids he services the people at Yeshiva . And he was never paid for student s that were covered by Kaiser insurance on the west coast. The point being, that either you're in their network or you don't get help with the payments . And it's -- I certainly hope -- they say not in the article ; but I certainly hope that Geisinger doesn't wind up some day taking in only their insurance . And once again the tax exempts , what I've always proposed so people understand is that the tax exempts in this town -- I don't care if they are nonprofit s or if they're some kind of government building or whatever , band together and get together with us and go together with us to Harrisburg and start to press for compensation for Scranton because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 we're probably drifting onto 40 percent tax exempt. I was at a -- at a school meeting . And it was a long time ago. But a man named Chris Phillips stood up. He was running for the school board. And his claim was from 92 to 2009, the University of Scranton cost the school taxes 28 million dollars . That's a lot of money. And naturally , you know, a nonprofit really shouldn 't pay taxes. The student s would have to pay those taxes. But the point is, they could band together with us and start to get some kind of motion on this but because 40 percent is starting to become insufferable. Have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn son. That exhausts the sign in list. Would anyone else like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Good evening , members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . First I want to address 3-D on the agenda tonight . What I find interesting in looking through that is on page four which is actually page 12 of the document . It has a four on the bottom of it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 It lists as nonresident tax collected that the -- under tax code 30500, the estimated revenue for the city was $100,000. The actual revenue collected according to that document was zero dollars and zero cents. Well, we all know for a fact that Miss Cipriani started with this body 5/18 of 2020 and has worked all the way through . So I don't know how the -- how it's possible when city employees who we know have waivers of employment that as part of the waiver of employment that they've agreed to pay nonresident taxes that the City of Scranton according to it's own financial audit has not collected a single penny for nonresident taxes. Are you also from that report meaning to tell me that no people who work in Scranton actually live outside the City of Scranton ? Why is it zero? How is that possible ? Does anyone have an explanation of how we are not receiving any our nonresident taxes? MR. MCANDREW : Good question . MR. COYNE: Moving on. 7-A, it's amazing that the pool requires a survey. A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 second survey, then an overall comprehensive plot for Nay Aug plan before we could even consider putting forward funding to decide where a pool goes. But we could put through a grant for $500,000 to use a multiple purpose Nay Aug Park plan with no physical plan, with no instruction s, with nothing of where it's going to go. But it's fine to requisition money for pickleball courts and cement covering and gazebos with no direction on where any of that is going to be placed. But when it comes to a pool, well, we can't get any money allocated to that until we have iron concrete plans for plans for plans. I'd strike it generally just for that and say without an idea -- because if I was the Mayor, I would take that concrete and some of that pavilion and I would put it right over the pool complex so that you guys couldn't build a pool and it would shut you up. That way there could only be a splash pad there and no one would have to worry about the pool anymore , not that anyone would be that nefarious that has a plan and I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 see that happening , but it's always a possibility . The rental fee that I brought up, rental fee for the city is $45 per unit. Looking at the University of Scranton I crunched the numbers. According to their pages of 2020 the last out, full-time students are 4,638 students , 89 percent of them go to student housing according to their own document s. That is $4,127 students in housing . Take the $45 times all of those units that are being housed and what would the city get, $185,715. Wow, that's actually more than the pilot that they're paying. I guess we don't need the money. We need to start bringing that in because that's money that needs to come into the city. And if regular citizens are paying it, universities that are making a lot more need to pay it. I have a problem with the dual position for OECD. If OECD is getting the new position , that person should get the extra money for the ARPA fund so they should be in charge of it, not Cipriani . She shouldn 't have a dual role. If 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 she's moving, she should move over and whoever the new OECD person is, they should actually be the ones who are in charge of dealing with the ARPA administration funding . And on the last point of that is, since she's in the new position , she is now no longer on the old one and has a residency require ment here. She had a waiver for the old position . She needs to move here to Scranton for the six months -- for six months from the day she took it out or get another exception . And she shouldn 't get that because if she wants to be -- as a Business Administrator and it's interest ing in holding that position , Luzerne County has that position and she should go there. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, a couple. A few weeks back we were -- I discussed Adams Avenue and North Washington Avenue behind the old 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 Central High School where they had merged together . I believe it was PennDOT and the city went down. It is all repainted now. The lanes are very specific now so there are not two cars coming across at the same time now where they try to all merge together . So that is all complete over there. And I've got a late complaint for the 1100 block of Jackson Street about commercial trucks parked there, cars parked on sidewalks and over the curbs and stuff. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I had forwarded that to you a little while ago. So if you will forward that to the Law Department again about the commercial vehicle s and cars on sidewalks and also, a copy to the Chief also with that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you. My last thing is Nay Aug pool. We've had a meeting about Nay Aug pool. We have started talking about it what we want up there. And it is moving. So that's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MR. SCHUSTER : I got to get out a little bit yesterday and I did get a list of complaints that I took throughout the day. So I'll get them over to Mr. Voldenberg . And I know Mr. King said last week that the Mayor is looking into the U of S rental fee. So that is something that I would like to see. So maybe if we can send something over to see where we are in regards to the rental fee for the University of Scranton apartments . Did we ever get -- we got somewhat of an update when I put in a list of complaints around the Alpha Street, North Main Avenue, Parker Street area. I know we got a little bit back. But have we had any updates on that since then? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not in the last week, sir. I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Yeah, I took a drive through there yesterday . And some of those which appear to be abandon ed cars were still in that area, nothing has really changed in terms of the cars. Other than that, I'll send some e-mails over to you, Frank, about what I received yesterday . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, sir. MR. KING: Is that it? MR. SHUSTER : That's good. MR. KING: Thank you. Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I've received a few complaint s that I wanted to forward along to the appropriate departments . The first one being 1718 Taylor Avenue, there were new owners out of town landlords that took over the property . And according to neighbors , they're looking to convert it to student housing or they're currently in the process of that. And the person who contact ed me had a question regarding the zoning if it was appropriate for them to create student housing on that property because they think not. So if we could please forward to code enforcement and zoning to sort that out to determine if they are allowed to have student housing at that property . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And then for 642 Birch Street, it's an empty lot owned 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 by the Land Bank that is overgrown and needs to be cut. So I wanted to forward that to DPW. I know that Councilman Smurl has been also been taking care of some of those properties , but I just wanted to make sure they are aware of it as well and so they could sort out who is going to take care of that property . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And lastly, 336 Geraldine Court, it's littered with trash outside . I saw picture s of it. And it's in pretty bad shape. So I'd like code enforcement to get over there and then, you know, perhaps DPW to help with it if that's part of their responsibility . But I think it would be on the owner to clean the trash up that is along the side of the property . MR. VOLDENBERG : That's been reported . I don't know what the delay is. I'll find out. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. And that is everything I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I just have one thing tonight . I know I'm a broken record when it comes to Weston Field, the lovely ladies that try to use that pool every day. I don't mind being a broken record for them because they have been very patient . And they are still without a Parks and Rec Director . And I remember last year even before they hired the one that just left that by request of one of the swimmers which was a great idea, during the interview process when you hire the Parks and Rec Director make sure that they're certified in lifeguard training . Their office is going to be there. They could help out when there's little snafus where they don't have a lifeguard. So my understanding , they are still without lifeguard s. They is no consistent swim days for them. They are paying members . So, I don't know, like most of the time with regard to the pool and the splash pad, Lackawanna is getting that right. Lackawanna also got it right with developing or signing a contract with American 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Red Cross. So they'll provide lifeguard s for them and also free training paid by them to get and acquire lifeguards . So please reach out to administration and ask them, hey, why can't we not utilize the same services from American Red Cross? Let's enter a contract . What we're doing isn't working. They're failing these paying members . So please look into that and make sure that the resident was heard about the certification process for the new director . They should have that cert. It makes sense. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Frank. MR. KING: When Mr. Smurl and I met with the Mayor the other day concerning the pool -- and I will say we were pretty adamant about the fact that we do want a pool at Nay Aug Park. I think she is coming around to the idea that five members sitting on this Council want to see a swimming pool at Nay Aug Park. And I think that ultimately we're going to try to make that happen. But it was brought up about lifeguards . She indicated that they increased the hourly rate to $16 an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 hour for lifeguards . And I believe it was brought up about Red Cross. So Eileen Cipriani is going to contact the Red Cross, the very thing that you just mentioned concerning lifeguards because that is important . And, you know, as you said, those residents , they pay a fee down there at Weston Field for that indoor pool. And it's not right that they don't have the opportunity to utilize the pool on a regular basis since they are, you know, they're paying that fee -- I'm sorry -- DR. ROTHCHILD : Councilman King, I'm sorry. I was just wondering did they say if the increase in their wage has increased the amount of applicant s that they have for lifeguards ? MR. KING: I don't know that answer. MR. SMURL: No. They -- when she said that, they were increasing the wage, I had to remember the county had said they use the American Red Cross. And I said instead of us going through all of that, putting them on our payroll and going through all of that, why don't we look into that first. And Eileen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Cipriani said that she would look into that. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you, I'm sorry. MR. KING: We did have an executive session this evening to discuss contracts . Also in terms of some followup for Joan Hodowanitz , City of Scranton audit summary will be advertise d in the newspaper on Friday, May 19th. Also there was a request from Joan concerning Dr. Andrea LaZella . We did research and found that he was reappointed to the City of Scranton Ethics Board for a term expiring on August 31st, 2027 under Resolution No. 113, 2022. Now, for Marie Schumacher , she had brought up 842 Moosic Street. There was garbage on Moosic Street. A door tag was issued on April 11th followed by citation totaling a hundred dollars on May 17th. Also, she was sent the 2023 paving list from a request . Some issues that were brought to me recently on Mountain Lake Road, DPW is going to visit that address to review some water issues 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 at the base of a home at the homeowner 's driveway . Also, 1515 Cherry Street, that resident has been waiting for a DPW vehicle to come up and address -- there was a request to have the vac truck come up and check the drainage lines at the end of his driveway extending out into the roadway . From what I understand the vac truck has been down for a few weeks. It's being repaired. So hopefully they're going to be able to get up there to check those drainage lines. Also, 2200 block of Winfield Avenue, I had to request that the Scranton Police Department review a resident 's claim regarding speeding and double parking and traffic issues behind Kennedy Elementary School. And there's obviously concerns that somebody may get hit with a vehicle or a bus for that matter. So we've asked the Scranton Fire Department to look into the matter. Also, the DPW contract is posted now on the website . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

VOLDENBERG : 5-D. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT – EXTENSION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 WITH MATTHEW DOMINES TO PROVIDE FINANCE DIRECTOR SERVICES TO THE CITY OF SCRANTON MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question . MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , so looking at the backup of this document , there's a couple things I noticed that we have a vacancy for a finance director. I know we use grant money to put Mr. Domines ' in the position that he's in right now. But I didn't realize he hadn't accepted this position and they're actively looking for someone to fill the position . I really honestly would have liked to have seen Mr. Domines ' apply for the BA's position . I would have been in agreement with that. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can we look at -- can we ask the administration for a timeline of these funds? We had a $50,000 grant that was going to go towards research into the lowering 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 of taxes in Scranton . That money was then switched over to keep -- to put this position or to fund this position . So now what I'm seeing is the pay rate here under this contract is $85,000 a year, which some of that money had to come somewhere to make up that difference when the funding for the position is actually $56,610. So if we could get -- before I approve this in final passage , if we could get a timeline of where the funding sources came from, how Mr. Domines ' was paid in the 2022 year, and how we're making up these differences . That would be very helpful for me to pass this. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Also on the question , I agree. How are we paying this gentleman ? I mean, he's done a great job. I actually voted against him because I thought there was enough employees that should stand up and do the job, right? But now he was being paid by a grant. So I agree with Mr. Schuster . How 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 are we going to pay him even if it's 7,000 a month moving forward until they replace him, I'd like to know that before final passage . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find that out, sir. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-E. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH CLIFTONLARSONALLEN , LLP TO PERFORM THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S INDEPENDENT POST AUDIT AND SINGLE AUDIT FOR YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2022, 2023, AND 2024. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? On the question , as Mrs. Hodowanitz had indicated , there is no timeline indicated in there as to when it is due. I think the expectation is that it will be due on time, which would be September 30th. But just if we could ask administration , you know, why that was omitted or can it be added and also inquire about the 10 percent penalty . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree also. I would like to see that specified in there considering the issues that we've had with the contract s in the past. And if we could also ask about her question regarding the penalty fee why that's not included in this contract as well. MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , Solicitor Gallagher , I also ask that you take a look at this and review if anything stands out to you. ATTY. GALLAGHER : The price, some of the fees at the end. I'll touch base with Frank and get some clarification from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 administration . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Also on the question , how does administration send this piece of legislation down when we had so many problem s with the past three years of getting this audit done on time without having even a date set on it. It's unfathomable . MR. KING: I don't disagree . Although , you know, that's why we go through these reading s. So I'm going to vote to introduce it this evening . But we need to make sure that we get these questions answered and hopefully amend that prior to final passage . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I'm glad that was brought up. If it's not in there, we're not going to expect it at any date. And if we're receiving it when we're receiving it now with a date, I'm not sure when we would get it so thank you. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-F. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF EILEEN CIPRIANI , TO THE POSITION OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR , AS WELL AS AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT DIRECTOR EFFECTIVE MAY 4, 2023. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I consistently voted no for her residency waiver for the simple reason it's not fair to anybody else. And now I'm being asked to approve her appointment for 120-some thousand dollars . She's going to make more than the Mayor. She's going to make more than the Chief of Police. She's going to make more than the Fire Chief. She's going to prepare a budget and decide how residents ' money is being spent not being a resident . So it's nothing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 personal . But I just -- I just -- I can't. I'm a no. MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , Mr. Voldenberg , if we could please look into whether the wage tax was paid for 21, 22 and seeing where we're at with 23. Originally this position was a $52,000 -- well, originally when she was hired with the waiver it was a $52,000 position . At that point in time I didn't think it was enough money to move into the city. I felt I could give a waiver on that. But we changed that salary from 52,000 to 80,000 to 100,000 to 120 at this point in time. I think we should be moving into this city. And as Mr. McAndrew said, if we're going to be dictating how the taxpayer s' money is being spent I think we should be a resident . MR. KING: On the question , Mr. Voldenberg , if you could send a request to the Mayor's office, I'd like to inquire to get the total amount of funding that Eileen Cipriani has brought into this city during her time here working for the city. I think it's -- I think we're going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 to find out that it's substantial . And I think that she's done an excellent job. So I'm going to be supporting that this evening . MR. SCHUSTER : With that being said, the grant funding that we're bringing in, the department that we're in, I think it's probably the best fit to be in that position rather than switching over but -- DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I support Miss Cipriani in the role as BA. I'm also going to support her in this role as ARPA Director , has been integral to the development of ARPA plans for the city. And I don't think anyone working for the city knows ARPA as well as she does. So I think that's why she's been in that position already and is helping to continue to run ARPA. And so I have all the faith that she'll continue to be able to do that in her new role. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. KING: 3-2, the ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 228, 2023 – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE CITY’S ACCEPTANCE AND ADMINISTRATION OF GRANT FUNDS FROM THE REDEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE CAPITAL PROGRAM THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA FOR UP TO $500,000.00 TO BE USED FOR THE NAY AUG MULTIPURPOSE COURTS AND PAVILION PROJECT . MR. KING: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 know I asked last week about the location of these courts. Did we get any response back about the location of the courts, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Other than what Mr. Smurl indicated at the meeting , no. And I'm still waiting on regarding any demolition that will take place on the project . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I'd like to make a motion to table this to hold off until we get that information if anyone would give me a second. MR. MCANDREW : I'll second it. MR. KING: Okay. There's been a motion and a second to table this. On the question ? MR. SMURL: On the question , I did speak with Bob Gattens , Chairman of the Rec Authority at the park. And I spoke with the administration also. I asked that they would both get together and decide where this is going to be placed permanently . But naturally , I'm not going to hold -- try to hold this up. This is too important to our children to stop this. So I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 going to support moving this. MR. KING: Okay. There's been a motion to table Item 7-A and a second. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: No. So we'll go back to the original motion 7-A. On the question again? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'm not going to hold up a grant project but I do see the motion to table has failed. The application date was the first of May. The application has already been sent in. I just felt this was a, you know, Council should be able to get information in a timely manner to make decisions before the items are placed in Seventh Order. That's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 where I'll stand on it. But I won't hold up the grant funding. MR. KING: On the question , I would also ask Mr. Voldenberg if you could please inquire with the administration and find out for us definitely where exactly the plan is to place these courts and if, in fact, the Rec Authority has been involved and maybe a timeline for when that decision will ultimately be made. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MR. MCANDREW : On the question . MR. KING: On the question , I'm sorry. MR. MCANDREW : I'm not holding anything up either. Wanting more information to make a better informed decision is not holding it up for the children or anybody else. It's a week. So, I mean, of course, I'm not going to hold it up now. But asking for a little bit more time to make an informed decision , isn't always a bad idea. MR. SCHUSTER : To the point that Mr. McAndrew just tried to make, as I said, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 deadline for this application was the first of May. So the application is already in. This is just holding up the final passage until Council received the information we requested . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'd like to see this project get moving along. I do appreciate some of the comments before regarding getting a Master Plan for the complex . But I believe there are other comment s about how, like, who wants pickleball courts and, I mean, I think we need to make Nay Aug attractive and useable by all groups of people. And I think there is -- there has been a lot of interest . And this is a sport that's really gained a lot of popularity in its recreation al use. And I support it. And I'm excited to see new things being added to the park. I do, of course, still want to see that as a part of the bigger plan. And I'm looking forward to us getting more information on that hopefully in the near future. MR. SCHUSTER : Again on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 question , this is final passage of approving for the acceptance of the funds. So if the funds were to be awarded, we are preemptively approving the acceptance of those funds. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I don't have any problem with accepting these funds to be used for this purpose . I'm not sure that that information would -- that we're looking for would change my mind on this. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes.
