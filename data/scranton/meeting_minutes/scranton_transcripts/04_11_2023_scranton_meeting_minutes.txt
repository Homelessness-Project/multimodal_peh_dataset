CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION MEETING MINUTES HELD MARCH 7, 2023.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 3.C. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM CITY BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DATED APRIL 4, 2023 REGARDING UPDATED PAYROLL PREPARATION TAX COLLECTIONS . MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So there's going to be a pasta dinner sponsored by the Boy Scout Troop 50, Saturday , May, 6, 2023. And it's at 1227 St. Ann's Street, Scranton , PA. And it's going to be hosted at the St. Ann's food stand. I'm sure you know where that is at the bottom of the hill. Tickets are available at the Rectory office and the Shrine Gift Shop or at the door. It will be $10, serving from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m., takeouts only. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 Scranton . Have we got a date for a caucus on the 2021 audit? MR. KING: We don't at this time. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And has the Mayor made a decision on the 10 percent penalty clause? MR. KING: Not as of yet. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I checked the City's website at 2:15 this afternoon and the DPW contract was still not there. But then it's only been seven months, so no hurry. But I did find something really interesting on the website . This was posted on April 5th. It's the firefighter arbitration award. Have you all seen it and read it? Okay. Well, let me share some of the key points with the public. For wages, for 2022 last year, 135 firefighters will get $2,000 each. That equals $270,000. 2023 this year, they get a 2 percent pay raise, which is about $215,000 for a total of $485,000. Now, during the budget discussions last year I said since DPW is getting a 2 percent pay raise, you ought to at least factor that in for both firefighter s and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 police. No, they were flat, no pay raise. So now we have to come up with that money. I mean, anybody would know that they were going to get a pay raise. But a couple other things of interest . Under the consolidated contract integration section , there's two things that the City has to do. It has to clean up the old expired contract because it's full of unnecessary obsolete superceded and aged-out provisions , got to clean that one up before they could rewrite the new contract which has to be done by August 2, 120 days from April 4th. Now, the question is, which will appear on the City's website first, this contract or the DPW contract ? I'm taking bets. And under the dissent by the union or arbitrator Attorney Holroyd , among other things he commend ed the arbitration panel for quote, not blindly accepting the City's claims of still being on the brink of bankruptcy , unquote. Did you know that? We're on the brink of bankruptcy . I'm sure the Mayor knows it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 And then the city representative which is Attorney Ufberg, he came back with an interesting claim of his own that there are a lot of arbitration -related expenses not further defined. I think that's legal fees. And they would have been avoided had not the unions strung the City out for well over a year and a half before finally pushing the arbitration button that they had available all along. So we don't know what those legal fees are going to run to, which brings us to an overview of some of our financial troubles in the past week or so. Now, we have the trash lawsuit s that were settled . (Inaudible ) slash car case, 2.5 million . Guiffrida was 385,000 minus 50 grand, $335,000. That comes to 2.835 million . Then you add the tax mixup with the Scranton School District . That's another 2.26 million . It takes us up to $5,095,000, add in the $485,000 that you know we know we're probably going to get hit with the firefighter s' contract , 5.58 million dollars . That doesn't include legal fees. And we still have the police 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 arbitration to deal with. They too got no pay raise in 2023. You need to bring in Mayor Cognetti for a caucus on how she's handling these issues. And during Fifth Order, please give us an update on Scranton 's own version of keygate. I'd like to know why a key was left unsecured . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Council , I was at Weston Park last night. I walked around a good hour. I'd like to congratulate the volunteers of the city. They have really cleaned that place up and made it -- cut down wild bushes and so forth. It looked great last night. People -- I don't want people mad at me for trying to say some facts last week. But Nay Aug's, it's done and over with. It's like beating a dead horse listening to people come here. It reminds me of Mr. Clark's group. They're still complaining about their home values after all of these years. It didn't -- the fact is they bought homes across the street from a 100 year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 landfill built on a slag pile. Now, it's the odor. But if you talk to some -- any of those people having a house for sale, there's no odor. The odor is all the properties that they can't sell. And this -- this is a fact. No odor if your house is for sale, odor if you want to get some kind of cash settlement . I don't know. It seems -- it seems to me that Geisinger has just taken advantage of the City of Scranton , their ignorance . When Lackawanna College bought that little building years ago, it didn't take a brain child to realize they would outgrow it immediately . This is what happened . There should have been some restraints -- something done to stop this then. Now, there's no stopping Geisinger . 10, 20 years they'll be huge down there because that's their plan. And the medical school wants a 15 acre area around there. They have no consideration for the property taxes here. If our taxes are going by a third of the taxable properties , then our house taxes are a third higher than they should be normally . Then two weeks ago that medical 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 student came up here. He said we need to grin and bear it for the future. Future transits like him that come and go after a few years. Well, Mr. Medical man, we don't need transits. And we don't need immigrants . And we don't need refugees. We need taxpayers desperately . There's just not enough taxpayer s. And when you have examples like WNEP instead of being a good neighbor and paying their share, they go to court and -- this is going to happen by heaps and bounds pretty soon. The only people that are going to go down like Wayne Evans said are the ones that can afford a lawyer to oppose the new reassessment values. And again, I don't care what anybody 's saying, reassessment is just to raise taxes. It's what they're for. And they are going to skyrocket between paying for the reassessment and what are people like the ones in Nay Aug suppose d to do like when their values are down like my block. You still haven't told -- you haven't come up with any kind solution for that. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 David Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . Gee, I don't know if you caught it last week, but somebody was complaining about cat litter boxes in high schools or something . I was wondering , did you make sure those were changed , Mr. King, when you were supervisor ? Some of the stuff people read on the internet and take it hook, line, and sinker. It didn't only start with the more recent -- there was plenty of reports and fake pictures of 911 where jets were propelled into the building by robots and such. And it was just a reason to go to war in a little insignificant country . It's a shame. But, you know, when you're reading on the internet , just be careful because you do sound awful foolish . The lawsuit with our trash, once again, of course, it's landlord s that got themselves a break last year you could have up to four units and rent them out and have City haul trash. Instead of $1,200, they are paying $300. And more often than not, my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 experience with tenants is that they don't recycle or do anything to reduce the cost. So hopefully they are not in for big stormy waters over that. And I will mention again 18 percent of the County of Lackawanna property is tax exempt. And 12 percent of that exists in Scranton and that was a 2019 assessment review. So probably we have a great deal more. And we might be up to only 20 percent of the tax exempt properties . And they are exempt for various reasons and so forth. But there and again, you know, sometimes you scratch your head. My aunt's second marriage broke up. And I was talking to her one day. And the preacher in a church -- her husband was pretty out there. And the preacher in the church, the sermon was if a ping pong paddle don't work on your kids, use a baseball bat. Well, I don't know what your opinion is, but my opinion is a church like that does not need a tax exemption . They just don't need them, period. And more or less, we're being taken advantage of by the whole county and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 beyond because these institutions do a great deal of things other than hurt people in Scranton . I mean, that's all there is to it, courthouses , you name it. We have an artillery shell manufacturer that's entire -- that might be larger than a city block pays no taxes, even though they are a profit making private corporation brought in by the government to run the place. And once again, I'd like to mention with the hospital , it would be interesting if we ever have time to call somebody in from the hospital to see why all of this money is being lost. And I'm willing to bet that it has a great deal to do with Covid, people begging when they're on -- being placed on a ventilator for the vaccine . Well, you know, the nurse just told them or the attendant , that will only make you sicker now. It's too late. And they probably didn't make it. Thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Is there anyone else who would like to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 heard? MR. RAINES: Can I go? Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Derek Raines, Scranton resident , sorry I'm late. But there's no handicap parking anywhere near here. How many people who work here have ever been out in an electric wheelchair and thought to themselves , boy, where do we park at? There's no handicap parking anywhere . We had to park way down past the Blind Association , no handicap parking . The whole backyard all filled with stuff, totally ADA regulation that you have handicap accessible parking here and we don't. But that's just one of countless problems in this city. I'm going to preface what I'm going to say, I heard people talking about the paving and everything . So I looked on line. I couldn't find anything about is my block going to be fixed with my issue with the paving. I don't think it is because I can't find anything and nothing has been done. And then I heard a man here talking about, oh, I've had this problem for two years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 and the city fixed it. And I thought to myself, I've had my problem for 20 years, 20 years. It's been on the TV. It's been in the newspaper , nothing has ever been done. So how did he get his fixed in two years? Anybody have a clue how he got that done in two years? I have -- now my doctors told me I need to start getting out of the house. Dr. Jessica , I can't see if you're actually there. But I need to get out and get moving. I need to be able to drive my chair. I need to be able to drive down to the hospital . I need to be able to drive to my favorite restaurant . And I can't because this city has horrible , horrible sidewalks , horrible pave cuts. There's a big hole on my corner at the kids' bus stop. I've complained about that for at least two years, nothing is done. I had the head of DPW come out, said, oh, yeah, your whole road needs to be repaved. Well, I already knew that. That's been known for years, nothing 's been done. Can any of you tell me how I could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 get my area handicap accessible ? We heard people talking about the laws what we're suppose d to follow. The City doesn't follow those laws. They don't follow ADA. Why? Why not? Why can't I get my -- and I'm not yelling . It just seems that way. Why can't I get my simple problem fixed in front of my house? 20 years. Is there any kind of time limit? And that guy who complains , he gets his fixed in two years. The people on East Mountain , they got their stuff fixed. What do I have to do to get my block paved and make it so I could drive as a disabled person in my chair? What do I have to do? Can any of you tell me what needs to be done for me to get my problem rectified in this city? MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , wasn't Mr. Raines' street submitted down to DPW for -- MR. VOLDENBERG : It was, Mr. King, and they all met there in early March. MR. RAINES: Yes, they did. Everyone came out and we had a great visit and everybody agreed that needs to be paved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. KING: When is the list going to be released ? I know there's an OECD list and there's a city paving list? MR. RAINES: We're not on the OECD. MR. VOLDENBERG : I've reached out for the list. I haven't receive d it yet from DPW. OECD will not have a paving list this year. But they will have an ADA handicap curb cut program in place of the paving. I'm not sure when that will start. I'll find out. MR. KING: Is Mr. Raines -- is his corner there right by his house there, is that include d in that list, that ADA list; do you know? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll recommend that it is. I'm sure it will be. MR. RAINES: We talked about it numerous times. Why can't DPW do their job? You have a big hole on each corner. I said to the guy when he came to my house, I said, "Why don't I just go by a bag of Quikrete and fill up the hole?" And he said, "Oh, yeah, that's a good idea." Why don't we get that stuff done? I pay -- my wife and I pay $6,000 a year in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 property taxes for my house, $6,000. My wife and I, I'm retired. I have a good disability . My wife has a very good job. And we talk all the time should we just leave this city because the city is doing nothing for us. Can the city get away without our 100 plus thousand dollars of tax that my wife and I pay between our wage tax and our property tax? Is it okay for you guys if we just leave and turn our house into another rental property ? We don't need any more rental properties . We need to do stuff to get people to stay in their houses. And I'm sick of complaining about it. And I want somebody to tell me how I can get my problem fixed. Don't have to say I'm a disable d veteran , 20-plus years retired. And I can't get this city to fix my problem . It's not like it's the first time. Mark McAndrew , how many times have I talked to you about it, countless . MR. MCANDREW : Derek, I apologize . I'm being honest with you. I thought there was some action being taken with regards to the last -- like in March. I remember receiving 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 correspondence , everybody is coming out. Everybody is going to take care of it. Well, obviously they didn't and I apologize . Sometimes we think that followup occurs. Evidently it didn't. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I'm not going to wait until Fifth Order. All the e-mails and correspondence that I've had with -- and so have you with Mr. Raines, let's get this finished . And I think I said this in March. Now I'm saying it in -- there's no more excuses. It's inexcusable . So please send correspondence to -- we want this done, period. MR. KING: Mr. Raines, is it the corner of Ash and Monroe or the next one up? MR. RAINES: They're on both, the corner of Ash and the corner of Myrtle. They both have nonhandicap things that go through them. But the big thing is when it rains or anything , I get, 4, 5, 6 inches of water that sits in front of my driveway . And my wife will tell me you're not bringing that chair inside the house. You're going to have to do something else because she'll have to clean my chair to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 be able to go from the street up handicap ramp into my house. MR. KING: Okay. We will make that a priority . And we'll be able to hopefully respond by next week with an answer. MR. RAINES: Mr. McAndrew , have we heard that before? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, but -- well, you know, we sat here earlier in caucus, heard all the wonderful streetscapes and all the stuff we're going to do with, you know, this ARPA money, the almost 69 million dollars . And it's just unaccepta ble to me that you're not taken care of by now or your area or your street. And it's not just you. Someone else could get hurt there. It's not all about you and I get that. And we've had great conversation s. But at this point, it's beyond unacceptable . There's no excuses . We won't tolerate any more excuses tell them, Mr. Voldenberg . Thank you. MR. RAINES: Well, I'm greatly happy to hear that. But, Dr. Jessica , are you here? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I'm present .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MR. RAINES: You know more than anybody I need to get my bottom out and get moving. I sat in my house for three years. And I was told I need to get outside and start doing things. And I need to be able to do things. I need to be able to drive down my street. I don't mind riding in the middle of the road which I did here. We parked all the way down -- I can't remember how far away we had to park. But I would love to be able to go out and do something . And I'm an able-bodied disable d person. I feel so bad for the people who can't do anything . And the City really needs to step up to the plate and make disability access a priority for the city. MR. KING: We'll make that a priority , Mr. Raines. Thank you very much. MR. RAINES: Thank you to all of you. DR. ROTHCHILD : -- that you're on the list and that they get down there to pave your street. We'll make sure of it. MR. RAINES: Thank you. Did I hear 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 my wife behind me? Oh, I'm sorry. I could use the I'm blind excuse. Thank you all so much. MR. COYNE: Good evening , Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . While waiting here I had to drop off some paperwork earlier today. And I took the chance to take a -- just a little stroll around center city. One of the interesting things I found was right out back of the building here was Mr. Oleski's city car sitting back there. Well, city car, he's probably in here doing business . But it's very interesting in taking a look in it, just wandering around it. In the dashboard column are a set of keys for that very own car. I mean, nothing attracts someone to break in and steal anything more than the entire set of keys right on the console . But on top of that, there was money sitting there as well. And even though they weren't officially ones they shouldn 't drive with, you know, empty pill bottles on the front seat. I think that having three pill bottle prescription s, e-mails on where you're going to for inspection s visible and not in a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 folder and money and car keys in there, I understand that the building had an issue with a master key being left unsecured . I don't see how leaving keys in the middle of a console in the car sitting there publicly visible -- I didn't try the door. For all I know I could have hopped in there, open the door up and took off with the car. I think none of that should happen and none of that should be visible when you look in a city car that you see open pill bottles . What would happened with most people is the cops would pull them out for being possibly under -- driving under the influence if something happened . You don't bring pill bottles and lay them sprinkled all over your car. The impacted map that we saw up here for different areas, it's very interesting if you took a look at that impacted map. Did you notice that the entire University of Scranton is an impacted area? Did you notice the other impact areas, a small cutout called Geisinger is somehow an impacted area? I'm not sure how the Geisinger 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Hospital is considered on that map an impacted area. So I have questions about the accuracy of what an impacted area is on that map. We took a look and it said there was 52 million dollars -- 5.2 million dollars that were allocated in the flex fund. That means there's 4.8 million still unallocated . Maybe it's time to stop some of that allocation and say we need to pull some of it and redress it. We need to stop and put some of that towards the pool. But that takes fortitude . I took a look at the website . I think we have $170,000 extra in insurance that we pay because of the last cyber security breach of this building that I warned you about before it happened. We pay $170,000 a year extra insurance . When I took a look at it, I see it's (inaudible ) 6.2. The login that's used for building that page, it's admin. You never should have admin as a login on your system. Basically cyber security is the first thing you do is you make an admin account and you get rid of that name because it's a direct attack vector. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 You don't have your site announce what version of WordPress you're on, what plug-ins it has. None of that should be front facing. That is a complete security hole. Are you going to be taking over for Mayor when she goes on maternity leave? Because when she's on maternity leave, I believe the head of Council takes over as a Mayor. I think that's right before Christmas . Are you getting ready for that spot? MR. KING: I'm praying she's in and out. MR. COYNE: Well, that's inconvenient because we need her to have her time to take her time for maternity leave and she shouldn 't be double dipping . So you need to take that hat. Last, is the money that the City is considering floating a loan for. I think maybe we need to recall the 35,000 or whatever it is that we just gave the lawyer. If we're going to put through loans for the City, we need freezes on employee administrative pay until these loans are paid. There needs to be teeth because right now for all of the money that we have to pay in courts, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the people who are getting these refunds if it's done by a loan, are paying for the loans to pay themselves . And that is completely wrong. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. RINALDI : Good evening , Council , Dave Rinaldi , 212 Colfax. I have a couple of things. Number one, I wanted to read you this. I found this in some of my research on these large medical corporations like Geisinger . According to the Physician 's Advocacy Institute , 75 percent of physicians now work for hospitals , health systems , or corporate entities . So healthcare is a corporate business . That's one of the reasons why I believe that any negotiations the City has with Geisinger only have to do with money. It's a question of money. And the City should get as much as they can for the City as a whole and for the resident s in our neighborhood as is possible . And I hope you think about that when you're trying to decide. The other thing I wanted to talk about was I asked a question 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 last week. And it's important to me so I know the basis for my testimony at the public hearing next week on the 18th and that was whether or not the amendment which is Council File 54 of 2023 is for the current ordinance or for SAPA. SAPA being if it's approved , it will not take effect until the last municipality approves it. That's -- MR. KING: It falls under SAPA. MR. RINALDI : It is SAPA. MR. KING: Yes. MR. RINALDI : Okay. Thanks very much. I do appreciate that because that brings in a whole other community that has a say on this. But thank you very much. And I want to wish everyone -- everyone in the audience a happy holiday and a joyful time season. Thanks. MR. KING: Thanks, Attorney Rinaldi . MS. KOLOSKI : Good evening , Council . I wanted to find out is there any word on any of the studies that Mary Beth had brought up last week that they said they were going to check on the lighting study, the water study. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. KING: I don't believe any of those studies have been completed at this time. I believe that once an expansion of the hospital if it comes to that that they'll be require d to do certain studies associated with any expansion with that. But I will -- I will address that a little bit further in Fifth Order. MS. KOLOSKI : Okay, because I would like to understand myself how an informed decision is made to give a vote on something that they can then do whatever they want without studies being done first to see if it should be feasible . And I would like to suggest that if the hospital is negotiating with Council or telling Council what they plan to do, any of the important things like lighting or anything like that -- MR. KING: I'm going to address that in Fifth Order. MS. KOLOSKI : Okay, that you get it in writing so they can't back out and change their mind if you approve. Okay, that's -- that's on the hospital . That's about it for me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 on that. One of the things I wanted to write -- ask about was the benches for the bus. In a lot of big cities you see that there's shelters with a bench in it for people waiting for buses. And I don't know who would address that here in Scranton . But I'm only interested in the one on my corner of Colfax and Mulberry . The bus comes there and people wait that are coming in and out of the hospital . Basically they are the only people that take the bus on that corner. There's no residents taking the buses. It's always people coming from their appointments . Most of them are handicapped . They're standing there with canes. The lucky ones I guess I won't say they're really lucky, but the ones in the wheelchairs at least can sit down. They are standing there in the rain in the weather because -- across catty-corner from the hospital . I don't know whose responsibility it would be to put a bench or a shelter . I know I often had to -- invited people to come sit on my porch that I don't know to get out of the weather . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 You know, actually I gave somebody money in a wheelchair to take an Uber or a cab down to the bus station because Geisinger had given them the wrong bus schedule and the bus wasn't going to be there for another hour or so. So, I mean, something like that should be addressed in an area like that because that's really the only reason that the bus has to stop there anymore is for the patients . And there really should be something for them like a decent bench with some shelter over it. And I don't know if that's the City's responsibility , the bus company 's responsibility or the hospital 's responsibility . But I'd like to see something done for the people. Thank you. MR. KING: We'll look into that, Mrs. Koloski . I'm not sure if that's the county, Colts, if it's the City, a combination of -- MS. KOLOSKI : Well, I'm not sure either. I figured I'd bring it up here because it's really very unfair to the people when it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 raining , when it's snowing , the people in the wheelchairs are sitting in the road because there's -- they can't wait in the hospital lobby or they're going to miss the bus. I mean, I have a ramp. So I say if you want to come up and sit on my porch but I don't really like inviting strangers on my porch either. But, you know, you got to do some. Something has to be done. It's really not right. I don't know whose responsibility . And speaking of handicapped , this is nowhere near the issue that this other poor man has with the street; but they still have not done anything about cutting down those curbs. MR. KING: I'll be address ing that in Fifth Order as well. MS. KOLOSKI : Okay. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. KOLOSKI : Have a good night. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to Colts and the County to inquire about that and even the city administration to try to get some answers as to who would be responsible and how it's determined where they would be located ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to Colts in the morning , sir. MR. KING: Thank you very much. MS. WILLIAMS : Joe Ann William s, Scranton resident . I'm here also again to talk about Geisinger . What's going on up there now I have a home. I own property at 220 Colfax is the houses that they tore down, the land they're putting hay on, probably going to grow grass. You wouldn't believe the noise that went on while they were doing that. And I could only imagine when they start building the pollution and noise that there's going to be and dirt that you've already had. Also, our property values like I told you before have come down. The 300 block of Colfax, forget about it because you can't -- during the day you can't get through there. I mean, they're really taking a beautiful neighborhood and ruined it. They don't even want to reach out, you know, to talk or discuss things and that's the way it is. But anyway, you know, I hope when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 you're voting next week, I'm glad you made this gentleman a priority . You need to make the taxpayers a priority , the people who live in this city. My grandparent s bought that home in 1933. You need to make us a priority and the children , not these corporations , what's best for us. We lived here all of our lives. We hope our children stay and continue to live in the City of Scranton . Now, going to the priority of children , let's talk about Nay Aug Park. We need a pool up there. Splash pad is fine. But what elderly people want to go on a splash pad if they want to go for a swim? Have you seen the playgrounds lately? I mean, the park is beautiful . I compliment the volunteers that have done work up there and the trees being planted, you know, in memory of deceased people. But the area across from the zoo down Mayor Doherty got a bunch of volunteers . And we resurrect ed a playground down there. It's deplorable now. There is no place for children to go to that park and swing on a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 swing. You can't just have one little set of swings. It's a huge park to play up there. And now you're not going to put a pool? And how long is that going to take to get this done? This Mayor, you know, really. I know she doesn't want a pool. I don't even think she lives in the City of Scranton , okay. We have to start thinking about the people that have lived here, the people that pay taxes, people pay high rents and mostly the children . I hope you all remember that. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Williams . MR. NORTON: Hi, folks, Ken Norton, Scranton . I got a couple things. I happened to be up at Keyser Valley Community Center over the weekend and the parking lot area is below the curbing of the road. So all the water seems to be backing up in the parking lot. And it seems as though it's done some damage to the building . The blocks are cracked and everything of the sort. Now, right next door to the parking lot is also a lot, an overgrown lot. I don't know if it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 belongs to the community center or whoever it is. But if it's possible that it could get cleaned up and be used for additional parking , you know. And really it just does need to be cleaned up. That's for that. The other thing is, down towards Memorial Stadium , you do have lighting . But in the evening , especially in the fall when the games are going on and everything , with the oncoming traffic it's very difficult to see the kids or adults when they're walking across the street. So I was wondering if you could go ahead and get more of a shadow kind of like that would at least reflect the individual that is walking out, you know. And that would be number two. Number three, I understand you have a new internet company that's running basically fiber through the city on the poles and such. That goes ahead and leads to another thing. You have I'm assuming ten zoning officers because they just got ten new electric vehicles . Now, according to the PUC, okay, it is up to the city or the municipality to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 ahead and turn in poles that haven't been changed over so they could go ahead and technically find them. Will they do it, no. The way it's worded is reasonable amount of time, okay. But you have a tremendous amount of poles in this city that have not been transferred over. And really to the individual in the handicap , you are taking away from access because basically they got to put them on the sidewalks , you know. So instead of having one pole you may have two. If you go down Green Ridge Street, you could go ahead and see that there's three poles that are stacked together , you know. But anyways, it seems to be somebody is going to have to go ahead and just call out the companies to go ahead and change over their stuff which is basically the zoning officers . Final thing which, okay, I'm going to go with number four here. Downed lines, you have an awful lot of communication lines that are laying around, you know, they're cut down. They're tied to poles and everything like that. Once upon a time that used to be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 real big no-no because the power company always responded to wires down because of the fact it may be a power wire. But now it is basically accepted to leave wires laying all over place. And there is a slight possibility that in the future someone may get hurt because the average Joe really doesn't know the difference between a cable TV wire and a power wire. So I'm just bringing that up where it pretty much goes back to the City to try to go ahead and hold everybody accountable . That's it. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Norton. Miss Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I guess I'll start off since we're talking about handicap ped people. I think most of you know that I spent a good number of years pushing one and you learn a lot, which is get on macadam , don't go on gravel paths, which they used to have at Nay Aug. I don't think they still do. But the biggest one is I don't think a penny should be paid for anything down here in town until the streets are able to -- drains 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 are able to take the stormwater and put it down where it's suppose d to go. Many times when I'm over down here you had to go out in -- because the curbs was, you know, get wet. So you have to go down half a block to -- and then you have to go up over the curb. So those aren't cutout areas either. So I think that should be number one in our walkability . Moving on, last week, Mr. King, you told us there would be -- the fire contract would be available tonight and the police would be April and I missed the date that was -- MR. KING: I believe on the police go to arbitration the final week -- the last week of April. And the fire is posted on the city website . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Good. Thank you. Is there anything that could be done to help ECTV get the speaker that's needed for back there as they had? MR. KING: I believe that's been ordered , Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : It has been received , Mr. King. And it may be up by next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 meeting . MS. SCHUMACHER : Hooray. Thank you. That's good news. You should have announce d that yourself. Now, is there anything new that would add to the nine -- the tax exempt properties that are contributing with payments in lieu of taxes? Has anything increase d that nine? MR. KING: Other than right now -- right now that Attorney Cutillo is preparing an RFP to have a HUP test performed for -- I think there is 1,601 properties that are identified as nonprofit . So they are going to put an RFP -- they're going to put out an RFP shortly and they they're going to apply this HUP test to various nonprofits that may have qualified , I don't know, 10, 15, 20 years ago but maybe things have changed over the last several years to test to see if they still qualify . And if they don't, they have to go back on tax rolls -- MS. SCHUMACHER : And you just said something that's very important is reviewing them periodically . And I brought that up at the county meeting s too. That should happen -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 I don't know if you could put it into the code with just you guys voting on it or if that's a state thing or not. But I think that's certainly worth looking into. Let me see. Well, I would like to say also that I'm happy to see the trash settlement finally . That was good. Now there was -- in 3-B on tonight -- in tonight 's -- it said that they cannot proceed with entry level police examinations until the Mayor -- they get some kind of confirmation from the Mayor. Has that happened ? MR. KING: Yeah, it indicate s that the contract 's been signed. The police chief has a copy of the contract . The Commission is awaiting confirmation from the Mayor's office to proceed with entry level police examinations . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, I know that. That's why I was asking. Has that happened ? Who's following up on that to make sure that we -- that they could get going on that? MR. KING: Apparently it hasn't happened yet. If it has, I'm not aware of it. Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask the administration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 for an update on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUSTER : And then -- I'm sorry, I'm going to do one more because of the timing. But on 3-C, on the payroll property tax, I think I found it confusing and I didn't bring it with me. It was something -- how much was collected in a month. And then it said what year to date. And they didn't -- there was quite a difference there. So I don't know how that happened . MR. KING: I think it's broken up into quarters . And I believe that it started if I'm correct April 1 of last year. So the fourth quarter would have just ended in end of March or would that have been the end of February -- the end of March. So it's broken down into the four quarters . And they're all -- it was 406,000 the first quarter ; 402,000 the second quarter ; 418,000 the third quarter ; and 434,000 the fourth quarter . There's other dollar amounts but I'm rounding . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, but once in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 month. But I'll bring it back next week if I don't have anything other than that. Thank you very much. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . MS. O'MALLEY: Good evening , Barbara O'Malley, Wheeler Avenue, Scranton . On May 4th, the City of Scranton will join cities across the country celebrating Jane Jacobs 107th birthday . Jane who was born in Scranton is best known for her ground-breaking book the Life and Death of Great American Cities, which changed the course of urban planning and for her -- also for her community activism . Jane was a graduate of Central High School. She worked at the Scranton Tribune before making her way to New York City. It was there that she rose to prominence as a neighborhood activist. The film Citizen Jane tells the story of the successful David and Goliath fight to save her Greenwich Village neighborhood from a bulldozer. In 2021 at an observe d Scranton event, Mayor Cognetti lauded Jane as a native Scranton ian who embodied the spirit of Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 which she described as the community looking out for one another . She attributed Jane's upbringing in Scranton to her activism and to her efforts to protect her neighborhood to make sure it didn't get in the Mayor's words cut up. We too, the Hill Section resident s and park neighbors are driven by that same Scranton spirit. We don't want our neighborhood to get cut up either by zoning designations that would permit hundred foot structures across the street from homes completely overshadowing and isolating them from the rest of the neighborhood . Yet, we are portrayed as obstructionist against expanded healthcare services . This is simply not true. What we are against is our neighborhood being treated as expendable by our elected officials . It has been suggested that the resident s of the neighborhood should get over it and face the fact that they live in a hospital zone. But the same thing could be said about Geisinger . Perhaps they should face the fact that they moved into an existing city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 neighborhood decades ago. The door swings both ways. Mayor Cognetti also spoke of the great responsibility elected officials have to keep the principles of Jane Jacobs alive in our city. One of Jane's rock solid principles is bottoms up planning , which relies on the wisdom of the people who live in the affected area for input. Jane disdained top down planning which is imposed upon residents by politicians , consultant s, planner s and special interest . As you have heard from the testimony of our group, there has been a lack of credible information from Geisinger and stonewalling about the actual plans. Yet, it also appears that some information and access is being parcelled out to select individuals and elected officials which gives the impression of political gamesmanship. On May 4th a flag will be raised at City Hall to celebrate Jane Jacob's Day in Scranton . But now is the time for City Council to raise a flag on behalf of the people who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 live in the affected neighborhood . Amend the propose d zoning in the blocks surround ing the hospital to cap structures at 45 feet, a liveable scale and a workable compromise . This will demonstrate that Scranton has truly embraced the ideals of Jane Jacobs, not just the idea of her native celebrity . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss O'Malley. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. LITTLE: Hi, I'm Rick Little from Scranton . I tried to go to Bob Casey's office today. And they told me he hasn't been there for three years. So I don't know what to do about that because my problem is federal . And I'm trying to navigate my home. I'm just trying to stay alive for my daughter who was parentally alienated from me. I haven't seen her since she was eight. She's 22 now. And I have to stay living where I am because that's the last address that she had. And I'm too old to move. And yet, I'm seeing after going and dealing with New York State Family Court System, they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 are just out to destroy the family. And the Court are a business . I learned that very well. I testified at the Moreland Commission in front of Loretta Lynch of all people back in 2013. I ended up here in Lackawanna County besides a person who is suppose d to be given a basic living thing is approximately $850. But almost immediately I got the Department of Taxation in New York State under the guise of helping the children , you know. They -- $5,000 child support arrears where they took my Social Security from -- out from under me in Queens, New York. And I go to Matt Cartwright 's office over and over and, you know, so I'm living in -- just trying to get by. And I talked to my landlord . But they have a thing called recertification . I live in Scranton Housing Authority and I've been trying for years to figure out who they are. Their lawyer, David Coyne who is also a district attorney , outright refuses to tell me the first and last names of the people that work there. Yet they prosecute me all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 time by saying they have a right to just burst into my room. They burst into my room about 100 times. They flooded my apartment twice. once -- I mean, they put the maniac above me. He floods my apartment . It destroys $3,000 worth of Family Court transcript s which is key to taking my child away from me because of the process of the Court. And when she turned 18 that was the end of it. Anyway, now they keep trying to evict me. There is a big problem here because I have to witness all of these people dying in my building , watching people's stuff being stolen in my building . They confiscated my stuff. They have my stuff confiscated because they put it in charge of this ever-changing building manager who at the whim they would unlock the door. And I call security . Who's working at security ? It's Pat O'Malley, you know, $53,000 security job. And I ask him, I don't know who to talk to. They are suppose d to talk to me. Under 2024 CFR, the federal rules they should 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 not be able to do this. In my lease it is written that all the county and city and state amenities are suppose d to be unbiasedly handled by my landlord and yet it is not. They have the magistrate judge right in their pocket. And they take me and they've taken hundreds of other people and people become homeless . Fortunately , I learned how to protect myself last time. And I just barely managed to get the appeal in. And now they've just evicted me. And I just got the appeal in yesterday . I'm trying to move it to federal court. But there's a big problem with Scranton Housing Authority and the County of Lackawanna , Department of Aging, the Lackawanna Pro Bono colluding to make old people and disabled people homeless . And I hope Scranton could help me because I've done right to knows and I'm up to my neck and it's tough. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: I do have a few things. I respond ed to a call to look at Connell Park. They said a dangerous situation around the play areas. I found that the mulch up there had been worn away or is pretty much gone, anywhere from 6 inches to about 18 inches down in all of the play areas up there around all the play equipment . I took pictures of it all. And while I was there neighbors came across and they advised me that on Friday a child had fell there and struck her head. I won't give their name, but I sent the pictures to Mr. Voldenberg request that he forward it to Parks and Rec which I believe now Mr. West is handling that. And also, while I was there a group of neighbors also offered to come over and help pull the weeds, put the ground cover down and spread the mulch. I don't know if that would be allowed. Mr. Voldenberg , if we could find that out? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 MR. SMURL: And on the corner of Prospect Avenue and Elm Street there's construction on the street. I believe they're putting water main and gas mains in. But on this corner, I believe the city took down an abandon ed building or a building that was on the condemn ed list and the demo list for a long time. The construction equipment is parked there, solar materials stored there, pipe, backfill and other things. I don't know where they got the permission to park there but the corner is filthy. The rest of the corners are clean. But I also took pictures of the surrounding corners in that area. I took picture s of the equipment with the names on it to whom it belongs to. So I forward ed that to Mr. Voldenberg . And if you would send that to I believe Director Oleski and find out who is going to clean the area. I hope they are using the equipment or they're storing the equipment and material that they would clean the place up. And before they leave it that they will level it back out the way they found it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 and at the minimum plant grass to make it at least present able again. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. And our first community cleanup that we're going to have is Sunday, this Sunday the 16th at 9 a.m. It starts at 886 North Main Avenue. And we're going to do that entire field all the way down to the entrance to the expressway . So, Mr. Voldenberg , will you ask Director Pietreface if he will send a truck there on Monday morning to pick up all the trash and whatever else we could put up there so it's not scattered throughout the street. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. And that's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Two things. Both are followups. It was mentioned in public comment tonight about the utility poles. I know, Mr. Voldenberg , you and I both had a conversation that started with Don King. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Can we just send over some correspondence to him to continue that about the double utilities poles or the utilities companies taking out the poles once the power gets transfer red over to the new pole? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, sir. They did compile a list along with PP&L a few months ago. I'll get a status. MR. SCHUSTER : The other thing is, could we reach out to Mr. West and the BA's office and ask if we have any bids or RFPs put out for any of the work on our FEMA project s? He was in a short time ago. They did get an extension out to December from the 2018 storm and flooding that we had. And those projects -- I'd like to see that they have been started . Could we just see if we put any of those out to bid or started any of those projects ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a few things. So first off I received an e-mail there were concern s that I brought forward a few weeks ago about Reese Street in North Scranton . And one of the things I believe we had requested was a traffic study to take place on Reeves Street because of a few different issues but one of them being people entering the one way pretty often. So someone had actually sent me a video of someone driving the wrong way on the one way part of Reese Street. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could check to see if that traffic study request was made or the status of it. But they would also like to see if new signs are appropriate , new signs for do not enter so that it's more obvious to drivers that they should not be driving that way on the street. And I know Mr. Raines had come in earlier to bring up his concerns about his street and just handicap accessibility in general throughout the city and that's very important to me to address and I had previously requested at least for City Hall what areas we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 could make changes and improvement s in so that we could become more ADA accessible . And I never receive d a response that I'm aware of. So if we could please make that request again. I also would like an update from DPW on the handicap signs that we requested for downtown . I know that there was a delay because of the issues with the sign maker but now that we have the new sign maker, I want to make sure that that's prioritize d that those signs are -- are made and placed downtown . And I also never received anything from the Scranton Police regarding I had questions on the amount of tickets for people parking in those handicap only spots downtown , which people are frequent ly parking in without having -- without having the proper tag for it. So if we could once again ask the Scranton Police for that information . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I don't have any motions . But I have a comment . So tonight Doris came forth. And I always say that, you know, sometimes the best ideas come from the residents . They're our eyes and ears on Council . So you've been coming here for months. And all you've wanted was just a reasonable height restriction on the parking garage, reasonable , right? And tonight you demonstrated to me what a good neighbor really is because you voice your concerns about Geisinger 's patients who have to stand out in the weather waiting for a bus. So that's a sign of a good neighbor . Even though you want something reasonable and, of course, I agree with you. But you showing concern for the patients of the entity that you're, you know, you're having a little problem with, I'm impressed and very proud. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . So just a followup from the previous week. I know Marie Schumacher had mentioned 842 Moosic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 Street. We notified code enforce ment. And they will advise Council as to their finding s at 842. I think that there was some garbage piled up there in front of 842. The 1500 block of Birch Street, we notified DPW. And we're waiting for a response on that. The Meadow Brook flood project easements , the City Law Department is to advise on the status and number of easement s outstanding as it relates to this project . Doris mentioned the curb cuts at Gibson and Colfax and Olive and Colfax Avenue. We notified DPW. And we will -- they will advise Council . Council office was advised that OECD will have a project in the 2023 for ADA compliant curb cut update. So I think that was mentioned earlier as well. Mr. Les Spindler , we talked about the Family Dollar store at Linden Street and North Main Avenue last week. Scranton Police Department traffic officer Rich Iannuzo is to meet with the city engineer , Reilly Associates at that location for next steps and will advise Council on that issue and the 1300 block of Brook Street about a large pave cut and they're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 going to get back to us on that. Joan Hodowanitz , we contact ed the Single Tax Office and were advised that action is under review by the STO solicitor with your question . Also, it was mentioned earlier this evening that we don't need immigrant s. We need taxpayers . Well, you know, who says that immigrants aren't taxpayers , first of all. And second of all, I think we're all immigrants . And to me, that's just unacceptable . I think immigrant s make this community great. And I'll continue to say that and I think diversity makes our city great. So to make a statement like that is -- to me is just unacceptable . So I'm going call it out every time it's mention ed. And I'm calling it out again tonight . I do want to announce that a notice is going to go out tomorrow that Scranton City Council will hold a special public caucus here in City Council Chambers on Tuesday , April 18th beginning at 5 p.m. The purpose of this caucus will be to discuss the Geisinger expansion project as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 it relates to the proposed 2023 zoning ordinance . And Geisinger representa tives will be here for that caucus at five. The public is welcome to attend. All public comment will be reserved for the schedule d public hearing to follow the caucus. So Council has never formally had the opportunity to meet with Geisinger . So we're going to bring them into caucus. And we're going to have them do a little presentation . And then we'll have some question s for them and many of which will be based on things that have been brought up in these chambers . And it's important to note too that there will be no vote that evening on the zoning ordinance . The vote at this time is expected the following week April 25th. And that's all I have at this time.

ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I mean, this is very important . I mean, I remember growing up where led poisoning was -- happened a lot because kids were eating paint chips. And I'm sure that they still remain in some of these houses because there's a lot of still older houses around. But I read through this legislation . I'm not against it, but I don't know how the houses will be identified for this high risk property assessment . It doesn't state it anywhere in there. And I don't know what happens after that, what the remediation is, what does it look like, who is going to help these resident s that have a child six years or under. Of course, I'll move it forward ; but I do have questions . And is this voluntary or how do they identify these homes? MR. KING: Perhaps , Mr. Voldenberg , can you forward those questions to the administration for -- if they have those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 answers by next week?

MR. KING: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? On the question , one concern I know -- I'm not sure if everybody received this e-mail. I got an e-mail from an individual . One of my concerns is that we're going to accept these funds and a big part of it is that they're open to the public after school. Yet, they updated recently Prescott Elementary School and that playground is locked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 at I think 3:30 or and 4:00 every day and the public has no access. If we're going to accept this grant, utilize this funding , we need to make sure that the Scranton School District is going to allow accessibility at I think it's John F. Kennedy Elementary School to ensure that the public has access to that area after hours. So I'm just hoping that we get cooperation from the school district and they realize the benefits of this funding . Part of it is I know when I was the Superintendent of Lakeland , we had two grants to help redo the rubberized track up at Lakeland . And a big part of that was, one was a Keystone Opportunity Grant and the other one was a Greenways and Trails Grant. I mean, part of that was it had to be open to the community after hours after the students were done with track practice or football practice or what have you. It needed to be available to the public. And I believe that's what this grant is indicating . So I'm hoping through our committees , you know, the multiservice 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 committee s or what's the word I'm looking for? MR. MCANDREW : Shared services . MR. KING: Shared Service s Committee that we could work with the Scranton School District to ensure that the public is going to be able to utilize this and quite frankly , children after school hours to be able to enjoy this. Having said that I am voting in the affirmative for that -- for this tonight . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree with Councilman King. That was what I thought was the initial intent with the Prescott playground. And I'm a block away from it. I would love for my daughter to be able to use it before she's actually a student at Prescott . So, yeah, I would be hopeful for this grant as well that it would be open to -- to the community outside of school hours. MR. KING: And if it's not, it sounds like we're going to be in violation of this grant. MR. MCANDREW : Also, has any communication -- has there been any communication with the district as to who and, you know, of course, it would be someone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 certified with background checks. But who's going to be part of that process ? MR. KING: It says it's in partnership with Valley in Motion and the Scranton School District . So they are obviously aware. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. MR. KING: So I'm just hoping that we follow through with that and it is, in fact, open to the public after school hours. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes.
