AsaRepublican representative Fred Keller saidofHB-504thisplanwilldeliver onlytemporary short-termproperty tax relief.TheplanthatIsupport will provide upto80percent school property tax relief toScranton residents ,andIalso wanttoseemorerelief forrenters.The valueofthegovernor 'sapproach isthatit wasnotoffered inavacuum assomeone said thelegislation citedbyMr.Evanswas. Ilookfortherecord toworking withmycolleagues tocomeupwithreal solutions totheissues thatarefacing our localresidents ,butIamnotgotopush another baitandswitch shellgameas Mr.Evans'suggestion woulddo.Ifany council member haveanyideasorsuggestions forthecitythatyouthinkImaybeableto assist with,mydoorhasandwillalways be open.Inthisparticular instance Ihaveto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 disagree withCouncilman Evans,unless you areamajorcorporation ormember ofthe timber industry thisisataxhikenottax relief."

Inanother matter,Iknowthatwe allfeelthatthereshould bereformstohow nonprofits arehandled within thecity,but Iwouldliketocongratulate theUniversity ofScranton asitnearsthecompletion of thenewcenter forrehabilitation education . Itwillhaveabeneficial impact onthe city.Basedonconstruction andengineer expenses itincludes anoutputofeconomic activity of$87.7million ,laborincome of $36.1million ,valueaddedof$44.5million , $6.6million infederal taxesandan estimated $3.1million instateandlocal taxes.Itcreated 322jobsin2013,657 jobsin2014,and5,004jobsin2015. AsIsaid,thisdoesn'tchange the factthatwedoneedsomereform in nonprofits ,buttheUniversity andtheother nonprofits domakeamajorinvestment inthe cityandIdoappreciate whattheydo. Therewasgoodnewsfromthecounty1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 thisweekthattheyaregoingtointroduce thelandbanklegislation .Isupport their ideaandwanttoseetheparticular s.I wouldwanttoseehowitaffects Scranton sincewehavethemostaffected properties . Idoknowthatwithout thecommitment and leadership ofScranton CityCouncil , especially Councilman Gaughan ,thatthisnew legislation wouldnothavebeenintroduced . Infollow-uptowhatwediscussed at thePennDOT caucus Ihaveanupdate onthe DoughBoy,theDoughBoystatute isstillin storage attheSteamtown National Park. Aftercontacting PennDOT ,Ihavebeen informed because federal fundsarebeing usedforthisproject nofundscanbespent forrepair ofthestatute .Ihavebeenin touchwithSenator BlakeandRepresentatives Farina andFlynnconcerning otherfunding sources .Ihavealsoinvestigated what fundsthecitymaybeabletooffer.I've discovered thatthecitywaspaid$28,400 fortheright-of-wayatDuffyPark.That moneywasdeposited inthegeneral fundand wasusedforpaving.Iwashoping thatthat1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 moneymighthavebeenavailable forthe refurbish mentofthestatute ,butit'sgone. Westillhaveafewmonths before it becomes critical tohavearesolution before thenewDuffyParkopensin2017,butasI mentioned tonight inthecaucus,thedollar values thatarebeingthrown around with thisbridge Ihavetobelieve thatsomewhere inthefunding therehastobe$50,000to restore thispartofourhistory ,especially forthepeople ofSouthSide.PennDOT has beentrying todothat,butIwouldliketo havethemconcentrate moreonfinding some fundsforthatproject .That'sallIhave tonight .Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Rogan? MR.ROGAN:Yes,anumber ofitems andIwilladdress eachofthembriefly . Regarding theTimesarticle withthehiring procedures onthefrontpage,Idowantto doalittle research intothismatter. Whileit's,youknow,certainly isanissue thatneedstobeaddressed ,Idon'tbelieve thisisanything newinthecity.Sowhat I'mgoingtodoisI'mgoingtolookback1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 maybeoverthelasttenyearsandseehow manyjobshavebeengivenoutthathaven't beenhired.Ibelieve it'salongstanding practice inthecity,obviously thatdoesn't makeitcorrect ,butIwouldliketogoback andseethenamesoftheindividuals who werehiredwithout beingadvertised and compare thattothecampaign finance reports andseeiftheTimesisjusttaking an interest inthisnowbecause Ithinkyou willseeverysimilar situation sthathave takenplaceovertheprevious decades . Next,regarding therental registration ,Councilman Evansandmyself havebeenhoping forquiteawhile toget thisordinance reformed andthelegislation that--theemergency legislation wehaveto voteontonight isjustanother reason why thosechanges needtobemade.Ifirmly believe therental registration ordinance needstobeoverhauled ,thefeeneedstobe reducedanditneedstobemoremanageable forlandlordsandrentersinthiscity. Ibelieve additional exceptions should beaddedforfamily members granted1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 toanother family,immediate family,maybea grandfather tograndchildtypeof arrangement .Wedon'twanttogetinto thirdandfourth cousins orI'msurenobody wouldbepaying thefee. SoIthinkthat'ssomething that definitely needstobechanged andchanged quickly .Ihopethatwiththisordinance thatwassentdownfromthejudgethatit willgettomoveonthispretty quickly . RegardingCouncilman Wechsler mentioned regarding theUniversity of Scranton project ,andIknowoneofthe speakers brought itupaswellsaying we didn'tgetanything outofit,Iamproudto havevotedtoadvance thatproject along withCouncilman McGoff andformer Councilman FrankJoyce.WhileIagreethatnonprofit reform needstohappens,itneedstohappen fast.Ifnonprofits inthecitywantto teardownsmaller buildings andbuildbigger buildings onthesamefootprint that's something weshould certainly encourage because itdoescreate jobsandspur economic development without additional land1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 beingtakenoffthetaxrolls,soforthe nonprofit --allofthenonprofits inthe cityiftheywanttoexpand upwards Ithink that'saverygoodthingforeveryone .When itcomestononprofits purchasing additional properties andtaking themoffthetaxrolls that'swherewegetintosomeotherissues. Regardingtheauditlegislation ,I didspeakwithCouncilman EvansandIknow hewasworking withthebusiness administrator onamendments tothis legislation .Iagreewholeheartedly with theamendment thatCouncilman Evanscameup withtoreduce thetermfromfouryearsto twoyears.Obviously ,something needstobe doneregarding theauditintheCityof Scranton .Itisunacceptable thatforevery Ihavesatoncouncil ,andI'minmyfifth year,theaudithasbeenchronically late. Theauditisaveryimportant document that thecityneedstohavepriortoproducing budgets andproducing budgets without an auditcertainly hasn'tworked.Wehaveseen results ofthatoveranumber ofyears.I amhopeful thatwiththisfirmthatwill1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 tighten things upwhilethestaffinthe Business Administrator 'sOfficecanbe trained inaonesizefitsallplantohave anauditdoneinatimely manner.Notlike inthepastwhereoneperson wastheaudit person andnobody elseknewwhatwasgoing on.Itneedstobeinterchangeable .When oneaperson leaves theposition somebody elseneedstoknowtheexactroletobeable totaketostepinanddothoseduties.If twoyearsisn'tenough forstaffinginthe Business Administrator 'soffice tobe trained andso-called takethetraining wheels offatthatpointintimeweshould looktomaybecutbackresponsibility from theBusiness Administrator 'sOfficeandhave itdoneexclusively bytheprivate sector. SoIwillbesupporting Councilman Evans' amendment andthefinalbilltostraighten outouraudit. And,finally ,Iwouldliketothank CountyCommissioner ,Igenerally disagree withhim,Mr.Wansack andMr.O'Malley,who Igenerally doagreewith,ontheirpushing forthelandbank.Iwouldalsoliketo1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 thankthemayorwhocampaigned onthis,and Councilman Gaughan ,whofaultforitas well,butIdoagreewithcomments thatwere madeinthepaperbymycolleague regarding cityrepresentation onthelandbank.Land bankisgreatidea,butthevastmajority of theproperties thatwillbeinthisland bankwillbeintheCityofScranton andthe CityofScranton needstohaveproportionate represent ationonthatboard,justnotone seat.Weshould haveamajority ofthe seatsoratleast,youknow,maybeoneless, we'relooking atasevenmember body,the cityshould haveatleastthree,because it affects theresidents ofScranton muchmore thanitwouldaffectresidents inanarea thatdoesn'thavetheblight problems the CityofScranton does. Sothatisallfornow,Imayhave someadditional comments onagenda items. Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Evans. MR.EVANS:Thankyou.I'mvery happythatthecounty commissioners finally tookaction inthebeginning stepsofthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 formation ofalandbankthatoccurred .I'm hopeful ,likeallofusuphere,thatwecan workoutthelogistics ofadequate represent ationfortheCityofScranton and theproposed authority andwillmovethis process forward . OntheHarrison Avenuebridge,the oldHarrison Avenuebridge,I'm disappointed ,butifwasn'tunexpected that PennDOT wouldnotgoalongwiththatidea, andforlegitimate reasons ,Iunderstand that,butwiththatsaidI'mstill encouraged thatthecitycouncil continues tosearch outnewideasandisshowing a willingness tothinkoutside oftheboxin aneffort toinclude thequality oflifefor allofourcitizens . Tonight Iwouldliketotalkabout economic development forachange.The Lehigh Valley,according tosomeexperts , hasthefastest growing economy in Pennsylvania ,andhowdidthathappen asthe Lackawanna valley inScranton continue sto struggle through theremnants ofrecession . Inmanyways,thisrenaissance started in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 Allentown in2009whenStateSenator Pat Brownwrotelegislation forwhatisknownas aneighborhood improvement zone,alsoknown asaNIZ.Inthelegislation ,itonlysays thatafirstclasscitywithapopulation of between 106,000and107,000togetaNIZ. Thegenius ofthislegislation bySenator Brownisthattheonlycitythatcould possibly meetthisdefinition wastheCity ofAllentown ,hisowndistrict .Therefore , afterthelegislation approved theBill-- thelegislature approved theBill,Allentown became theoneandonlycitywithaNIZin theStateofPennsylvania .Thisis interesting because wehavebeentoldfor decades thatpassing legislation forthe CityofScranton wasthemainreason for remaining aClass2Abecause anylegislation passed wouldonlyeffect Scranton .Of course,wedon'thaveaNIZandyouwill havetodrawyourownconclusion astowhy not. SowhatisaNIZ?TheNIZallows developers incertain partsofAllentown to usestateandlocaltaxdollars toconstruct1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 andrehabilitate buildings .Thesetax dollars arepaidbythebusinesses thatmove intothedeveloper 'sknewbuildings.Within aNIZdevelop erscanalsousestateand localtaxdollars wheretheycanbuild, rehabilitate andexpand newones.Thezone isnotlarge,it'sbrokenupinafew pieces.Oneisafive-blockareain Allentown 'sdowntown andtheotherpieceis inAllentown 'swaterfront ontheLehigh river. Whataresomeoftheresults ofthe impact oftheNIZ?Inthecenter cityarea National BankPennBankShareswillbethe primary occupant andnew11storybuilding with272,000square feetofoffice space. Lehigh Valley Health Network willleadtoa sevenfloor,186,000square footbuilding within theNIZandbringing its500 employees withthem. Another project thatoccurred because oftheNIZwerethe$200million arenacalled thePPLcenter,hometothe Philadelphia Flyersminorleague hockey team.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 Additionally ,inarecent news article fromtheLehigh Valley business dot comsitethe$305million waterfront development isexpectedtobegininJuly whichwillinclude newoffice buildings ,433 upscaleapartments ,twoparking structures for2,200carsallalongtheriver.Itis estimated thatwithjustwhatispresently proposed fortheNIZareaofAllentown there willbeanestimated $1.3billion in development ,yes,thatisabillion witha "B".Themainreason thatitworksinstead ofkeeping thattaxmoney,thegovernment is itgiving todevelopers sotheycanpayoff theirdebtbecause thosedevelopers are saving alotofmoneytheycanputmore businesses inthedowntown intheNIZby offering lowerrentsinbuildings andother areas. Whatismostinteresting ,mostof thetaxrevenue iscoming fromthestate coffers .Moststateandlocaltaxespaidin thezone,including taxesonpersonal incorporating ataxcigarettes ,malt beverage andliquor andsalesof1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 construction materials gothedeveloper to payoffdebt.97percent ofthismoneyis statetaxrevenue ,notlocaltaxrevenue . Property taxescannot beusedandcontinue togotothecities inthecounty.That meansthestate,farmorethanthecity,is subsidizing Allentown 'srevitalization . Sincethenthestatehasadopted a similar programcalled aCommunity Reinvestment Revitalization andImprovement ZoneorKRRIZ.Thisprogram isverysimilar totheNIZandsimply tiesonsome requirements forthedevelopers .Whileit became available in2013,toapplyfora KRRIZyoumustbeacitywithapopulation ofover30,000,beathirdclasscityandbe engaged intheAct47process .Theonly cities currently enrolled tobeeligible are Bethlehem andLancaster .Therearesome otherrequirements ,butessentially Scranton onceagainwasnoteligible . Again,herewesitasacity,the onlyclass2Acityindistressed status for decades andweareontheoutsidelooking in.Weshould betheposter childfor1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 programs liketheonesIdescribed . Harrisburg hasbeenbigonAllentown andis paying hugedividends ,doubling downon Bethlehem andLancaster withtheKRIZZ,yet theycontinue tofindwaystoexclude the CityofScranton .Onecanonlyimagine the impact ofaneighbor improvement zonelike Allentown encompassing themallatSteamtown orthe100blockofWyoming Avenue wherethe Globestoresitsvacant again. Harrisburg needstogetusinthe gameandfinally include Scranton inthese programsthathavebecome tremendous economic engines forparticipating cities andtheyhavetostopfinding waysto continually exclude us.That'sallIhave. Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Gaughan ? MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,thankyou,afew things.First,I'djustliketoannounce thestreet sweeperisscheduled tobeinthe Greenridge areafromGreenridge Streetto FairfieldStreetfromJune8toJune12.I actually ranintothestreet sweeper today inNorthScranton andIwillsaythatthey1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 aredoingafinejobthroughout thecity.

I'llbevoting noonfinalpassage ofthis legislation tonight forafewreasons : First,Ijustwanttobeclearsopeople understand thatbylawthecityhasto contract withanoutside firmtocomplete theaudit.Whatwearevoting ontonight is1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 toallowthecitytohireafirm,Rainey & Rainey,toassemble information togiveto theauditors .Theadministration hassaid thatthereason wemusthirethisfirmis because ofthelimited experience ofthe staffintheBusiness Administration Office. Ibelieve theemployees inthisoffice should becapable ofdoingthiswork.The mayoraddedaposition andincreased salaries intheBA'sOffice.According to the2015budget highlights theBA'sOffice budget reflects afullstaffandcompliment . Howcanwejustify anincrease insalaries andanadditional position ifthejobisn't getting doneandwehavetohireanoutside firmatanadditional andpossibly expensive cost.Theprofessional services budget for theBA'sOfficewasincreased dramatically toinclude stafftraining .Itwasincreased to$130,000. Also,within thegrantapplication thatwassubmitted asking fortheincrease insalaries andfunding foranadditional position ,whichweallvotedfor,PEL recommended thecontinued useofcollege1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 levelinterns toassist inaudit documentation prep.Ifullyunderstand the importance ofcompleting theauditandthe negative consequences ifwedonot. However ,Icannot justify hiring afirmfor twoyearstodotheworktheemployees should bedoing,experienced ornot.A contract withthisfirmtakesthe responsibility offofthestaffwhereit belongs andIbelieve setsabadprecedent .
