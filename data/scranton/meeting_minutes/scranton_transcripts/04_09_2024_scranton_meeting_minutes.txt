GILBRIDE : Yes, Mr. President . At the request of the administration Item 5-E that appears on our agenda has been removed as it is no longer necessary for consideration by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 the Council .

So I also would like to offer my prayers and condolences to Officer John Buntz and his family who passed away last Wednesday . He was a member of the Scranton Police Department for 27 years before retiring in 1989. He was a Chaplin at the Jermyn Lodge No. 2 Fraternal Order of Police for 47 years and a former member of the Police Honor Guard. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 He was Chaplin Police and Secretary for the Lackawanna County Retired Police Officers Association for over 21 years in the greater Scranton area. Also he was in the Chick Feldman Hall of Fame in 1994. And in 2000 he was also inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame. God bless him and his family.

And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few. Saturday , April 20th, we're doing an Earth Day cleanup at Nay Aug Park starting at 9 a.m. We are going to meet at the community building . And South Scranton Resident Neighborhood Association is meeting April 17th at 6:30 at 509 Cedar Avenue. And the last thing is, Council meeting scheduled for April 23rd which is the primary election day, we're going to reschedule it to the 24th, the Wednesday after at the normal time, 6:30. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Another reminder Library Express , which is in the Marketplace at Steamtown will close on Sunday, April 21st. That's their last day when they are open to the public. And everything in the store is 50 percent off. The union contracts once again, firefighters , their arbitration award decision 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 was made on April 4th of last year. That's 371 days ago; and the police on July 28th, 256 days ago. And I don't see any contracts on the City's website . I have mailed in a right-to-know request to see the contract s. And I hope they don't come back with no such documents exist. I saw in reading the backup that firefighters and police comprise 62 percent of all city employees . So you know to me, it's a big difference . You know, the major part of the budget happens to be wages, salaries , and benefits . We should have access to those union contracts . It's not enough to say read the arbitration decision . I want to see a contract . I don't know how you could have a personnel manual which has several chapters which say for union employees refer to your union contract when there is no union contract . But that's just me. Tom Coyne did a great job last week talking about the number of department heads we've had in this revolving door that's called 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 City Hall. I'm trying to make sure I know who's on first for the right-to-know office. It used to be somebody named Gracie Frankie earlier this year. And then I think it was somebody named Kelcie and I think currently it's somebody named Morgan Fetsock . Is that the name of the current right-to-know officer ? MR. SMURL: I believe Morgan, yes, is doing them. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, hoping that 348-4118 is the correct phone number because I put some things in electronically , never hear anything back at all. So I mailed it in. If I don't have a response , I'm going remail it certified mail return receipt requested . Maybe I'll send it to the Mayor, see if she'll sign for it. Can't get into the building if nobody answers the phone. Did you see the article that the Times put out about the tax burden in Lackawanna County? Forty municipalities , Scranton is number 2 out of 40 for the total tax burden. But oh, my God, we're 40 out of 40 for median earnings for workers . What's wrong with that picture ? And the walkability study that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 we -- the presentation at Lackawanna College last Thursday , I was very disappoint ed in the Mayor and the present ers and their failure to answer a direct and important question . How does someone visually impaired know how and when to cross the street if there are four-way stop signs, a lot of dancing around, a lot of outrageous replies like it's better to be hit by a car going 25 miles an hour than one going 45 miles an hour. But here's a question for you. Who is responsible for the Public Safety Committee ? MR. MCANDREW : I am. MS. HODOWANITZ : You are. You know the buttons that you push when you are walking downtown to get a, you know, walk, don't walk reply? You know the vast the majority of them haven't been working for years. Why doesn't anybody fix them? You're not going to move, you know, stop signs overnight . They ought to be fixed and shame on the administration for ignoring them. But I guess, you know, if you're just a pedestrian , you don't count. MR. MCANDREW : I'll bring it up in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Fifth for you. MS. HODOWANITZ : And this 5-E that you are pulling , I read the backup. It looks like Mr. Zakharov has been an employee for several months. Why are they asking for a residency waiver at this point? Is he going to be terminated if he's not moved in within six months? Are you going to push the issue? Thank you. MR. SMURL: Joan -- Attorney Gilbride , will you say it again? I don't believe Joan heard for that -- ATTY. GILBRIDE : 5-E, has been removed from the agenda. MR. HODOWANITZ : I know it's been removed . But the backup indicates that the individual has been working for some time. Let me quote, this man, quote, has excelled in his position and added a great deal of organization data analysis and management skill to the department . That tells me that he's a city employee already . What are you going to do about it? MR. SMURL: Thank you. Lee Morgan. Please, please try to keep order. Lee Morgan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. You know, I just thought I'd bring the residents up to date because I have the city in Federal Court over ECTV, for the Council and the Mayor. And I haven't received a hearing date yet. But I'm still working on that. And I want people to understand that the city receives 1.6 million dollars from the cable company . And to stifle free speech on the public access channel is just beyond my belief. And when we look at our government , we have to ask ourself because they know that they are not representing us. And to constantly go back and talk about being legislators and legislating laws in the city that hurt the residents and the taxpayers is really mind-boggling . Now, I have a hearing coming up with District Justice Farrell soon. I've been trying to get information from the Law Department without any success . But it's not a major thing because I'm going to do a series of subpoenas , probably about 15 of them and have the hearing recorded 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 by a court reporter . But I think the residents of this city have to do a much better job of electing public officials because when you elect a Council that has the right to do investigation s and they don't do it and you allow local government to hurt the residents of the city and experience a population decline of the type that Scranton suffered over decades and keep electing people to Council seats and the Mayor that have all of these great plans as they spread grant money and borrowed money around and deny residents even their earning s with a 2.4 percent wage tax. And when you ask yourself, you know, why would a Mayor and a Council bring illegal people into the city and fund them at the detriment of the residents even though the President of the United States is breaking the law because it's his number one job to secure the border and he hasn't done it. And we have Americans being murdered, raped all across our country , robbed. I mean, recently we had some ladies come from Green Ridge. They were concerned about theft in their neighborhood and not feeling safe. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 But then we find out that in the Abingtons and the local area there were Venezuelans that were breaking into properties and stealing stuff or from South American you might as well say because it's really wide spread. They're looting the country . And then they're selling stuff and then they're sending the money back to South America . This is what our President 's done to the people in our country . So when we talk about the homeless or the vets that aren't being served, they're channelling all of that money to the illegal s and even our own city government is doing that. And it's really troubling . When you look at just the scope of incompetence of our city government , it's like I said to you, Mr. Smurl, with all due respect to you, I think you took the water slide down so you could be appointed as a Councilman . And just because you won an election , winning an election to be a Councilman in this city, look what it's done for us, nothing . We were in distress 30 years and couldn't climb out. And now I think we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 even got the county going that way. But yet still, the county spent $700,000 for a book mobile. It don't make any sense and then claim they're 19 million dollars short. And when you look at the project in front of this building , we could have bought the Stoehr and Fister building for 1.6 million dollars . It was the Courthouse Annex. We could have did some great things for this city. But, you know, we keep wasting grant money and shoving it in places. And it's just detrimental to the residents . And then we have 3a Council that enact laws and strips resident s of their Constitutional rights under a law. And then we force the citizens like myself to go to Federal Court. And now we have the Law Department trying to hide from me. And I just find it to be so -- you know, when the government uses its own assets to attack its citizen s -- and I'm saying to the city, come meet me in a courtroom and let's see what happens . But quit hiding and quit misusing this your power. And this Council empowers them. You're a detriment to the residents of this city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. SMURL: Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . Three weeks ago I came here talking about garbage when you get off the McDade Expressway near Redner's from a former homeless camp and it's still not picked up three weeks later. As I stated last week if Tom Preambo was still DPW Director, that would have been done the next day. As I said last week, he watched these meetings and he took care of stuff right away. I guess just nobody cares what our city looks like anymore because it looks like a garbage dump off the side of the road a little before Redner's and nothing 's being done. Next thing, I spoke about this last week also. What Pennsylvania American Water did to Roaring Brook and the Lackawanna River, there was an article in the Sunday paper. It says mishap badly impacts stream. Macroinvertebrates mostly wiped out in some spots. New deposits of sandy silt rains 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 from shin to 3 and a half feet deep in some spots the study said. Nothing could live in that stream anymore or the Lackawanna River. Something should be done with Pennsylvania American Water. It says they're working it out with DEP to try to fix the problem . They should be made to come in and clean out Roaring Brook and the Lackawanna River. And I said last week the city should sue them for what they did to our environment here. Next thing, as Joan said, I was at that meeting also last Thursday at Lackawanna College about the walkability study and connectivity . She mention ed about the question about how could the vision impaired people cross the street when there's stop signs. Well, I'm the one that asked that question three separate times. Mr. Smurl was there. Mr. King were there. And as she said, they danced around so much they danced to all my questions . They would have got all tens from all the judges on Dancing with the All Stars. The one time I asked how could they cross the street, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 nothing -- there's no noise or anything telling them. The one gentleman said, well, the cars will stop and let them go. I said that still doesn't give them -- I said how does that let them cross the street? They don't know that the cars are stopping to let them cross the street. And that's the answers I was getting last week. Another one said, well, how do they cross other streets ? I said other streets aren't downtown Scranton . When was this study done, on a Sunday morning when everybody 's sleeping or in church and there's nobody downtown ? They want to make -- they want to put stop signs on the corner of Washington and Linden, one of the busiest corners in the city. As I said, Mr. Smurl and Mr. King were there last week. And I think all of you Council people should have been there to hear what a farce this was. They couldn't answer any question s. And it's going to come before you the Mayor said. This has to be voted down. It's totally unsafe for the citizen s, especially the elderly people in this city.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 And after I was done speaking , former city engineer and 50 year city engineer with 50 years experience John Pocius spoke. And he said traffic lights are never to be replaced with stop signs. And that's his opinion with 50 years experience , more experience than those jokers that did the study. So when this comes before Council , you have to turn it down. There is no way people are going to be safe in the city crossing the street. Like I said, they couldn't answer my question . I asked three separate times. And they could not tell me how it's going to be safe for visually impaired people to cross the street with stop signs. They don't hear any noise. So I guess there's going to be another meeting also. So I hope you people attend so you hear how ridiculous this is. That's all I have tonight . Thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello, Council . You think after my disastrous lost code enforcement minute I'd want some better time. But I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 still mad at them. And I'm still mad at the people up there giving Basalyga hero status. That's -- this isn't a matter of right and wrong or what's legal or what's not. It's his opposition to the code enforcement which I don't like as you know. They are still an arm of this city and he's trying to dictate his terms to them which is dictating them to us. That's shameful . This man is far from your hero status that everybody gave him last week. You know, it wasn't very long ago he was crying and pleading poverty so he would get a gigantic tax reduction . I guess it was two years ago. And then a couple weeks ago he brags all of his apartment s are full. It's just what have you done for me lately with him and this city. Well, we need some tax money, not tax parasites like this place is full of. Developers have to exist. They must exist on grants, loan forgiveness , tax abatements . And all of this falls on the taxpayers to make it up. You know, and I've asked you before you just -- you people in this whole administration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 just haven't done one thing about the phoney non-profits . Look at all of that land up there sitting in front of Geisinger , all the millions of dollars that are gone forever just like Lackawanna College down here. The building sat for three years and then we put a roof on them. They didn't pay taxes. All of these parasites are just -- they're just with approval of the city. And in relation to this marque that I was going to get to last week, I've never seen it. I don't go downtown any more than I have to. But to me, downtown is bright lights and street noise and all the things like you see -- I don't know how many of you all ever been to New York City like I have probably two dozen times over the years. I just love to be there with all of that noise. And if someone can't cope with it, let them move. It's nice to see a full house out here, isn't it? One thing, every so often I run into this lady at Gerrity 's. And last week -- she lives off of Main in the 1200 block. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 She asked if that epic that used to be the glass company on the 1200 block if they would put up a fence because it looks so bad. And she evidently lives behind there somewhere . She told me but I don't know the streets . But it is an eyesore . And I guess she doesn't get anywhere with the zoning board. She's told me she's phoned people and they didn't do nothing . I got through it today. It was all right, wasn't it? MR. KING: Very good. MR. ELLMAN: Yeah, thank you. MR. SMURL: Jennifer Reed. MS. REED: Hello. My name is Jennifer Reed. I'm a citizen of Scranton , a taxpayer , and a concerned person living in this community . Here I stand another week has passed and I'm still disappoint ed in our city. Here are some quotes and promise s made to the people of our community , January 7, 2020, the following lines were spoken: One, to bring back certainty to Scranton ; two, we are going to get to do this together ; and three, we cannot afford to be divided . Do you know who spoke those words by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 any chance? MR. SMURL: I do not. MS. REED: That was the Mayor. Here's another one: They were losing hope and they needed people to believe in and that they could trust. Any idea for that one? MR. SMURL: Nope. DR. ROTHCHILD : Dr. Rothchild . MR. SMURL: Mister -- if you outburst again, I'm going to have you removed . You cannot be interrupt ing the speakers . It's their time, not your time. Go ahead. MS. REED: Okay. Scranton 's motto, embracing our people, our tradition s and our future. To embrace means to accept and support . Tradition is a long established custom. Future is a period of time still to come. If you put it all together to accept and support the long established custom for a period of time still to come. It seems like the custom of this city is to reject, neglect , and push out certain members of our community , namely the homeless . When I asked last week how many people were or have been homeless not one of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 you had raised your hand. But many of us on this side of the room did. So I'll ask again, how many people in this room if you could stand up are homeless or have -- MR. SMURL: Ma'am, you have to address Council , please, not the audience . Thank you. MS. REED: Okay. So the people that are standing up are the ones that have been homeless or are currently homeless . Now if they are not homeless , they could sit -- if they don't want to be homeless they could sit down. So all the people that sat down decided they did not want to be homeless . But at this point they really don't have much of a choice. You are disconnect ed from the people that you serve. And I said previously , many of those without homes are taxpayers with jobs. Where's the help that they need? Can you tell me how many people are homeless right now in this city? Any idea? MR. SMURL: I cannot. MS. REED: Okay. So as of 2018 there was 159. But I'm sure that number has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 only gone up since then. How many shelters are there for the homeless people in the city, night shelter not day shelters . MR. SMURL: Well, it depends on what you consider night shelters. MS. REED: Shelters where people could sleep at night, single individual people, not mother and children . There's one. Only one with six beds for women and 20 beds for men. Do you know that there is only one other shelter if the weather is freezing ? That's it. For the most part people rely on small groups together in tents or whatever they have to keep themselves safe. They get the resources together . And they try to work together to survive the best they can. Most people do not want to see them but they also refuse to find resources or a solution to house them. My daughter was here with me last week and she held up a sign. And I'm not sure if anybody remembers what it said. But for those who aren't here or didn't see it, Lackawanna County, the county that we are currently living in has 126 homeless children 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 in Scranton , 16 homeless children in Old Forge, 25 homeless children in Mid Valley and 14 homeless in Riverside. And this is according to the PA Department of Education . And I'm sure that those numbers are most likely under recorded . So I ask what is your plan going forward to make a change? How is the city planning to open more shelters or do they? There's more homeless people on the street and obviously not enough shelters with that many people that are homeless and 26 beds. The math doesn't add up. And how many is the city going to assist me and other members of the community to do the jobs and take care of the people who we are taking care of that the city should be. This isn't our job. We're doing this because we care about these people and obviously more than the city does because we're doing the best we can to make sure that they survive . There's people in cities that freeze to death because they have no choice. I don't think anybody would even blink an eye, bat an eye if somebody froze to death in this city because they weren't given an option to have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 shelter . As was said earlier people are losing hope and they need to be -- to have people to believe in and that they could trust. And they are not trusting many people right now. We do not get paid to do this job. But we do it because we need to do it and because we care about them. For every meal that I serve or every supply that I hand out, do you know what I charge someone ? A single hug. That's it. And that may be the only one that they receive in a long time. When I make a promise to someone I keep it. So why can't the city? Can I bring these up, the handouts with the questions ? MR. SMURL: Sure. Michael Wormuth . MR. WORMUTH : Good evening . I understand that the homelessness and the need for, you know, intervention with the city is very important . But it's also very important to the community to also have structure and cleanliness like the issue with the -- what I understand the issue with what they call the tent areas is because it was -- MR. MCANDREW : Can you come closer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 to the microphone ? MR. WORMUTH : Excuse me, sir? MR. MCANDREW : Would you please come closer to the microphone . I can't hear. DR. ROTHCHILD : Could you state your name as well? MR. WORMUTH : Michael Wormuth . Thank you. What I noticed with them areas is that they lacked like porta johns or garbage . And that's what becomes one of the major problematic . It's an eyesore to the city and whatnot . But it's -- there's very small needs that can be address ed that could eliminate most of those issues like zoning in different areas where they could put their tents, you know, in certain times or certain months and so it doesn't cause and overabundance of garbage or whatnot because that's a lot of the issue is that a lot of the homeless just what I have noticed don't have anywhere to put their tents or somewhere to sleep at night. So it could be something that could be solved with a very minimal impact to the city or to other people it would just be these are the areas, you know, during these times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 that you could set up or where you could set up your tents. That was one of the solutions . But that was all I had to say about those issues. But I thank you for your time this evening . And I thank you for hearing us. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Aaron Lee. MR. LEE: Good evening , City Council . My name is Aaron Lee. I'm a resident of the city. Last week I was here and I spoke upon our family members that's actually homeless . It's not just me. It's an abundance number of us. Me as well, I'm a taxpayer . I pay taxes. So also within the HUD which is Section Eight housing I believe there's a protocol somewhere in place homeless prevention . So when you're trying to provide homeless prevention , you're going to provide resources which means we're not going to let this person go homeless . We're going to try to step forward and overcome this so that this person does not go homeless . It seemed like it's a pandemic just like the Covid and there's no vaccine to cure it. But we can help out. We could come 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 together to make sure these things are done. I'm currently in that shelter , that one shelter here in Scranton and my time is almost up. And I asked, and I asked, and I pled and I wanted housing assistance , preventative of homelessness . I'm a taxpayer . So my money goes into it as well. Also last week I believe it should have been some budget put together for a coordinator . I believe Tom from DPW had something to say about that. Mrs. Doctor should have had something to say. Mrs. Doctor Was absent for almost 20 minutes during our last hearing . And then there was nothing stated about the homelessness that's going on from the Doctor. I think the Doctor should also oversee what's going on and can that budget be fulfilled? And also, there's people that's on the waiting list of Section Eight HUD housing , homeless prevention . We got people in wheelchairs . We got people with mental illnesses that cannot come here and speak on their own behalf. And I will continue to come here and speak on their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 behalf. Also, the other week I witnessed that there was a parent that had a child with them and cannot go into the shelter because the child was not 18 or older. So there is not just adults that's homeless . We have children that is homeless and where is homeless prevention . Again, where I go back to. There is no answers. In the last meeting no one address ed the homelessness . Where is the budget? There was questions asked to me which I felt was very disrespectful . So I have all of these questions to you. So if my day comes up within next two to three days and I'm homeless , this is public streets. I should be able to allow to walk all the through these streets , around City Hall, put a tent next door and sleep their peaceful ly or go next to the police station and walk around that until I pass out correctly , right? And if the sidewalk s is not paved right, so now I'm going to get stagnant and continuing doing the same thing and get weak. And then that's city's property , correct , so then I believe that's a lawsuit on their hands, which I don't want to do. Why fight amongst 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 each other? Also, the other week I was walking behind CIC, 445 North Sixth Avenue. And I had an officer harass me and asked me for my ID. I never committed not one single crime. And I thought it was against the rules that I was being harassed which in several meeting s said leave the homeless alone. Can I get that officer 's number -- badge number because I want to make sure that the homeless is not going to be harassed just because I'm a man walking down the street, an alley. There's not a sidewalk there. But you come through with a F150 black truck and want me to move out your way? I was just leaving out of CIC. How about let's go with the ordinance ? How many times have any of these organization s CIC, St. Anthony's or the Mission , when was their last fire inspection ? Why is there gates on the windows? Was they there before that structure was built? Why is there gates, bars? You cannot exit those windows. Just in case of a fire, how do we exit? You are the city. You tell me that or can we get that fire chief over there as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 soon as possible ? I'm not going to stand down for none of this because if I got to go, we all going. Telling you, Doctor, Matt, you, you, Tom -- MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Lee. Thank you. MR. LEE: You're welcome . MR. SMURL: You're time is up. Rick. If you are going to outburst, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. This is a public meeting . Thank you. Rick Cephas. MR. CEPHAS: Good evening , distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the City Council . If you guys don't remember me, I'm Rick Cephas, President of the NAACP Lackawanna County branch. I'm not going to take up too much of your time. But I just want to read you something , okay. And this is what the NAACP considers the world guide to dealing with police. If you are approached by an officer , ask for a lawyer immediately upon being arrested or are being in custody . Stay calm and keep your emotions from getting the best of you. Be courteous even if the officer isn't. Carry identification at all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 times and be prepared to produce it. Keep your hands where the officer can see them, take pictures if you are injured and seek medical attention as soon as possible . Remember the officer s' names and badge numbers as well as any witness information . Write everything down. Don't run. Don't touch the officer . Don't make any statements about the incident without first having spoken to a lawyer because you do have the right to remain silent. Now, if you are on the street, an officer may briefly stop to ask you identifying questions . You are not required to answer those questions , but failing to answer simple ones truthfully will make the officer suspicious . They're always suspicious . If requested , show your ID. That's what we have to do, show it. You are not require d to consent to a search of yourself or your property . If police have reasonable suspicion that you have a weapon or illegal substance , they may do a pat-down. Don't resist. If you feel you have been unlawfully 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 detained , remember the officer 's badge number and all identifying information . Use your cell phone and other technology to record or photograph the interaction if you can do so safely. I'm not going to berate Council or anybody else for inaction s or the actions of certain officers that work on the force. I'm not going to berate you over the treatment of the homeless even because that's already been -- you've already got that. Last time I was here it was mistaken my anger for passion . Do not mistake my anger for my passion . I am not angry. I am never angry. I am very passion ate about my position . I am very passionate about who I represent . And if you did not notice, I was one of those ones that stood up when she asked if you had ever been homeless stand up. I stood up. I was homeless in Atlanta . I was homeless up here. And I was given the right opportunities to get my life right. And these are the same opportunities that no one else seems to get. And I want to know why. I want to know why these resources aren't made 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 available . Hold on. Now you're talking about the resources . Where's the plan? Where's it wrote out what do you plan to do about it? Where is that sketched out? Once because -- once -- and then you got to sit down and talk with us how can we make this work for everybody . Okay? And then you could talk budget. Then could you talk numbers . We don't want to put the horse in front of the cart. But I haven't heard any plans on what to do about this homeless situation here in Scranton . I haven't heard anything about plans to deal with the teenager s that are homeless out here that go to school and then go back to the streets . And then they got this crazy -- crazy gang plan that you want to implement and I don't understand where that came from and I don't understand why the NAACP wasn't brought into that conversation . They're still having talks about gang-related innocents and programming that the people that need to be in those talks have not been invited to. So the only thing I'm asking City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Council to do is to do your job. And to remind the people of Scranton , we put them up there. I just want you to remember that. We put them up there. We could also take them out. Thank you. MR. SMURL: That's the end of the sign-in list. Does anybody else want to speak to Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Council , I was at the walkability study. And I found it interesting when people in the public provided comment and reasonable statements for clarification and opposition , the Mayor stood up and tried to interfere with the public comments only those in opposition , in fact. A section of the people were painted as those people who oppose. The present er asked based on my questions , are you a lawyer? If I was fast enough I would have responded objection , relevance . And in thinking about it, I'm not sure if being asked if I was a lawyer was a compliment or an insult. I understand the comment was meant to interrupt my line of questioning . When they presented terms that I don't understand , I do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 research . I ran into studies that oppose what they actually said. And I'm -- and then brought that up as a review. It is then that the Mayor jumped up and tried to stop me during public comment . But that's for a later time. When we remove the waiver of residency from the agenda but from the backup document it shows that his start date requested was 9/2 of 2023, which is well beyond the six-month period. What's also disturbing is the lack and the avoidance of anything in that entire document stating the employee 's official original start date. It was obvious avoidance of the issue. Now onto Mr. Schuster 's question last week on 5013Cs. Let's take a closer look. Before you are even homeless , some of this is outdated because it changes over the years. I will pretext this on whatever you ask a utility for help or to use a program like a credit card company , they avoid the help path and try to put you on back billing and payment plan to catch up with your current bill. They loathe just to offer you a way out first and try to upsell the help that's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 in your interest . People in the city looking for help, they go to welfare , drag in a lot of paperwork. They offer food stamps. And it's -- if it's headed off to winter you could apply for LIHEAP for your primary heating . You say you have other issues with shutoff notices and such. You may get cash and insurance , but the insurance really lacks mental health. It's often for a 45 minute session max once a week, more often once a month so they could give you meds. They may help you if they know the electric was shut off and it's not your primary heat. Or you had a notice, you could put up for a LIHEAP emergency in there. But then it goes to a 5013C in Carbondale for review. If you have water or sewer issues, you had to go to Hilltop to the food bank and fill out paperwork for an H20 help grant in a two or three-hour window once or twice a week. If you wanted help with your insulation for your home, no one was aware of and would tell you that there is a weatherization program that is run by the city -- that is run by the state. But if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 go to that website , it lists the location as the bank building on Wyoming and Spruce. It's obviously that building since it's empty for years, not anyone is there and there is no signs on it that they actually moved. You call the state number, they offer up the web page and that gives us the same bad information. The actual place it's located is in the Globe Store now. You need some utility help and you're not sure, maybe rental assistance , well, then Neighbor Works was handling the federal aid and would pay some and get county funds as well. But that was the Covid funds. And they may or may not be doing it now. So you have to contend with the time of year, Center City public assistance , Carbondale reviewing it, travel to South Side Hill Section when the food bank is open twice a week, track down a group who has moved leaving no forward ing address , visit another Center City location for information and they are not aware where that agency is. Do the gymnastics . It's impossible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 for those who have drug or mental issues. This is not a Scranton issue. It's how 5013Cs work in other regions as well. Why is not coordinated ? Because each 5013C gets its cut. If you coordinate it, it makes it easier. But then you don't need five or six agencies each getting a cut of the pie. There is a disincentive to making help centralized . And every few years the location and the players change. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. KOLOSKI : Hi, Doris Koloski , Scranton resident . What I have to say now seems trivial . I want to talk about that walkability study. I had a few questions . I was unable to make the meeting . And I only know what I saw in the paper. And according to them they were going to take down the traffic lights and put in the four-way stop signs and something was said about if it didn't work out they'd have to put all those traffic lights back in. It would be way too expensive . So they weren't going to be able to do that. I myself can't understand how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 four-way stop signs will be better than traffic lights. I mean, I have one right on my corner. Cars sit there like you go, you go, you go and waive each other on and then they start going at the same time half the time and then they stop again. But my suggestion is if they really pass this and they were going to do something like replace those with four-way stop signs, why not leave the traffic lights intact, put up a test the four-way stop signs. Let's see how it goes. If it's not good, they take the four stop signs out and the traffic lights are there intact to turn on. You could turn the lights off while you're working with four-way stop signs. Why don't you test it out before you spend a whole lot of money and then find out it's not going to work. A lot of big places I was at when I was with like my granddaughter , streets like Wyoming Avenue, that width, they had islands in the middle. They have extra traffic lights. You crossed from one side of the corner to the island on one light. And then you went from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 the island across the rest of the way on the other lights. And the cars went down one side and up the other and they all had push buttons . So, I mean, I don't know. But it bothered me to think that the city would tear down all the traffic lights, put up four-way stop signs which in my opinion aren't going to work. But I don't really know that much about it except for what I see when I'm driving around. And then if it doesn't work out, what are they going to do? So I just say why don't you run a test before you vote on it. And the other thing as long as I still have some time is, they still haven't cut the curb down up on Olive and Colfax if that's ever going to happen. And that's it. Have a good night, people. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Doris. Anyone else? MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And again, I have to say that it's just very enlightening to hear the information that was presented by the homeless people. I've never been homeless . I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 know what that's like. But I do know the reason that I volunteer so much is that I don't want to stay on my level and only be surrounded by those like me. I volunteer so that I can get involved with those situations that I've never been involved with before. It's been very enlightening to, as I said last week, to work at the Keystone Mission that we do meals down there to do the sleeping bags for the homeless . So would I be involved with that if I wasn't volunteering , probably not because I would go to lunch with those people just like me that could afford those things just like I could afford. So it gives any me greet opportunity to look around because but for the grace of God there go I. And I think we've all probably heard that particular Bible verse. So I have to again speak for them. And I'll continue to volunteer . I'll continue to do those things that I do to help not only the homeless and there's a lot of people that have the food insecurities out there as well. So that's, you know, I wasn't going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 to speak about that. That's not why I came to the podium. But, you know, saying nothing means that I agree if I don't say something . I wanted to give more information and I thank you I think, Mr. Smurl, you mentioned about the cleanup that's going to be up at Nay Aug Park for Earth Day. Earth Day is April 22nd. And we are asking for volunteers to come to Nay Aug on August -- April 20th and to come with your rakes and your gloves to help us out. There is a phone number that you could call to register yourself or your group. That number is 507-241-9008. And you could leave your information on that, you know, just so we could get an idea of just who's going to be there and who's coming. You know, Lord willing , I'll be there at the concession stand to help those to get organize d and hopefully to give out the bags that day. So also, at the park if anyone's been there we've installed 30 new tables, picnic tables in the park. And they're steel and they're absolutely wonderful . A lot of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 them were put by one of the playgrounds , the Jay Bird Playground . And they're scattered out so that as we see families there coming to use the playground equipment , they could also now have their picnic lunch there at the tables. And thank you to, Mr. Smurl, and a lot of other volunteers this past Saturday . They did install 30 tables. So that's another thing that as summer days are coming that they could avail themselves of those. I'm hoping that we could hear something from the Parks and Recs Department as to the cleanup that's needed. And I know, Mr. Schuster , you're working on that. So I'm hoping that we could get something definite before Memorial Day because once Memorial Day hits, that's when the park becomes very, very active. And we'll start our summer concerts and everything like that. So we just enjoy seeing people enjoying Nay Aug Park. But we also wanted to be all that it can be and the gem that it can be. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Norma. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . You know, on October 2nd of 2000 my house burned. It was a rental. And, you know, I was fortunate I had the fortitude to buy insurance and everything . And I kind of took the burn off the deal. But, you know, for about two or three nights I was sleeping in my car with my doggy to keep her calm. And I didn't know where I was going to go. And I found a partially furnished house and everything worked out. But I understand and we have a national problem with homeless . And before Covid, there was 55,000 children attending school in New York City -- homeless , out of homeless shelters . And now it's exponentially more like three maybe four times, who knows and the shipping people up from the border isn't helping either. Now, I'll get to what I was about to talk about earlier . Landfill slapped with a $575,000 fine. Well, you know, back in 1980s I heard there was $225,000 a day being taken in. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 So, I mean, talk about don't do that again. We'll send you a nasty letter with perfect punctuation . Now, the point being they also want to dump sewer water -- their leachate water into a brook that flows right through Nay Aug Gorge. And it's a shame. I hope people wake up to that and just say no. Okay, and as far as the PA Water Company is concerned , I think when these people do egregious things, hold the executives responsible . Tell them off the board, you are no longer a member of the board of PA American Water. And by the way, if you want to sell your stocks cheap it would be helpful . We don't need this 95 percent of them river -- stream damaged . Okay, now, with our downtown theme park; and that's what I call it, a theme park. The cost, nobody asked and I could kick myself for it. But my leg doesn't go that far anymore. I'm 70 on Thursday . But is 8 million ever going to really be enough to put all new period lights, all new sidewalks, bury the electric ity underground, all kinds of paving, all kinds of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 sprucing up, and what do we have? A whole lot of ornamentation . And then some of it is, like I said, up at -- this issue's been here before up at Scranton U you can't see the student s behind the trees. And then the boys, of course, I'm tough. I'm young. They don't press the crosswalk light. And they step right out in front of you. You know, it's just -- and I hear nothing ever from universities and colleges about counter arguments for this. I -- no counter research , nothing . It's just like, oh, this is it. This is like from heaven. God told us to do this, whatever . I don't hear any -- I don't hear any kind -- I'm going to have to go online and do some research on this and hopefully some other people will get a bug in their ear and do the same about the negatives of this. Look up the old newspaper , what cities it was done and see about citizen s that don't like it. And furthermore , being that they are 501C3s and C4s, that means tax exempt. And in order to be tax exempt you have to educate the public on both sides of the coin, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 not just your side, not just God is going to come down and save us all day from the floods so don't bother building a boat. Have a good day. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? State your name, please. LUELLA: My name is Luella. I'm here to speak about how we were homeless and there was things for us. All I keep hearing about what you guys didn't do. There is things that you did do. And I'm here to advocate for that because I don't want to lose our program s, okay. I came from CIC program . I came from Keystone . I came from Weston Field. I go swimming there. I get to go work out there. There's beautiful things you guys offer, okay. So I'm going to advocate for that. I have an apartment now. I lived outside for six months in a tent that people took care of me see. I did the program . I went through CIC. I did the right things. I have an apartment . A lot people don't want to do the work so they are not given the privileges , right? So I just want to say that I don't want 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 to see you guys take away what we already have because I hear a lot of what we don't have and what we do -- this is wrong, okay. They need to be saying what they do have and they need to understand that they have to work a program to get something to get somewhere . My identity was stolen. Everything was taken away from me. I was like Job in the Bible I call it, right. I came back. I have a place to stay. When it was a blizzard outside , I sat in my apartment praying thank God you guys did something for me because I know those program s come from you guys, okay. So I hear all of this stuff about what you don't do, okay. I saw what you do do because I am a success story here. Now there is a program that needs to be done here. I want to make a star program called self-taught angel resources . People need to have steps on how to get back their identity , okay. My license was stolen. My money was stolen, my credit cards. I'm on SSI. Everything was stolen from me. I had nothing . But if there wasn't those program s, I wouldn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 have eaten. I wouldn't have had a place to sleep. I wouldn't have had friends. I wouldn't have had nobody. So I am a success story because of you guys, okay. I just want to let you know that. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Give it to Mr. Voldenberg , please. MR. LITTLE: Hi. My name is Rik Little. And I -- I'll tell you, homelessness is like first day of wrestling practice in spades. It's just hell. And the homeless thing is based on the homeless person's behavior . And because all the things -- it's a behavioral thing. I've been trying to get help and they use the Courts. When I say they, I mean the federal funded agencies , Scranton Housing Authority . They use the Courts. And they won. And the problem is laws. I hear people, oh, yeah, shout out to Lee Morgan. He's right on about the public access because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 they changed the laws. I was all involved in that. But they changed the laws. It's been messed up here for about 30 years. There were about five mayors, a lot of bad things have happened, kids for cash and all kinds of stuff. And anyway, I'm homeless . I'm trying to figure out how did this happen, you know, because my landlord was just attacking me, attacking me day after day. They confiscated my stuff. They put it in another room. I called the police. The police say see the manager. And we're talking code enforcement , they are doing construction for two years. I didn't know who to call. That's when I started coming here talking , you know, because , you know, I go to the police. I went to every place I could, you know, the sheriffs . The sheriff s don't know what's going on. I'm doing court watching . I'm watching the courts. And immediately I'm surrounded by all of these sheriffs and, you know, questioning me what are you doing. And, you know, they take your phone away. And, you know, all my evidence was always on my phone. But these are particular 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 things. But, you know, so I get evicted . And I get this letter I guess it's from Judge Barrasse 's sister on October 3rd. This is where I prevailed in court but I'm waiting on the ERAP funds. I applied for it four times. And here's -- I'll read a little bit of the letter. Please be advised that I'm a solicitor to the Lackawanna County Area Agency on Aging. I am in receipt of your correspondence dated September 21st, 2022, wherein you provided a history of some of your housing issues related to apartment . While the L-A -- LCAA, Lackawanna County Area Agency on Aging is not a party to the eviction proceedings , our focus has been to two-fold. First, we provided you with resources available to all Lackawanna County residents to assist in eviction proceedings ; and second, provide you with alternative housing resources in the event the final court process finds in favor of your landlord , which is SHA. Additionally , our office assisted you with completing your ERAP application , made 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 recommendation s as to financial counseling and/or representative payee services like Advocacy Alliance , provided you with food supplies , offered Meals on Wheels delivery and referred you to the Scranton Counseling Center with caseworker accompaniment offered. With the exception of the ERAP application , you have refused all offered services . LCAA has also -- allegations without -- has also investigated allegations of financial exploitation and emotional abuse of me. Unfortunately you made general allegation s without any specific information of evidence or substantiate either financial exploitation or emotional abuse. Well, later on in the letter -- here's what it says. ERAP is willing to pay your back rent. And SHA will accept those funds as payment in full. And then they take me back to court after the ERAP runs out. It's all about follow the money, the federal money. Keep on it. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. LABROSKY : Good evening , Council , Lynn Labrosky , lifelong resident , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 homeowner, business owner. So we survived eclipse . Speaking of that, I feel like something is really changing in the city. I feel like the dark is coming to light. And I just feel a movement happening , the homeless , the garbage and other issues in the city are finally being exposed. Also, I'm seeing more community involvement , people coming together , more communications , cleanups -- parks, Nay Aug, side streets . But it's not coming with any help from the city. It's all volunteers . And volunteers are great, but we can use a little help from the city and support from the city I would think. I had a woman reach out to me that found me through Council . And it was just three of us and we cleaned up a pretty good section of a street where it was -- it was -- it wasn't even just garbage . It was overgrown leaves and all types of things. So one hour and three people and it wasn't that hard. So my husband yesterday and the day before -- yesterday and today actually picked up a homeless woman and took her to pick up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 trash. She wants to work. So he gave her something to do. And they cleaned an entire empty lot and filled bags and there was -- anyway, today they went back to finish. And a DPW truck did pull up, a pickup truck and basically refused to take the garbage because it wasn't separated . I don't know what to say. And maybe it wasn't that person's fault. Maybe it was from higher up or whatever . Because I do believe there was a neighbor that came out and was very, very thankful . Her name was Ann. And she appreciated it. And she said she was going to contact DPW. Basically DPW did not pick up the trash. And we wasted an entire hour of the city's time in not picking up the trash. So I guess they refused to take it. I just don't know. I'm just wondering what it's going to take to get city department s to do their jobs and step up and do what they're being paid to do. I just think people are fed up with the direction that the city is going. And aside from the taxes breaking the people's backs in the city, like, can we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 talk about the pothole s because , like, I literally -- I literally watched a mother with a baby strapped to her chest today crossing the street with her small daughter three or four years old. And, like, I have a dash cam. So I'm going to check on that. But she, like, literally fell in the pothole in the middle of the street. And she yanked her daughter up by the hand and, of course, I asked if they were okay. If they needed a ride I would have done that. But it's just unacceptable . And she said, well, that's because our mayor is not doing anything for us in this city. And those are her words, not mine -- but, like, literally a kid laying in the middle of the road. Not a lot of time. So the street signs, the contracts , Les's sidewalk . I don't know. I just wrote down a bunch of bullet points. Thanks, Norma. Like little simple things that are dire, I just don't understand where the common sense is. Like, lawsuit s are waiting to happen. And I know out front the steps are dark when you leave here at night. It's dark 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 out there. Somebody 's going to fall. Somebody 's going to get hurt. Oh, and the big gapping hole in the ground it's been there for eight months. They finally put a stop work order on it. It was stop worked on eight months ago. And then they went up and put a couple horses around it. But there's still a big gapping hole in the ground. So and I did see the Mayor at the ribbon cutting for the movie theater . And she assured me that she was ramping it up to an emergency . But the hole is not filled in and it's still wide open so, yeah. MR. SCHUSTER : What was the location of the hole that you were talking about? MS. LABROSKY : It was Hampton and 12th. And across the street are a big bunch of cinderblocks out in the middle of the road for as long as the hole on the other side has been there. But you got to come up to this podium and pick your battles . You can't -- I wanted to talk about the homeless . I wanted to talk a lot of things but you run out of time. And there's not just like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 one or two issues in this city. There's, like, a lot of issues. So all right, thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Frank, can we take a look at Hampton and 12th? Send that over and see what we get if we get any information on it. MR. VOLDENBERG : DPW was out on both. I'll follow up. MR. THOMAS: John Thomas, Senior, from Scranton . You have to bear with me. I'm a terrible speaker . I'm here about -- I was here a couple of times in the past about the situation in the 1700 block of Dickson Avenue below Green Ridge. You have a school there on one side on top of the hill on Electric Street. The other side you have a new high rise. It hasn't opened yet. It's going to be opening . And you go in front of the other side of the street, there is another senior high rise. The street is narrow. And I think that somebody from Council and somebody that studies traffic should go down there and take a look at it for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 themselves and, you know, get some kind of answer. I think it should be a one way but I don't know. I'm not a traffic study person. You have to look at it and the traffic . Another thing is, are you familiar with the Giant in Green Ridge Plaza, in the front there, a big area, I don't know if they are putting a new building or water or what's going on there. It's all fenced off for a couple months now. So the Colts bus, what they have to do is, they have to go around in the back of the Giant, you know, where you have your -- where they go with their trucks and so on. And there's other, like, little stores. And that back road, there's a lot of potholes back there. And I was wondering , you know, if they could fill in sometime. That is considered a city road, isn't it? It's right in back of the Giant. MR. SMURL: I don't know. I'll put it down. MR. THOMAS: Yeah, if somebody could, you know -- MR. SCHUSTER : Is that Nay Aug Ave?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 MR. THOMAS: It's Nay Aug Avenue there in Green Ridge and Giant Market in the back. On a lighter note, the 500 block of Lackawanna Avenue you have Buona Pizza across the street on one side of the street. Across the street you have a bank. I can't think of what the name of it is. And next to that is an art gallery . Not the art gallery on the wall, they have the Office mural. I'm sure one of you must have seen it, maybe all of you. Just my suggestion , I don't know anybody in the art department , maybe somebody on Council or Mayor could get together and on the other side there's like a little parking lot there is the restaurant , the Coney Island restaurant . And that wall is like big brick wall. Right across from where the Seinfeld mural is. If they could put a Seinfeld mural on the other side, I think it would be a nice suggestion . And this is something that because I live in town and I'm retired, I walk around town and all that. And as you know, the Rite Aid is closed for a while now. I think it would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 nice if the city could possibly get in touch with somebody or to put a drug store there that sells not counter -- not prescription drugs, like over-the-counter drugs, you know, because in downtown you have the Prescription Center. And you have Sheeley 's and, of course, they are mainly prescription . So if somebody could, you know, open up like a little what do you call for drugs -- over-the-counter drugs, I think it would be a pretty good idea where Rite Aid was. Thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Thank you for the three of you present here this evening . Unfortunate ly, the two of you that want to hear. As we move forward , I want to address Council this evening about something that's very personal to me. Right now the gloves are off. That's canines . I brought this matter up two weeks ago with the intention on making sure that our city remains safe from crime, from violence , from drugs and guns. We have two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 canines that could hit on fentanyl and guns, one of them is going to be retiring in the not so distant future. It's going to leave us with one throughout the school year and into the month of December . It's 40 hours. There's 168 hours in the week. How is that safe? It's not. Mr. Smurl, after I spoke about this, I heard a story. From one father to another , I heard not too long ago about you losing a child as well. We hear about this far too often now. Down in West Hazleton there was a traffic stop. A gentleman pulled over, 2000 fake M30s, enough to kill 37 people. Do you think there's 2000 here in the city? I do. They're all over the place. Drugs are running rampant . And this Mayor, she decides to do nothing about it. More important to her are stop signs in downtown Scranton . What really bothers me too is that we have a canine unit that since last summer has been driving around without air conditioning . That canine is suppose d to have a harness -- something around its neck to make sure that it stays safe in the back. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 Mayor doesn't care. She's not even from here. She's from the west coast, Oregon. Pacific Coast Paige, let me tell you something . PCPs are not good for you. Pacific Coast Paige will go in the not so distant future. This railway system's coming through . She's leaving this area unsafe, leaving our police officers at risk, leaving our city at risk. There's not one solution . What does she do? She displaces people that are living together like a family, the homeless . She just scattered them all throughout the region, not just in the city but throughout Lackawanna County, all right, with no plan in place. A good administrator would have a plan in place. Bigger cities, they use these storage containers . We're sitting on a whole bunch of ARPA funds. She cares about street signs, giving money to people that are pushing candles , giving money to people free so they could leave the area. It's not good enough for me. These roads are atrocious . When the roads go bad, we start to receive blight. All right. Blight's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 not good for the area because it attracts crime. It attracts undesirables . And we're going to have that in our region. We already have it here. We've had gang activity since 2008, okay? This is unacceptable . She cannot find $60,000 in a budget for three canines . She doesn't deserve to be the Mayor if that's the case if you cannot find $60,000 to keep your community safe. It's not worth voting her back into office. You know, she's firing people. There's other people that need to go as well. Tom Oleski, CIC, do you know what that is? Confidential informant car. It might be on schedule . It might not be, maybe Tuesday , 3:00. Watch the people when they walk in there because somebody might end up getting a free detail at your expense . The EPA and the DEP are coming. And far as Mike Gowarty, the guy likes to take cans out of the trash up at Nay Aug instead of doing his duty and being a good city employee and looking at these houses. Instead , he's up at Nay Aug picking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 cans out of the garbage . That's fine because I remember him from St. Ann's Monastery . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Mancini . MR. MANCINI : -- he had the worse car (inaudible ). It's quite the focker. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: I know that I mention ed that we recently received $333,955 for the City of Scranton from a multimodal grant through the Commonwealth Financing Authority . The person that was integral in us receiving those funds was former City Council President Kyle Donahue who is now our State Representative . So I just wanted to -- I like to give credit where credit is due. And I want to thank our state rep for providing that funding . That's going to help us to get more street signs in the city and hopefully we could get that project rolling . And I appreciate Representative Kyle Donahue for taking care of us in that way. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 Also tomorrow , the City of Scranton is going to be honored with a Governor 's award at 10:30 tomorrow down in Harrisburg . And that honor is coming, you know, pretty much so because of the fact that we've been able to turn the city around in terms of finances . It wasn't long ago too -- less than two and a half years ago that the city for 30 years was in Act 47 financial recovery . And now we have a BBB plus bond rating. So we've come a long way. We have a long way to go. But we were nominated for this Governor 's award. And I'm hoping to get down there tomorrow with -- I think our Council President is going to be down there as well along with the Mayor. But that's a great honor for the City of Scranton . So I'm looking forward to go down there and see us get recognized in Harrisburg for helping to turn the city around financially . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have several 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 comment s. The first one was last week an individual from the Municipal Rec Board asked about leaf pickup at Nay Aug. I did send out an e-mail either that night or the following morning . I didn't hear anything back yet. I sent another one yesterday . I haven't heard anything back as of today. But Mr. Smurl in caucus brought up about getting DPW over possibly with the vac truck to the Earth Day cleanup. So that might be a good day to get that over there. But if I find out something or get any information back, I'll report out. We did get a memo to Council about some budget transfers . So there are three budget transfers . One is -- one of those transfers is we're transferring $121,870 from the childcare wage boost to the childcare individual reimbursement . The second one is $139,984 from the wage boost again to the business startup fund. And then a $405,676 from the small business grants line item to the small business startup fund. So, Mr. Voldenberg , what I'm going to ask is if we could reach out to the business 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 office and ask for the reasoning for this, whether some of these program s are more successful than others or what kind of metrics we're using to move this money into these areas rather than where they were originally . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. So with the leaf pickup -- and it says it's part of the Parks Department spring cleanup check list. But the work has been delayed due to the weather . A large number of leaves that need to be removed by vac truck. We're going to work on this as soon as the weather permits or coordinate the vac truck pickup with the DPW. So that will be leaf pickup with DPW. Next, I've been travelling on Washburn Street, South Sherman Avenue and noticed the condition of the roads. I do know they're doing some -- PA American Water is doing some work on these areas. However , we do have to make our roads able to be drivable . So at this point in time I feel the roads in areas are barely drivable and it's the utility companies ' responsibility to ensure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 that we can drive on the roads. There was a question asked last week about the pave cut inspector . And we did get an answer. And I'm going to steal Mr. King's question , I guess. The city has one dedicated pave cut position in DPW and a floater that works between the pave cut and traffic . So I do have a question for the administration , Mr. Voldenberg . And it is, can we get a comparable list of pave cut receivables from 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 so that would be revenue s brought in from those pave cut permits for those four years so we could compare them? I know at this point in time in our budget we do have two position for pave cut inspect or. And the other question is as we got the answer that we have one dedicated pave cut inspector , is the other position open? I would assume it's open, but if that position is open. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find out, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. When it comes to labor billing , did we get any -- did we receive any other further labor billing ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We have not. I checked yesterday morning .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. If we could ask again. I know I made several requests . One request was to get the labor billing for the fire and police contract s. I've kind of expanded that request to get all labor billing up until this point, so if we could reach out again on that. Next, the Keyser Valley grant process , can we find out where we're at with the Keyser Valley grant process ? How many grants have been awarded , what we have pending , and if any were declined? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I also sent an e-mail over to you, Mr. Voldenberg , in the last several days for the areas of Woodlawn , Grandview , and Wyoming Avenue. It was a request about storm basins and a cleanup schedule . Spring is coming. And I know some of the heavy rains are going to start. In those areas they were concerned about basins that were full. MR. VOLDENBERG : They have been reported and an additional one on Grandview Street.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you very much. That's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few comments , mostly in a response to a lot of what was spoken about tonight during citizens participation . There is first one thing that I want to address which I know that I don't need to address but I'm going to anyway in the event that it comes up again in the future. But I did mention last week that some of my absences have been due to medical illness . Also, I just had a baby two weeks ago. So I do have a newborn . If I am absent for a period of time during meetings or the caucus, it's because I'm a breastfeeding mother. So I might be breastfeeding my child who's downstairs right now or pumping breast milk which I don't think you want me doing here in Council Chambers during the meeting . So I will take that time to go out and do that. I am allotted up to 12 weeks from my job as a physical therapist for maternity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 leave. I'm not taking maternity leave here. It's important for me to come to Council , spend my Tuesday nights here and do my job as a City Council woman and still perform my job as a mother. So I'm going to keep doing that. And if anyone has a problem with it, tough. And the next thing I'm going to address is with regards to homeless and displaced community . First off, I want to say I absolutely sympathize with those who are homeless or displaced . I never found myself in that situation fortunately . But I do understand that some people are just one paycheck away from being there, don't have a place to go or, you know, if they lose their jobs they don't know what to do next. There is a lot of situation s that people get into that can result in them becoming displaced . And, you know, I hate to see that happen. I hate to see that we do have many who are homeless here within the city. And I previously spoken about the issue in past Council meeting s. I think I've spoken more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 about it than other Council members and with more sympathy towards that community . I also have spoken in past with the police chief and it has been a little bit of time. So I will go to him again for further updates . But at the time when we spoke I was told that people were not being actively removed from homeless encampments or their properties were not being destroyed . But maybe some of that has changed now, which I definitely want to address . And they also expressed to me that their primary concern were if there were crimes being committed then that's when they would step in and intervene . He also explained that the officers do try to help provide resources to those that are homeless . I'm only relaying what, you know, some of the discussion that we had in the past was. And that's, you know, what I would hope would be happening . I've also stated the need for more shelter s and resources . If I could get a new shelter set up tomorrow , I absolutely would. But, you know, we certainly have to be working with different 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 community organization s to do that, you know, see what monies are available to do that. Some of the key people within the city that I believe that, you know, that would fall under would be the public health coordinator . However , we've been without a public health coordinator . I would really like to see that position filled. I think we had a year left still within a grant to pay for that person. But I think that would be an appropriate person to help address the issue. Also my -- the committee that falls under me is community development . So having a director for the office of community development would be additional ly very helpful . And that would be another place where we could work together to find some more solutions for the homeless community . I understand wanting to see action. And I'm absolutely committed to continuing conversations with the administration and our departments to figure out an actionable plan to be able to help people. So that's -- that's all that I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. Thank you. So I'm going to address , you know, I'm only speaking on behalf of myself but why 5-E was pulled and the problem I have with it being pulled because I'm a man of process and procedure and principle . So I've been on on Council for five years. I'm entering my fifth year. And the problem I have with this is -- and I agree, you know, we constantly hear the term that City Hall is a revolving door. And, you know, frankly the city has more turnovers than National Bakery and quite possible Pilsbury . And there's a reason for that. So two weeks ago the head of DPW resigned, okay. The next day in the paper the gentleman who is going to replace him or cover for him is a gentleman who already passed his six months and had to move into the city and he did not. So then, you know, the administrative code and the Home Rule Charter says if the Mayor wants a waiver it has to be sent for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 advice and consent to us before the hire. All right. This gentleman 's already working here six months. So then legislation comes down for a waiver for this gentleman where it's already too late. And it comes after his six months. And then we get a letter that he's not going to move into the city. And so then but today he shows some residence way past his six months. That's nothing personal against this guy. But, you know, I took an oath to follow the Home Rule Charter and the administrative code and every other code into it. And I just feel like that, you know, the ninth inning of a baseball game you don't change the rules and the fourth quarter of a football game you don't change the rules. I just feel I'm being played. And I don't appreciate how this whole process went down because it's not fair to everybody else who lives in the city and works in the city because they have to. Arbitration is another story. That was awarded to the police. That was done a different way, right. The rules are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 the rules. So I just wanted to give my take on what happened . And I'm not happy because like I said earlier , I'm a procedural process guy who votes on principle . All right. So with that said, next, so, Mr. Voldenberg , you know, there's an abandon ed car on Scranton Avenue. I've been -- brought it up twice. It's still there. I drove by on the way here. It's still there. I know it had a couple tickets three weeks ago. It's still there with a flat tire and it's still too close to the stop sign. So can we please follow up with that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And Joan Hodowanitz , you know, she brought up the issue with the -- I don't know what you call them, the boxes on each side of the crosswalk where you hit the button and, you know, you're able to give a lot of time to cross. If they're not working, that's a huge issue and I thank you for bringing that to our attention . Can we also look at that or have the department that handles that take a look at that. And in tandem with what you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 brought up about replacing streetlights with stop signs, I mean, I have the same issue you have with it, multiple issues, especially regarding the handicap how they're able to get across in time. Say you're in a wheelchair, say you're in a walker and also if you can't hear or see, this is a big issue. So like it was stated earlier and we're aware that this whole study has to come before us. So when it does I'll address this. You could count on it. All right. So next I have last week we've been talking about the -- God love Norma. She's been talking about street signs as long as I'm here. And so, you know, we got two pieces of information about amounts . And, you know, one was 125,290 and then one was the other -- the city was awarded the grant and thank you -- also thank you, Representative Donahue , for getting that for us because we really need it. And you're going to help -- help with this huge project . So when I asked, the first time I got, well, $125,000 is what we got. And then for the original sign project it's already 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 bided out. And then -- but I asked, well, what does the 300 -- so what does 333,000 get us in the way of signs because I wanted clarity for that. So I asked that again last week. So the answer I got for both amounts is the 125,290 covers the installation up to a thousand signs. That's great. So I think this is last years' project because the part B is 333,000 grant is a separate project that will be bid out. So let's see if that happens because it's a little confusing it's a bidding process because we're told we're not going to bid it out because we'd have the same -- so I don't know. We'll keep our eye on that. But it will be bid out in order to complete the West Scranton , Green Ridge and the Plot sections of the city. So that should probably get us another three -- I don't know, maybe 3,000 signs or close to that. So we'll keep our eye on that. We'll make sure it's bid out. We'll make sure this project continues because it's important for not just Norma but for everybody . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 All right. Also, I brought up -- and I got a response for a couple properties . So the demolition status I know that 929 was not on it. The question I asked is, okay, if it's not on it, where is this property at because I was told by a resident that it's supposed to come down for 10 years and it hasn't. So I don't know if they were doing a asbestos -- I forget what they do with the asbestos , not the abatement itself or was it the abatement or actual assessment I don't know or both. I didn't get that answer. All I got was the question again was combined with some others. May the city please advise demolition status on the condemned properties of 929 Monroe, R11 Blair -- Rear 111 Blair and Harrington Place. So what we got and the information we got back was demo questions will be answered after our next internal meeting. So I don't know when that takes place. So that information is still forthcoming . And I believe that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 The four-way stop sign request that we sent in for Sanderson Avenue and Deacon Street, I had asked the Mayor yesterday when I had a meeting with her if they would expedite that traffic study so that we could take from the table the rest of that legislation and move forward with it. Marie Schumacher had a request for the status and to revisit the condition of the temporary roadway on Seymour Avenue. The DPW is suppose d to go up and reassess it and look at it. Trash pickup for Les Spindler to clear near Redner's Market, DPW was notified of it and they said they would schedule a pickup of the trash. So and, Mr. Ellman, the parked cars on Main Avenue, we notified Corporal Iannuzzo and asked if the police department would do that area and cite the illegally parked cars and they said they would. So the unit block of South Webster Avenue the illegal business that's been operating there, the city did cite them. And they were notified of it. And I believe they cited them again. So it seems 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 they just think they are going to keep opening . But the city was there to cite them. The stormwater report, Mrs. Schumacher , that the city -- the Planning Commission did approve the land development on January 24th of 2024. So and then all the permits are in. The permit is in for the concrete . You could see it's underway up there for that building . And then you had requested , Mrs. Schumacher , again information for the sale of the Parking Authority and of the Sewer Authority sale. All of that information , there's over 2,000 pages, it's available and just contact Eileen Cipriani and you have access to that whenever you would like, okay? And then I have one more thing. With this -- the waivers for people coming down and the administration sending them down and the police department , the arbitration award for 144 police officers was given to their residenc y waiver. And as of today, our HR Department said there are 10 police officers that have used the waivers although there is 144 were given. So, Frank, I would just ask if you would ask the Law Department if everyone is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 going to continue to pay the earned income tax at the resident rate or as a nonresident rate so that we know everyone is paying the same amount. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question . MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all I have. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. King. MR. KING: Just one thing. I know that Mr. Mancini mention ed about the canine car. I believe that's Officer Benzaleski . Can you check with the police chief to find out if, in fact, the air conditioning in that canine car is not functioning and, if not, can we get that corrected ? That's -- I know that those dogs, especially they're trained -- and, you know, we don't want to see them in a situation as it's starting to get warmer. I just want to make sure that the vehicle is properly equipped for both the canine officer as well as the canine dog. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, sir. MR. KING: Thank you very much. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 98, 2023, AN ORDINANCE , AS AMENDED , ENTITLED “APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY , 2024 TO AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2024 BY THE ADOPTION OF THE GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2024,” (2024 OPERATING BUDGET) SO AS TO TRANSFER AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED FIFTY-ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TEN DOLLARS ($51,510) FROM THE BUREAU OF ADMINISTRATION OPER TSF—WORKER CO LINE ITEM ACCOUNT 100-44714-140-140-000000 TO FUND A POSITION OF EMPLOYMENT —PUBLIC SAFETY SPECIALIST —THAT WAS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE 2024 OPERATING BUDGET. MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 position here was identified last year. I thought we were going to be hearing about it going into this year's budget. It wasn't discussed at this year's budget. It came up again after this year's budget was passed. And I was under the impression that it would be included in budget discussions moving into next years. We find it in front of us tonight. And because it's due to public safety, I'm going to be in agreement with this. But I usually would not be in agreement with adding a new position or opening up our budget midyear. It should be something that's discussed during the budget process , especially because it was identified prior to right now. I know there's several open positions in the city. I've sent a request into the HR Department to get those open position s or position s that are not filled. Earlier I spoke about the pave cut inspector . We should have -- we have two pave cut inspectors in the budget. One of those position s is for $43,418. Rather than making a budget transfer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 to cover $51,000 it cost for this position , I think we should look at position s that are unfilled and not fill them for the remainder of the year. It's a good way to cover this money. And then we could discuss putting this into the budget for next year. That's just my opinion on this. Like I said, I will be for it because it's for public safety but offer a different way to fund the position . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Also on the question , so I was never -- for the most part would never agree to open a budget in the middle of the year and add a position whether it was on school board. It really hasn't happened here. Maybe it might have been recommended once or twice. But, like I said, I would never allow the budget to be open to add a position in the middle of the year that wasn't budgeted for, you know, without the funding allocated . But because it's public safety and the current climate -- no, look, I just got a text right now there's shots being fired over on Providence Road, you know what I mean? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 So this is a critical IT position that I spoke to the Chief about a few months ago because I heard from police officers that came to me and said, Mark, you know, we really need this technology . It's not getting fast enough into our cars in this system because we're waiting for the city's IT Department . So the police should not wait or be second waiting in line for essential technology that helps them to do their job and protect all of you and us. So with that said, like I said, I'm going to approve this. And I'll be happy to support the police and give them all the resources they need to, you know, keep themselves safe and all of you. MR. KING: On the question , I agree with the Council member Schuster as well as Mr. McAndrew . I'll be supporting this as well, especially since we did put into the budget two workers for the Parks and Rec that were suppose d to be dedicated toward cleaning up the downtown City of Scranton , the entrance ways into our city. Those are two positions that Council specifical ly asked for put in the budget. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 here it's April 9th. They haven't been hired yet. So all those -- I guess those funds right now that have gone unused. So the money from those two position s that haven't been filled I guess can go toward public safety. I'm fine with that but I still want to see the administration hire those two position s that City Council requested to help keep our downtown city and entrance ways into our city clean and to address all the issues with, you know, all the dirt and all the trash that surround our city to make sure that it's clean on a regular basis. And I'm still waiting for that to happen. But since we've gone almost three and a half of months with two position s that should have been paying people, that should more easily cover this position I would think. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I think there's several position s in the city that we could easily cover this position . Mr. Voldenberg , a few days ago when I saw this come onto our agenda, I requested from HR a list of those unfilled position s. I think Mr. Gilbride was also on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 some communication about those position s. If we could just follow up to see -- just stay on top of those that we could get what positions in the city are not filled at this point in time? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : And then the second thing is, the line item that this is coming from is OPERTSF worker CO. There is 2.6 million dollars in this line item in the business department or in the Business Administration . Can we just clarify what these funds are and what they're to be used for? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree as well with the addition of this position due to the critical nature and the need for, you know, the technology to be there for our officers in the police department . So I'll be voting in favor. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. And I also agree that this position -- this IT person will be dedicated just to the police and fire department . So I will be in favor of it also. All those in favor of introduction signify by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR.
