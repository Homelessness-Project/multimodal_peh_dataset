Let us think about them and their families at this time that they may find peace. Let us also think now about the doctors , the nurses, the researchers and all medical professionals and first responders who seek to heal and help those and who put themselves at risk in the process . May they find protection and peace, whether we are at home or abroad surrounded by many people suffering from this illness or only a few, let us stick together , endure together , mourn together , persist and prepare together . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 In place of our anxiety , let us continue to hope and find peace.
