Mr. Perry, do you have any comments at this time? MR. PERRY: Just very briefly , I just want to thank everyone for coming out and supporting us and supporting our city, that's very important and it's just always great to see such community involvement which the City of Scranton always has. I just want to send a special thank you out to my wife Lori. She is unable to attend today but I know she would really like to and my whole family for just the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 support . Anybody who is active in the community or in the public sector knows that your family is your backbone and you're only as strong as your family props you up to be and I know my family goes 110 percent for me. I also want to congratulate Councilman Donahue on the newest member to council . I'm looking forward to working with him and I know he is going to do a great job, and also congratulations to Mr. Gaughan and Mr. Rogan on their win as well. I'm excited to work again for the city for another two years to finish my term out and to get back to work with my new set of colleagues and let's get some stuff done. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , do you have any comments at this time? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just briefly . First off, I would like to just very thank my beautiful fiancee Mary Kate for continuing to always be standing by my side and for always supporting me 100 percent . I would not be sitting here today without an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 outstanding support system, so I must absolutely thank my family, especially my wonderful parents and all my friends that have been so support ive. I really can't thank you all enough. A couple of weeks ago I received a letter from the mayor. He congratulated me on my win, talked about his cooperate with council in his first term and that he looked forward to working with me. And to be completely honest with you, as I was reading through the letter I started to get a little angry. Not because I didn't appreciate the sentiment, but because nothing that was said in the letter couldn't have been done in a two-minute phone call. From Washington on down, government stopped working for the people because -- people in general , but especially politicians , talk at one another instead of talking with one another . Over the next four years as we exit distressed status, the decisions we are going to have to make are going to determine the course of this city for a generation . No one person will be able to do it alone. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 This must be a group effort from the mayor on down. We must be willing to talk to one another about the issues we face. I'm looking forward to working with the administration and the rest of the council to move this city in the right direction . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Evans, do you have any comments ? MR. EVANS: Yes. First of all, congratulations to Mr. Rogan and Mr. Perry in your elections to president and vice-president . I'm looking forward to working with both of you on your new positions on city council . We have had a very good relationship in the past and I continue to hope that we have the same professional path under your leadership that we enjoyed under Council President McGoff and Council President Wechsler . I would like to welcome Councilman Gaughan and formally congratulate him on his second term on city council . Mr. Gaughan and I have a very good working relationship and I have the utmost respect for him and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 what he has tried to accomplish while he is on city council . He is the very definition of a prepared , conscientious and independent councilman . So, Bill, good luck on act two. And, finally, I would like to welcome incoming city councilman Kyle Donahue . To say I have known Kyle all of his life would certainly be accurate . One of my first and childhood friends and best friends was Kyle's aunt Mary Ellen, and one of my longest and dearest friends is Kyle's uncle, retired marine colonel Charles Chuck Rushworth , who is here today with his beautiful wife Robin. So, Kyle, I know your aunts and uncles, friends and family, are very proud of the person, the young man you have become. Especially your parents , Danny and Beth and, of course, Mary Kate. I wish you only the best and I know you will effective , caring and a visionary councilman . So, again, all the best and thank you for joining us on Scranton City Council . That's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 comments at this time? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First of all, I'd like to wish everybody a happy new year and thank you for being here on this frigid January 1. I'd like to start off by thanking my very good friend, Judge Tom Munley, for swearing me in and I want to recognize some of the dignitaries and officials in the audience today. Mayor Connors is here with us today. Mayor Peters, Commissioner Pat O'Malley and Councilman John Pocius, so thank you very much for coming today. I would like to congratulate Councilman Rogan on becoming our new president and on his victory for city council . I also want to congratulate Kyle Donahue on his victory . I'm looking forward to working with them over the next four years along with Councilman Evans and Councilman Perry and I want to congratulate him on becoming vice-president . I'd also like to congratulate our solicitor , Amil Minora, and Lori Reed and I look forward to working on them the next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 four years. I also want to congratulate Mayor Courtright on his reelection and I am looking forward to working very closely with him as well. I am extremely honored to be able to serve the people of the City of Scranton for another four years. It's my strong belief, and it always has been, that public service is an obligation and a responsibility . It's important that we as citizens give back to our community , that we become involved in government and in civic affairs . Many people shy away from public service , even speaking up on an important issues because of the scrutiny and criticism that sometimes comes along with it. I'm reminded of what Aristotle once said, "To avoid criticism , say nothing , do nothing , be nothing ." Now, more than ever, we need young people to get involved in public service , run for office and make a difference . Everyone in these chambers today understands the sacrifices that comes along with running for public office and being involved . It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 impossible to do it alone. I am extremely blessed and extremely grateful to my family and friends who worked so hard on my campaign for election and believe in me every step of the way and I have so many people to thank. First of all, I'd like to thank my wife Kelly, I don't think she is in room now, she is chasing around a two-year-old and a one-year-old. I would consider her at this point after the last two years with two children to be a saint really. She is the wonderful mother of our two sons Jack and Murphy. To say our life has been an adventure since we met seven years ago would be a major understatement and I think she would agree with me if she was in the room. Kelly has stuck by side through it all even -- and I wanted to apologize in the beginning , I wasn't here the last two council meeting s because I had my appendix out and she would be sick if I told the story again because everybody I run into I'm telling them about getting my appendix out, but I wanted to apologize for being absent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 and thank her for being the best nurse in the City of Scranton . So I can't thank her enough and I love her dearly. I want to thank my parents , Jack and Marie, who are with us today, I am so proud to have you as my parents . You are always there when I need you, I can't thank you enough. I want to thank my brothers Eddie and Jackie. My sisters Katie and Kelly. I want to thank all of my aunts and uncles. Working the polls, walking door to door. My Uncle John walked I think every street in South Side with me, and he complained about walking up all the hills, by the way. Making phone calls, making baskets for parties , there is a lot that goes into being and getting elected to office and they really helped me out. I want to thank all of my cousins, my sister-in-law, Keri Cruser, for all her hard work on my campains and I want to send a special thank you to my father-in-law and mother-in-law Jim and Mari Wright, who are here with us today, always on baby duty during campaign events, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 appreciate that and I want to send a special thank you to my wife's grandmother , Mary McLane. She couldn't be here today, but she was always heavily involved in politics and Democratic politics and she worked hard for me when I first go started and she really is a class act, so I wanted to thank her for that. And I also wanted to thank all of of the volunteers who stepped forward and helped me get elected . I also want to take a moment to remember my grandparents who couldn't be here with us today either, Elizabeth and Bill Gaughan and Edward and Helen Trentley , and I have to say something special about my Grandma Trentley because she was here with us four years ago when I first got elected . She was also involved in Democratic politics from the time she was a little girl until she passed away really, and she was not afraid to take a stand and that's one thing that she always taught me, that those who stand for nothing fall for anything and her father Edward was involved in politics as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 well. He ran for city council , he ran for sheriff , he didn't get elected to any of those things, but he took a stand for the people of South Side and I think that's where what I learned from going up her house and talking with her often, so I wish she could be here and I know she is here with us today. Finally , I want to thank the people of Scranton for putting their faith in me. I have met so many great families over the last four years. Really hardworking , blue collar, salt of the earth men and women who want nothing more than a fair shake, nothing more than to be able to put food on the table for their families , and it really has been one of the great honors of my life to be able to try and help them the best I can to speak from these chambers on their behalf when often times they feel like they don't have a voice. Their problems , their neighborhood issues, their concerns and their worries have become mine and that will never change. I can promise you this morning that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 I will continue to fight for you, stand up for you, ask the tough questions of those in position s of power and demand decisions that this administration makes over the next four years are done out in the open and not behind closed doors. Scranton , like many other cities throughout the country , faces many challenges and it would be very easy for our leaders to shy away from them, to blame somebody else for them and to pretend that they do not exist. Washington Irving once said, "Little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune , but great minds rise above it." We must not shy away from these challenges . We must meet them head on and recognize the opportunities that they present . I am very hopeful that Mayor Courtright and his administration will work closely with this council over the next four years to meet these challenges and to make Scranton a progressive , proactive city with is transparent and works for all of the people. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, everybody . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I'd like to first start off by thanking by colleagues for selecting me as council president . This has been a long road. I have been on council a number of years now. My journey started about 10 years ago, my first election . Unfortunately , I came up a little bit short but the two people that I lost to one was Bob McGoff, who was one of the best council people the city has ever had, and the other is our mayor, Bill Courtright . So coming in third to those two individuals isn't the worst thing in the world. I would like to congratulate Councilman Gaughan on his reelection . Congratulate Council Donahue on his election . Congratulate Councilman Perry on becoming vice-president , and not to leave out Mr. Evans, but we are thrilled you are here with us as well for another two years. Running for office and being in office is something a lot more difficult than what you say see on TV during one or or weekly meetings . There is much more that goes into it. It's a 24/7 job and it's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 something that I take lightly . I do want to thank a few people. I have to thank my beautiful wife Amanda who stood by me during the entire campaign , hasn't seen me much during the campaign because it's so stressful and lot of work. Also, I'd like to thank my mom, who has been by side the entire time. Even though neither my mom or my wife care for politics too much they help me and they do it because it's something I truly care about and care about for the city so I want to thank them for their support . I would like to thank the residents of the Scranton for giving me the privilege to serve them for a third time. Third terms in politics are extremely rare so it's something that I'm very humbled to have that honor of. Over the next four years there are a lot of challenges that the city faces, but I want to take a minute to thank outgoing Council President Joe Wechsler for his leadership through the years, and Council President Bob McGoff, who is no longer with us, and if it wasn't for those two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 individuals we wouldn't have the opportunity that we have today to do a lot of the proactive things we are going to do in these next couple of years to help benefit the City of Scranton . Over the next two years as I serve as council president my focus is going to be on continuing the legacy that city council has had over the last four years and now that we have finally got ourself in a financially position where we are not constantly trying to correct the mistakes of the past to lead some proactive endeavors to help the business community and help grow our city, create family sustaining jobs, help our neighbor hoods. Basic services are what people come to city government for and that's our responsibility to deliver those services to the residents of Scranton . So I just once again would like to thank my colleagues for selecting me as president and especially to the voters for giving me the honor of a third term of being your city council man so thank you. I now ask Father Ferreti to come 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 forward again and to offer the benediction . (Father Sam Ferretti gives the benediction .) MR. ROGAN: If there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. PERRY: Motion to adjourn . MR. ROGAN: Our next regularly scheduled meeting will held on Monday, January 8, at 6:00 p.m. This meeting is adjourned . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 #### 29 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes of testimony taken by me at the hearing of the above-captioned matter and that the foregoing is a true and correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
