Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Bob Bolus spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Jay Walsh spoke on matters of general concern . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on city business .) MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Just a couple of quick things. In the last couple of weeks I have been talking to some neighbors of the mission house, I know they were here in December and they were having some issues with just some bad activity around their neighbor hood so if we could, Mrs. Reed, could we send another letter to Chief Graziano to see if he had a plan or if he was able to do a step up of police presence in that area from time to time based on all of that information that we sent out in the original e-mail? And, also, I don't believe we heard back from Mr. Hinton on our request to see -- to make sure that the mission house 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 was operating in full compliance and while the mission house and other facilities like that are needed in the city, it's also a responsibility of not only us but the facilities themselves to run it correctly and that's what we are trying to do here. We are just trying to make this a win-win. We want the people in the mission house to get all of the help they need whenever they need it, but at the same time be respectful to the community that these places are in and that's kind of what we are trying to go for right here. Also, Mrs. Schumacher brought up the rescheduling meeting of Chief Graziano . I did have something I would like to add to that but I know it will be a good a chance, we'll have the chief and the D.A. in the same room. I would like them to bring their opinion on the decriminalization of marijuana and if they have one much. It's something that's been talked about recently , it's been something that's been brought up in the past and it's been something that is done in other cities, so I want to just hear 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 from them. They are the two biggest players in this and it really doesn't happen without their backing and their -- I want them to bring them experience to the table because if there is any two people in the city that have the best of the best insight on that issue it would be Chief Graziano and D.A. Powell. Lastly, there is an issue that we have been dealing with for awhile on Ferdinand Street and Church Avenue, it's just standing water that's been happening and the residents there are happy that the drain and the sewage issue was fixed with the cleaning out, but we did send a letter way back when to DPW and it was a milling issue and it wasn't going to happen this year -- or in 2018, it just 2018 books were closed on all paving. I just want to see if that was planned to get on this year's budget or if it's not would it be included and would it need a full scope of road paving. It's just basically some milling and some repaving to fix the pitch of that street in order to run the water correctly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 into the storm drain and then if we can get a response back if that's the case I don't know it's going to need something from the engineering department or if it's just a simple fix, but if we can get answers to that I would appreciate it. That's all I have today. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just a couple of things. Just to respond to a couple things Marie brought up real quick. With regards to recycling , I think the problem there is you have the same operator that runs the recycling center that runs the landfill so it doesn't provide any incentive to the operator to recycle more recyclables so I think that needs to change moving forward , we need to figure out ways for that to change. With regards to the mayor, I have called on him multiple times to make a statement and he still hasn't done that so I agree with you 100 percent on that, too. Mrs. Reed, I have gotten a couple of calls 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 about potholes on the bottom of East Mountain Road and Wintermantle Avenue so would we be able to pass that along to DPW to maybe go up there and patch them up? Myself and Councilman Evans had a meeting with PennDOT on Friday regarding the intersection of Pittston Avenue and Orchard Street, hopefully we could come to an amicable agreement on that corner because it is a pretty dangerous intersection according to a lot of the data that the chief brought along with him. Also, I had a couple of calls about issues with speed of cars coming off Boulevard Avenue onto Columbia Street in front of Robert Morris so would you be able to pass that along to Chief Graziano ? And just to agree with Councilman Perry, I really do think it's time to have a discussion with the D.A. and the chief about marijuana decriminalization . I think there is valid points on both sides, but I think it would be valuable to have that discussion . That's all I have tonight . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MS. EVANS: Very briefly . On the decriminal ization of marijuana , I have been calling for that meeting for quite awhile so I'm very encourage d by the conversation tonight so hopefully Chief Graziano and D.A. Powell will be able to prepared for that discussion as well. I would like to announce that we will be holding a work session next Tuesday evening at 6:00 p.m. in city council chambers to discuss the results of the Blight Task Force. We will go over the multi-faceted plan with a goal to implementation on many of the strategies developed at those meeting s. So, again, we will be meeting in council chambers Tuesday , February 19, at 6:00 p.m. for that work session . And that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Just two brief items. The homelessness was brought up, and I did receive a memorandum from the mayor. This meeting was taking place -- the timing kind of got thrown off from some of our meetings with a couple of items getting changed , but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 it's been reported that there currently isn't a shelter in the city when it gets cold because of a couple of shelters did close so this memorandum states that Weston Field will be available for use as a homeless shelter by Keystone Mission in adverse weather condition s when the temperature is below 15 degrees and when they anticipate having to shelter 20 or more individuals . The facilities will be open for the Keystone Mission from 9 p.m. until 7 a.m. The Keystone Mission will be required to have adequate staff on hand for the entire duration of the stay and the rules, regulations for the mission will be implement ed and enforced . Following the departure of shelter guests, Director Fallon will have his staff and rec staff clean the gymnasium and restrooms so that was just part of an update on this ongoing issue that's going on as well. And, secondly , I just want to mention we did receive this flyer from Neighbor Works which is one of the best organizations we have in our city for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 helping homeowners and this program particularly for homeowners who are 60 and older, modest income who need a helping hand. This summer between June 24 and 28 volunteer groups will be working in the city on projects , again, at no cost such as porch repair and construction , steps repairs, interior and exterior painting , solar power security lights, weatherization and wheelchair ramp repair or construction . As I mention ed it's for older homeowners , 60 or older. For a one-person household the income limit is around $37,000. For a two-person household it's $42,500 and for a three-person household it's $47,750. The deadline to apply is March 15, so anyone who is interested in applying for this program if they need some -- if they are older and need some work done on their house free of charge you can contact the Lackawanna County Area Agency on Aging at 570-963-6740 and request a Neighbor Works referral for the summer of 2019 project . And I do want to give a thank you to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Neighbor Works, they have been one of the best partners that the city has in our county in helping people achieve homeowner ship through the program that Councilman Evans and myself put together and also for those who are older who want to remain in their homes, adaptions for people who are older but need, you know, a helping hand, need ramps put in, need, you know, different lifts, and they have been a great asset and Scranton has a very large population of senior citizens so anyone that's out there that needs a little help on their home if you are over 60 and you meet these income guidelines please get in touch with the Area Agency on Aging or Neighbor Works. And that is it all. MS. REED: 5-B.
