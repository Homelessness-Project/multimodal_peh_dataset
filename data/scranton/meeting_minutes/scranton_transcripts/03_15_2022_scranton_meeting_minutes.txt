MR. DONAHUE : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community . Please keep those fighting for liberty and democracy in Ukraine in your thoughts this evening . Thank you. Roll call. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Present . MR. KING: Mr. President , at this time, I would like to make a motion to reconsider two resolutions that were defeated last week in my absence due to a work commitment . The first one would be 5-I, a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 resolution to accept $50,000 from Lackawanna College to hire a finance director . Second one would be 5-J, resolution to repurpose $50,000 from the Willary Foundation to be used to hire a finance director . And the reasons why I support reconsidering these resolutions are the following : There's -- there would be zero impact on the 2022 City budget. We're not going to be paying any benefits whatsoever . Number two, there will be no legacy costs associated with accepting this $100,000 for this position . Number three, the fact that the City just exited Act 47 distressed status after 30 years. And I think it would help support the City administration as we transition out of distressed status this year. It will also allow the City to evaluate the effectiveness of the finance director position to determine whether it is needed in future years. And also I believe by accepting these funds, it will go a long way to prove to our creditors that we are serious about making wise financial decision s moving the City forward in a positive direction . So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 that's why I'm asking the Council to reconsider these two resolution s. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor. Is there a second? DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm in agreement with Councilman King and the reasons that he set for support ing these two pieces of legislation similar to reasons I provided last week. I also believe that because we're coming out of Act 47, it will be helpful for to us have this position of finance director. And then we can reevaluate what that person has accomplished and how much they've helped us towards the end of the year and see whether or not it's something that should go into the budget at that time. But right now there is not really a down side for me. I don't see why we couldn't accept this help. And I'm interested in Scranton 's financial future, our sustain ability of our finances . And I think that this is a way to get there. So that's why I am in favor of this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 motion. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I'm not in favor of this motion for reasons I mentioned last week. But in addition to that, for this resolution , the legislation cover sheet states that the City of Scranton financial director continuity and build internally capacity after 30 years of technical assistance provided by the Commonwealth via PEL. But guess what? PEL is not leaving . They're coming back. So that was another resolution I voted against a couple weeks ago. So I don't understand . The main reason to get the financial director is because of the absence of PEL. But PEL is coming back, folks. So I don't know how many people they need to run that office. I think like I said in previous weeks, we need to stand on or own and prove that, you know, we've exited Act 47 and are able to do the job. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. SCHUSTER : I guess I might as well speak on the question now. So last week I did vote against this -- several issues that I stated actually during the budget process and even more recently . We're working around the formal budget process by accepting independent funding. We're circumventing the oversight of Council with this. And, I mean, it's a slippery slope with the independent funding . The argument that we're not allowing the administration the resources I feel is untrue. We currently have several people in the Business Office. We have a BA. We have a finance manager . We have two assistants, an account ant, a project 's manager . And we also have third party contract s for fees, consultan ts, and we have PFM as our financial advisor , not to mention that this year we're also going out for grant funding to keep PEL on for an additional year. So I think with all of these services and some of the comment s I made in the past, I've stated my reasoning for this. We still have not been given how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 this position is going to be funded going into next year. I do understand the other Council persons ' decision s and opinions and I've stated my own. MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I'm in favor of this. I do believe we need to have capacity across City government . I think we've been short-staffed for way too long on multiple different levels. And at the end of the day, you know, we're not -- this isn't coming out of the City's general fund. And we, you know, I'm assuming going forward this is going to be proposed in the budget. But then at least we have a working product to judge that position on. And I think we could use that grant funding to do that. All those in favor of the motion to reconsideration 5-I and 5-J signify by saying aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Nays? MR. SCHUSTER : Nay. MR. MCANDREW : Nay. MR. DONAHUE : The ayes have it and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 so moved. Mr. Voldenberg , please dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3-A. INDEPENDENT AUDITOR ’S REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE SCRANTON SEWER AUTHORITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 PREPARED BY JOSEPH M. ALU & ASSOCIATES , P.C. 3-B. MINUTES OF THE SHADE TREE COMMISSION MEETING HELD SEPTEMBER 21, 2021. 3-C. INDEPENDENT AUDITORS ’ REPORT FOR YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2020 PREPARED BY KOHANSKI & COMPANY , PC. 3-D. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED MARCH 14, 2022 FROM OECD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REGARDING ARPA ELIGIBLE CATEGORIES . MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So next week over in West Side, St. Lucy's Parish wants you to save the date. They'll be holding their spaghetti dinner on Wednesday , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 March 30th and Thursday , March 31st. When? Dinners will be served between 5 and 8 p.m. Takeouts are at 3 to 5 p.m. Where, the church auditorium at 949 Scranton Street, Scranton , PA 18504. The cost is $14 and tickets are available at the door. That is all I have. Thanks. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Does anyone else have any announcement s? MR. KING: I'm not sure if you're going to mention something , Mr. Donahue , about the parade on Saturday . As everyone knows, we had a massive storm last Saturday which postponed St. Patrick 's Day Parade. That will now be held this Saturday , March 19th. The festivities will begin at 10 a.m. with the mass at St. Peter's Cathedral followed by a 2 mile Brian Kelly road race which will start from Cultural Center and run down to the St. Peter's Cathedral and come back to the Cultural Center. And that is at 11 a.m. And the parade will kick off at 11:45 a.m. It will be broadcast on WBRE. I know there's supposed to be maybe a little rain. But we're hoping that sunshine will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 actually come out this time. And I just want everyone -- I look forward to seeing everyone on the streets of Scranton on Saturday to celebrate St. Patrick 's Day. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, anyone else have any announcement ? I was just going to mention that and bring up the police announcement that I did last week. Unfortunately , we had to reschedule the 2022 St. Patrick 's Day Parade. But the parade does begin at 11:45 in front of St. Peter's Cathedral . The Scranton Police Department will be closing several streets in downtown Scranton at 9:30 a.m. for the parade. There will be no on-street parking in the area between Penn Avenue and Jefferson Avenue and Lackawanna Avenue and Vine Street. The Scranton Police Department and its law enforcement partners will be conducting a full spectrum of operation s to ensure the safety of all persons at the event. The officers will have a zero tolerance policy for any public intoxication , open containers , mischief , disorderly conduct , or any other criminal conduct . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 We're asking that if any persons do see any suspicious activity to contact 911 so our officers can investigate . Drones will not be permitted to be flown over the parade or staging areas. SPD also asked that if you're going to be drinking alcohol , please drink responsibly and have a designated driver or use public transportation , taxi, Uber or Lyft to travel home safely. They also want to remind you to gain access to the Marketplace at Steamtown , you will have to enter through the westerly side of the Marketplace near the bus terminal . Another announcement I have tonight I do want to acknowledge that today is Equal Payday. It's a day that represent s how far into 2022 women have to work to earn what a man did in 2021. Right now women make about 83 cents on the dollar for every dollar a man makes. And in 2022 that's just not conscionable . So I do urge -- I would like to urge -- Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to put an end to that practice and make the statement that equal pay for equal work is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 right and just thing to do. And that's all I have. MR. KING: Mr. Donahue , I have one more announcement . I'm President of Shamrock Heart Foundation . And we have volunteer s that worked today. And they're going to be working tomorrow putting together corsages and flowers for the elderly. And on St. Patrick 's Day, March 17th in the morning , we're going to be deliver ing those flowers to all the elderly at the local nursing homes and the hospital . That is something that was begun by Attorney John McGee over 30 years ago. And he asked me to get involved a few years ago. It's a great organization . And it really helps to put a smile on the face of the elderly on St. Patrick 's Day when they receive those corsages and those green flowers on St. Patrick 's Day. So I want to thank all the many volunteers . There's approximately 50 to 60 volunteers that help put those together and then deliver them to the nursing homes and to the hospital s. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. King. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 I'll be out bright and early on Thursday morning delivering them. Anyone else have any announcements ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . With regard to the 2020 audit, I remind you that Section 213 of the Home Rule Charter requires City Council to publish a summary of fiscal affairs in the newspaper . So I keep looking for that in the legals. I don't think it was done last year. If it was, I missed it. Next, the union contracts , still in negotiation ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : This is day 74 of the year 2022, which means 20 percent of the year is gone. Now, I personally believe that the unions are going to be looking for a significant pay increase considering what's going on with inflations and most economists think that inflation 's going to go up rather than down before the end of the year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 The longer negotiations and possibly arbitration go on, the greater impact it's going to have on the 2022 budget because I would assume that any pay raise would be retroactive to January 1st. But if nothing else, I hope during negotiations they change the end date of the contract . I think it would be far better for the union contract s to expire on June 30th rather than on December 31st. That gives the City an opportunity in case they need to go into associations that you're not running into the next fiscal year. Hopefully they'll change that. On March 22nd one week from today, who will be the City Treasurer ? MR. DONAHUE : That is to be determined . MS. HODOWANITZ : Hopefully by next week. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Also, any chance that they will resurrect the database on real estate taxes and the refuse fees? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, so the acting treasurer advised on March 8th the data related 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 to individual properties and the database and search function on the City's website was outdated and will reinstall this feature once the updated information is received from Portnoff and the Tax Claim Bureau. MS. HODOWANITZ : That's great because you could have looked up the Murray Building and the (inaudible ) building and seen, you know, what their tax for the City was. I told Alex Hazzouri that one thing to consider is, he's looking at potentiall y 55 employees downtown . Those people are going to be paying wage tax and LST tax. So that may well offset any loss in property taxes. So it may turn out to be a win/win. 5-C and 5-D, the grants for the parks, I think half million dollars for I think Robinson and 155 for Oakmont or vice versa, that's total of $655,000 up to that amount with a 50 percent match by the City which would be as much as $327,500. Now the capital budget for 2022 has earmarked 1 million dollars for all the City parks. I don't know how many there are 15, 16, something like that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. DONAHUE : There's almost 34, 35. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, my point is it would be nice to see a layout of how you're going to apportion that 1 million dollars capital budget for these various parks. We keep going in for grants with an up to figure, we don't want to overextend ourselves. MR. DONAHUE : Just a reminder too, that ARPA money could be -- in certain situations could be used for grants. But we are going to get into that in the next couple weeks. MS. HODOWANITZ : Good. I want to thank Mr. Voldenberg for giving me the Sewer Authority audit. It runs through March 31st, 2020, which means the data is almost two years old that from our Sewer Authority as I like to call them the municipal authority that would not die. I also saw on the City's website the audit for the Single Tax Office for 2019 and 2020. You might want to add that to your Third Order. They have one finding. It wasn't material . It was significant . And let's see. And I'm very happy to see someone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 wants to resurrect the Brook's mine at Nay Aug Park. I used to go there when I was child. And if that's not going to cost the City anything , I think that's a wonderful proposal . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . I came tonight especially to thank the DPW and all the guys that work for them for the phenomenal job they did this past weekend with the terrible storm and the 40 mile an hour winds. They were out there all day long salting East Mountain , West Mountain . My daughter lives in West Mountain . My sister lives in East Mountain . Everything was taken care of. I can't thank them enough. Everybody got to go where they had to go. It was treacherous but because they cleaned the streets, everybody got to go where they had to go. I know you often complain about overtime. But these storms -- I think every one of these storms happened every weekend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 except for two since January . We have no control over when the storm is coming. I suggest maybe you put more money in the budget for overtime then because you can't control the weather . But thanking these guys goes a long way. It brings up their morale. So it would be nice if you guys thanked them. Another thing, I just heard you saying that you want to introduce or reintroduce the financial position from last week for the grants. You know, I was surprised last week that you did not know that when you got a tie the vote failed. Now you're going to reintroduce something . I don't think it's legal. So I don't think you should even venture into this until you check to see if it's legal. I think you have to have 24-hour notice. I think you should check the law before you go ahead with doing this because once you do it, you may be doing it illegal ly and then what are you going to do? So I think you better think twice before you vote on this. MR. DONAHUE : Section 10 of our rules allows for reconsideration . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 MS. FRANUS: Pardon me? MR. DONAHUE : Section 10 of Council 's rules allows for reconsideration of any motion by a majority of Council . MS. FRANUS: Okay. I'm just saying just fair warning . I think you might think twice about it. Another thing, are you going to have PEL consult with you about the finances ? MR. DONAHUE : We're still waiting to hear on whether or not we accepted -- or whether we were rewarded a grant. We applied for the grant. We haven't been awarded the grant yet. MS. FRANUS: To pay for PEL? MR. DONAHUE : That would be to get services similar to PEL. I believe a bid would have to go out for that, yes. MS. FRANUS: Well, I'm just saying, I don't think you should ever consult with PEL. They're the ones that kept us distress ed for all of those years, they and Mr. Doherty . They kept us distressed . Why you'd even go near them is crazy. They did not help us. They hurt us. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Another thing, Mr. Donahue , last week you told me in a letter that the grant for $100,000 by Dunmore Oil for the building over there at 524 Penn Avenue, something about revitalization for Pine Brook. That's not even in Pine Brook. It's three or four blocks away from Pine Brook. So that's a lie right there. But you said that the people that approve -- went to get the grant are the ones that have to put up the money to match it. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. FRANUS: Yes? That's right? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. FRANUS: So the Catholic church owns it. So why did Dunmore Oil put up $100,000? MR. DONAHUE : I have no idea but it's being matched . MS. FRANUS: Pardon me? MR. DONAHUE : It's being matched -- MS. FRANUS: -- asked for the grant by law. You said to me in an e-mail the person that applies for the grant must come up with the money. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. DONAHUE : Yes. And I misspoke there because I thought Dunmore Oil still owned the property . But I was mistaken . MS. FRANUS: Well, they don't. MR. DONAHUE : I know. I was mistaken . MS. FRANUS: Dunmore Oil sold it to them for a dollar, Catholic church in 2013. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. FRANUS: So Dunmore Oil does not own it. But yet, they come up with the grant. So how do you vote for something like that when it's not right? MR. DONAHUE : There's no City money. And all it is is applying for the grant. It's not even accepting a grant. It's applying for a grant. MS. FRANUS: Well, then you shouldn 't say what you say about the people that own it have to come up with the money. Another thing, Mr. King, I was here two weeks ago and talked about the garbage fee how any of the money coming in from the garbage fee should not go into the general fund. Did you check that at all? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 I've been doing this for 10 years now. Nobody's come forward and straightened this out. The money from the garbage fee should not be going into the general fund for any bills. They only go in for the distribution of the expense s of the DPW. This year they got 8 million dollars -- like, 8,120,000 from the property tax fee -- the garbage fee this year. Two years ago when people didn't put it in the property tax, they only got 6 million. So there's 2 million dollars extra probably go into the general fund to pay the City bills which is illegal . Go look at the Administrative Code, Mr. King. Next week or whenever I come back, I want you to have all the information about is there a separate account for the garbage fee from this -- from the money coming in for the garbage fee at the DPW and not in the general fund. You're in charge of DPW, are you not? MR. KING: I'm the Chair for that. MS. FRANUS: Okay. Will you please check into that for me and get some answers ? MR. KING: Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MS. FRANUS: Mr. King? MR. KING: Yes, I will. MS. FRANUS: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries . I'm a Scranton resident . It was good the way that you started the meeting off tonight because what I was going to be talking about is the Resolution 5-B. Last week as the Resolution 5-B was discussed I was a little disappoint ed by the results . I am not a financial wizard. And I do not -- I have trouble enough keeping track of my own budget. So listening to the budget numbers and things, that's something that's out of my league. So I rely on you guys up there sitting at the podium to advise us citizen s of Scranton as to what is best for us. But when you voted down the resolution last week, it did not sit well with me. And I thought about it all week and I thought about it all week. And I said why is this -- why would you turn down money that's a free gift? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I thought about my own budget and growing up with my kids and my husband . And we made our budget. We always lived by a budget. And if there were things that were in the budget that we thought , you know, we need to scratch this or the kids needed some sports equipment , we'd scratched that. Then the boys would say, well, mom, I'll make some extra money because I'll go out and cut grass or do whatever to take care of that item because I want it. My husband would say, well, maybe we'll work some overtime to make up for that item that we can't afford in our budget right now. So I started to think that way about the items that you crossed off and why it wasn't voted on. You were given money. You were granted money to handle a financial director , a financial director that I'm hoping that as the resumes came in, you would pick and select the one with the best skills and qualifications for the position . So, you know, as I thought about it, I went back and I read and listened to Council again on YouTube just to make sure that I heard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 everything correctly as I was sitting in the audience and I did. One of the things that was said about the money could be better used for the neighborhoods . The neighborhoods , that's always a hot button with every citizen of Scranton . We all want our neighborhood s to be the best neighborhoods that they could be. But as I thought about what's going on in the City, West Side is going through a revitalization . South Side is going to have a revitalization . Out at the Pine Brook section of our City is going to be going through a revitalization . Then in the, you know, our little bulletin today, it's talking about the different parks that money and grants are going to be coming to revitalize those as well. So there's a lot of money out there to help our neighborhood s. And we want our neighborhood s to be the best that they could be. But I also know that having a good financial director could also help us get there. That financial director will be able to look at the bills and look at the monies that are coming in.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 We're just getting out of Act 47. I don't understand all that went on with Act 47. But it's a good thing for the City. So to have a good financial director to help us get through that is something that's going benefit us all, not only me or you sitting here but also the neighborhoods and to give the neighborhoods the best, best that they could be. So I was glad that the meeting started off tonight with a reconsideration of Resolution 5-B and I thank you for that. I started to think as you were talking , I said, well, gee, there's no sense in me talking tonight because everything that I wanted to say was said tonight . So I thank you for that. I have another meeting that I have to get to so, you know, I'm glad I was able to get up and tell you my thought s and concerns about the City of Scranton . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And, Norma, since you have to leave, the street sign on North Webster Avenue was replaced today. MS. JEFFRIES : Excellent . I'm going to check it out tomorrow morning . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. Next on the list is Scott Thomas from the Scranton Public Library . MR. THOMAS: Hi, I'm Scott Thomas, CEO of the Scranton Public Library . And the library needs your help. I received some information from PennDOT basically saying that two years ago the City receive d a Green to Go grant to replace the streetlight that's at the intersection of Wyoming Avenue and Green Ridge Street and also to upgrade the crosswalks . But nothing was ever done with that. And we have a branch there. And it's a concern always about the traffic speeding through there and people getting out of cars with kids and stroller s and things like that. And we're also planning to upgrade that branch to make it handicap ped accessible. And that's also going to increase usage of it. So I was hoping that you could kind of look into why nothing was ever done with that and whether we can still push it forward because we need to do something with that. I have document ation. Should I give it to you? Okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, we'll look into that. I absolutely remember applying for that grant and the fact that it was awarded . So we'll look into that and get back to you. MR. THOMAS: Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. Next on the list is Rick Little. MR. LITTLE: Hi. I'd like to talk about Scranton public housing where I live. There seems to be a problem between the county and the City. Scranton public housing is the lynchpin for all federal , state, and county funds coming in. And yet, there's no attention to it. The people that run it are chosen by the City of Scranton . Yet the people that are there say that it's their building . For about 30 years the -- the police have no jurisdiction there apparently . And neither does the Scranton Code Enforcement even though they pretend to be. I have for at least six years trying to get to the bottom of this. I was informed by Mayor Paige Cognetti to speak -- to call 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 311, which I did. I spoke with to a guy named Chris Smith who is supposedly the head of it. I gave him a whole bunch of papers about what's going on over at 420 Adams High Rise. He hasn't gotten back to me in over six months. And it's a problem because they're abusing the elderly , not only in my building but across the City. I could see that clear as day. I'm in the middle of eviction proceeding s. But they confiscated all of my most precious property , pictures of my kids. I'm a filmmaker. My life's work in film was in their storage rental unit. And they just broke my lock, moved it from one locked room to another room. And no one is -- no one there talks to me. And so I went from there -- I went right up the ranks all the way to Mr. Picalucci (phonetic ) who runs it. After speaking with Karl Lynott, after speaking with Debbie Leteri(phonetic ) and there is just no communication , no communication . And I find people from the county saying, well, you just can't get along with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 manager . And, you know, who's really your landlord? I want to know who my landlord is and what the City of Scranton has to do with it because I know the history of Scranton Housing Authority where one mayor, Mayor Durkin I believe it was from 1922 to 1975 was head of Scranton Housing Authority even when it became corporatized in 1939. But since like 1986, the same little group has run it. Their lawyer is the District Attorney for the City. So he has the cops in their pockets so they could rob me. And I called the police. And I filled out a police report. And the police report always says -- even if I manage to get it filled out right because they constantly have, you know, misspell my name, don't write my apartment number. And then I have to go to the police department and correct it. But even so, they say speak to your building 's manager . This doesn't happen in any other landlord tenant thing. And then I go before the magistrate judge and I immediately get evicted , no pay to stay.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 And this is after they've confiscated my stuff for two years, four months. I have not been able to get to my stuff. And they -- and there's no respect breaking into my apartment all the time. I've had no maintenance for four years. I'm on the bad end of the stick of the people that run this Scranton Housing Authority . I need to find out somebody from Scranton who knows about Scranton Housing Authority . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Little. Would you be able to leave your contact information with Miss Carrera here and we'll see what we can find out for you. MR. LITTLE: I could assure you that Chris Smith has it. MR. DONAHUE : Okay, but just so we can get back to you, can you just leave your contact information and we can see what we can find out for you? MS. SCHUSTER : Actually , Mr. Little, I have the contact information . I'll give you a call afterwards . MR. LITTLE: I didn't hear you. MR. SCHUSTER : I have your contact 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 information . I'm going to give you a call afterwards . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I'd like to start off tonight by thanking Kyle Donahue for getting the ARP expenditure categories put into the Third Order today. But, of course, that begs the question of what's happened to the survey for the people to designate now that we know what the categories are. MR. DONAHUE : So that's going online tomorrow . MS. SCHUMACHER : Say what? MR. DONAHUE : That's going -- it will be up on the website tomorrow . And I'm sure we'll address it more in Fifth Order. MS. SCHUMACHER : And how's it going to be marketed ? How are people going to know it's there? MR. DONAHUE : I'll look into that, yeah. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. That's good news. On 5-B, I was concerned when there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 was information in the backup about this company working with the ARPA master plan. I didn't even know we had an ARPA master plan. What is that? MR. DONAHUE : That will be once we have a ARPA master plan. So we put it into categories . When all those project s are laid out into those acceptable categories , that will be considered the ARPA master plan. We have a preliminary plan. But we're still working through . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Good. 5-I and J, is this person going to be an employee or a contract or? MR. DONAHUE : A 1099 employee , so it will be a contractor . So it won't include benefits . It doesn't include -- MS. SCHUMACHER : A contract or -- who will have access to the contractor then on the -- of the City? MR. DONAHUE : What do you mean? MS. SCHUMACHER : When you -- when you want a report done that you used to get and you don't get now, how many are there? You were at the meeting s with the PEL. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Are you still getting all of those -- MR. DONAHUE : We haven't been getting cash flow reports since PEL's left. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. So that will be one of the things that will be given to you guys automatically or -- MR. DONAHUE : That's my hope, yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Mr. Schuster , will you please update the Exit Plan with the actuals for the years in which they are actuals and tell us if there is any hope for avoiding the 25 percent tax increase in a couple years here? MS. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : I think it's time to start looking at that because I don't think the City could stand a 25 percent property tax increase. And I think it's about time we get a few dates too. Do we have Serrenti ? We haven't heard anything about Serrenti in a long time. MR. DONAHUE : So we were allowing for the Police Chief to get acquainted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 with -- the new Police Chief to get acquainted and then they should be coming in in April. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, because I thought he's been there for a couple years, has he not? No? Okay. There's another thing I had. I do have some time yet. What about the pocket park? MR. DONAHUE : The pocket park should be filled within the next month. And the hope is that it's finished by the end of the year. MS. SCHUMACHER : A year again? MR. DONAHUE : The end of the construction year, you know, so September , October . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And then I do have a request there's -- in the backup on the groups that are being hired to work on the strategic plan and market it, there is something I don't understand , an acronym CWOPA employee . MR. DONAHUE : I'll look into that and I'll see what I could find out for you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. If it's any help, it's -- one is a Chief Council Joe Bush and the other is an executive Neil Weaver. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 that would be nice to know. And the good ole thing of stormwater , when are we going to take some action? MR. DONAHUE : We are still in discussions with surrounding municipalities . There's a couple that are waiting to see what we do in terms of the zoning to see whether they want to be involved with stormwater . MS. SCHUMACHER : It's already in the plan. MR. DONAHUE : What's that? MS. SCHUMACHER : Stormwater is already in the plan. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. But for -- in order to create regional cooperation , they want to see how we act in terms of zoning. And we're moving through that process . MS. SCHUMACHER : Do you have a time table? MR. DONAHUE : I'm hoping to have an authority up and running by the end of the year. MS. SCHUMACHER : Here we go again -- MR. DONAHUE : I mean, it does take time, right? There's lawyers --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, but how much time have we had for Pete's sake? The Sewer Authority 's been sold for how long? MR. DONAHUE : I share your frustration . But progress is slow sometimes . You know, we're getting there. MS. SCHUMACHER : It's time for some gasoline to the match to get it moving. MR. DONAHUE : I hear you. Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First off, I'm going to kick off on something real easy. We had a resident come in here and talk about the garbage tax. What I found interesting recently is the newspaper reported that the City had tried to move in and get the class action decertified , not surprising . What I found surprising in there was the admission that if -- by the -- I believe the Solicitor of the City, if the -- if it was successful or decertifying , then they would only have to worry about individual s coming in and suing which was somewhat unlikely because of the burden that it would involve and the low 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 amounts of money that would have to be returned to them which tells me right from that is that the City understands it has overcharged by its own admission that it has money that is due back to the population . The City said if we are sued we are going to have to have -- the City Solicitor made a statement that if they're sued we're going to have to return some of that money. That in itself is concerning . That says that we're not equally balanced in that fund. And it's known. And that's all that I have to say about that issue. Now I need to point out on 5-I and 5-J on the agenda may be considered invalid or improper. It was voted on by Council and due to a member not being here, it was not tabled. It was not put aside. It was pushed forward for a final vote. A final vote was taken. And to affirm, it needs to have a majority . It was not. Council President stated on the record they would just bring it up again next session and then the session was adjourned . We now have procedural errors. The proper way to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 attack this is clearly written as was stated as there is a way to ask for reconsideration . The error involved in that is documentation presented does not say reconsideration . It says introduction . It if was a reconsideration , it needed to be advertised as a reconsideration . Section 402 of the Operating Rules are clear as are the Sunshine laws. At least 24 hours before any regular meeting of Council , an agenda containing all the items -- all -- are to be -- that are scheduled to come before a Council meeting shall be publically posted. No action on a matter not included in this posting agenda shall be allowed . This motion was not posted 24 hours beforehand. This motion is barred by the Sunshine Act and it's barred by Act 405 of the operating clause. It needed to be posted publicly yesterday . It has expired in that time period and by that, is ripe for challenge . There are procedures to be followed . It is true that you can under Section 10 reconsider at the next Council meeting . That does not relieve you of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Sunshine rules and the notice for advertisement , nor the bar for this body to hear anything that is not advertised . MR. DONAHUE : That's why it was put on the agenda. MR. COYNE: It was not put on the public agenda. Introduction was. Motion for reconsideration was not. If it comes before this body it needs to be publically disclosed 24 hours beforehand. Also, Section 13 specifically touches the section that any resolution that's come up beforehand no ordinance which is in the same substance or issued manner shall be considered again during the same fiscal year. And I understand you're going to put up unless it's noted unless by consent of majority of the entire Council . This line in itself circumvent s the finality of any vote in this office. It allows upon the absence of any member since there is no time limit to pull up any ordinance in the book, reevaluate whether it's law or not and to strike it down or change it. That is -- that goes into the face of the rules of this body 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 and then intent of this body. And I would strongly -- MR. DONAHUE : I disagree . I disagree . MR. COYNE: You may disagree . And I brought it up to the Solicitor because -- MR. DONAHUE : Your time is up, Mr. Coyne. MR. COYNE: You have interrupted . And I'm going to finish my line. MR. DONAHUE : Your time is up, Mr. Coyne. MR. COYNE: That is good. The Solicitor , I would like to hear his opinion . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. ATTY. GALLAGHER : In terms of advertising the reintroduction -- or the reconsideration , if the motion for reconsideration failed, then the vote wouldn't happen. So we put the -- we put the motions back on with the intention that if the reconsideration did pass, then it would be able to be introduced. MR. COYNE: (Inaudible talking from the gallery .) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 ATTY. GALLAGHER : I understand where you're coming from but I think that we've complied with the Sunshine . MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. I'll save it for on the question . MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I'm good. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : So just -- I just have one thing. There was a question last week whether we maintain a list of vacant service stations . Our City Clerk did investigate and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 we do not at the moment. But I think that is something that we need to look into moving forward . And that's all I have at this time. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
