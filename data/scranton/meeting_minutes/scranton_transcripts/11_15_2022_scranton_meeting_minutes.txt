And this money raised is for less toxic treatment for kids with cancer. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 So this event will be Sunday, November 27th from 12 to 2 p.m., at the Career Technology Center at Lackawanna County where we invite -- I'm sorry, it's at 3201 Rockwell Avenue.

VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. MCANDREW : Miss Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Do you have any updated information on the status of the three union contracts , police, fire, and Single Tax Office? MR. MCANDREW : Well, what I do know is the Police Chief just mentioned it's going to arbitration . I also heard on the street that the firefighters are as well. The other one I'm not aware of. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, one of these days they're going to come to fruition and the other shoe on the budget is going to drop. Also, you know, in listening to Chief 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Carroll , I wonder, you know, what impact on these drawn out negotiation s and arbitration are having on the morale of the employees . It's something we often don't consider . We think in terms of the money it's going to cost the citizens . But if I were an employee and I were in a union, that would weigh on my mind. What about the status of the 2021 audit? MR. MCANDREW : So Mr. Voldenberg sent an e-mail. And we have yet to receive any answer. But Mr. Voldenberg and I had a discussion today knowing that you would bring up this question . So, Mr. Voldenberg , what did we decide? MR. VOLDENBERG : That I will reach out direct to Kohanski and Company tomorrow morning . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. You know, I'm going to hit up Mr. Murray, our Controller . I want him to start keeping tabs on how we're paying the legal counsel for all these union negotiations . I wonder what that money's going to look like. Hopefully that's in the budget somewhere . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Speaking of the City, this morning I did look again at the City website . And I see that there's some effort on the City archives , the financial reports and some of the other web pages. What had happened ? Did anybody find out why, you know, when you clicked on the archives you couldn't get a lot of the data that was there a month ago? MR. MCANDREW : I don't know what happened to be honest with you but, of course, we can inquire . MS. HODOWANITZ : If anybody is trying to look at the previous union contracts you're going to have a hard time because they're not there anymore. You know, also, I'm hoping that when they restore these files -- hopefully they're going to restore them that we will have the new DPW contract up there and not the previous one. And I was looking at the Single Tax Office had their updated City funds distributed and I'm wondering if did we have any update on the payroll preparation tax how that's moving along? MR. MCANDREW : Just with their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 presentation that was of recent. I didn't receive any update to that. MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. McAndrew , we received an update late this afternoon . And I'll share that tomorrow . MS. HODOWANITZ : So you could put that in Third Order next week? MR. VOLDENBERG : And I could also share it tomorrow . MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, just from my memory now, Thursday is the next caucus for the budget at 6 p.m. Okay, Item 5-C, the $41,000 transfer from the contingency fund to the Civil Service Commission account , I wasn't -- I looked at the backup exactly why did they have a negative $41,000 in the special City's fund? It didn't really say. It just said they were in the hole. MR. MCANDREW : I'm not sure. MR. SCHUSTER : That is a question I asked tonight . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, maybe we could find out that for next week. And Item 5-M, the Reilly Association 's contract for engineering services , I looked at the updated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 or I assume it's updated fee schedule . Is there a cap on that contract or do we just pay as we go? MR. MCANDREW : I'm not sure. I'm think we had a discussion about a cap. MS. HODOWANITZ : Is there a cap on the Reilly contract , does anybody know? ATTY. GALLAGHER : -- City administration it was in the RFP/RFQ. They are permitted to bid out their fees such as the one -- the fee schedule that they attached to this legislation for jobs that did not fall under the scope of the contract . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. All right. ATTY. GALLAGHER : So to say if there is a cap or not, I do not know that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Is there anyone else that would like to speak? MR. COYNE: Good evening , Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . Looking at the budget, it mentioned that the property values in the City have dropped over the past year and at the same time it seems that we're increasing taxes. It's quite interesting that as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 residents lose more money value they get charged more money. I don't think that's how it's suppose d to work. I think that when the (inaudible ) is raised, then the fees raised are supposed to be -- compensate for that. I just found it interesting that it was mentioned that the City's property values have decreased at the same time they are asking for 3 percent increase . Looking at that 3 percent increase , we have it project ed because as we've heard, arbitration is looming because it seems that the negotiations aren't negotiations . They are just a waiting path until arbitration is actually called because that seems to be the outright plan at this point. Looking at the DPW raise, I think it would be prudent to take a look at 3 percent that DPW used and gave that as a baseline to the fire and police department contract s even though it's not officially out there, a 3 percent raise across the board for this budget would be reasonable to put in there as a buffer. Considering it's already been given 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 out to one department , I doubt that the other departments are going to take less. So having it with no increase because we don't know what the budget is kind of undercuts everything . We're looking at more jobs in this, managers , directors . In 5-D I believe we're looking at a housing manager and they talked about five spots just for rental properties . It's amazing how when a city is struggling financially and we are still struggling financially that management starts getting top heavy that the less money we have to spend and the tighter our budget is, the more we find to spend on employees . Corporations have the opposite of do more with less which causes a tremendous amount of problems . City government and government in general has do less with more which is commensurate of the issues of throwing more people onto duplicate , to non define, to pad jobs to produce no more in the end. None of this has been proposed for cost savings for the City in the past year has actually come to real fruition in numbers . For the authorization of the appointment for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 the Housing Authority , it shouldn 't be the Mayor's job. At this point City Council has the option. It should be taken on our good faith, her word, what she decides , City Council should take its duty, interview the people, all candidates and City Council should decide. She advocated that -- the Mayor -- when she let the 30 days go by. City Council should not depend on her vetting because it's not her position to vet anymore. It's City Council 's and it should be before this body. Disaster recovery plans, what's the City's financial disaster plans since we're talking about that? We all know the (inaudible ) coming. We see it there. But I see no cuts anywhere just increases . It was talked about that the privacy and security information is an excuse to keep the front door closed. Police had put up there that the public image is an issue. Well, part of the public image is when you need to secure the door against the public because people in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 building are not securing properly private and secure information . If they can't secure information in this building and do their jobs, they shouldn 't be on that job. We have a constitutional right to access to public buildings . To do any less violates the oath all of them took. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Would anybody else like to speak that's not on the list? MR. ELLMAN: Thank you, Council . I want you to look at these pictures I took of three different properties in my immediate neighborhood like two blocks away. There's three different houses here. As you could see, it clearly shows a misapplication from the office of the licensing bureau under Mr. Oleski. He's waiving the fee. As far as I could find out, he has no job performance to do so. I think these fees are suppose d to pay his salary and he has no business whatsoever waiving them. I believe there should be a total investigation from day one why he's been doing this and when he started . If he stopped , I don't know because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 these are recent pictures from this past summer. You know, they -- I think this has become a personal issue with Mr. Oleski and Mr. Sunday. I filed complaint s for years, not a single thing I've ever complained about has been address ed. But here, all of this nonsense 's been going on because of rubbish 50 or 60 feet from my house to the house next door. It doesn't make any sense to educated people that we've talked about it. I think Mr. Sunday's got a personal -- just a vindictive agenda here to keep this going. First, it was like I said last week it was rubbish . Then it was a metal lawn chair on my porch that's been there 20 years. Then he went to the back to the rubbish next door like it's my business . The people living there didn't get a ticket. The people that own the house didn't get a ticket. I got one. And I'm going to court and I'm going to drag everybody into court because it says on my papers from them I could subpoena people. All of this over nothing because of some foolish nonsense from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 these two. They don't have nothing better to do in the city than to bring an issue like this up is just senseless . Right where I keep complaining about trucks on City property which is residential , the man that changed the motor there's -- the motor weighs 4,000 pounds is sitting there, oil cans and rubbish everywhere . I mentioned it three or four times. He's never been down there to give them a ticket. The man lives on -- just almost across the street from where he parks his truck. And this is all so senseless . Anyway, I want to see something investigated here. These waivers , they're taking money from our pockets . I don't know if it's friendship or what's going on. It's like if one of the policemen took care of a ticket or something . He has no legal authority to waive anything . If an individual wants to work on the house themselves and do some lesser work, they don't have to buy a permit. Otherwise , this very department told me if you want to do business in the city, you have to do it with an approved contractor . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 had somebody from -- I don't know, they were Throop or something wanting to do my roofing . And the construction people had to come from town which I had nothing do with it. But the man who gave a lower bid lived way out of town and the City wouldn't let him come in here to work he said. Thank you. I know I'm letting it all steam. But this is -- this is something going on here that is time to put an end to it. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . Tonight I'd like to talk a little about followthrough . You people pass a lot of legislation . And then it goes away and we don't know -- I mean, what's happening . For instance , do you think when we walk by the corner of Wyoming and Linden we see a park -- a pocket park, no. We see an eyesore . What's going on? Okay, I guess like the same answer. The leachate when I ask about the leachate and the content of the leachate , concentration of certain items -- well, we asked for that. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 we never got it. We depend on you to do this kind of stuff. And you never follow through . The acoustics , when I brought that up last week it was just like, yeah, yeah. What is going on with the acoustics in this room? MR. MCANDREW : I don't know. I agree with you on the acoustics . We have been promised this for three years -- three and a half years that I'm here. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can you please follow up on the three items that -- MS. SCHUMACHER : I haven't finished them. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Well, I'm taking care of three of them for you. I'm trying. MS. SCHUMACHER : Stormwater , you know, it's been a long time since we've heard that. When is that going to be completed ? You know, last week -- MR. KING: East Mountain , there's going to be -- MS. SCHUMACHER : I know the meeting tomorrow night, yeah. I'm on with that. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Mr. King last week asked about the street signs. Why don't we get reports on the street signs so we all know? I mean, are they being fixed or not? I know I went by one today that had absolutely green smudge. That was all that was to it. And things that are coming up that we've signed -- Meadow Brook Two, that's another important project especially related to stormwater . But before that can be done we have to have some rights, some property rights. Have they been done? We should know that. I mean, is that whole project going to be overlooked because they didn't get the necessary rights? And then, you know, we have trucks. We have those trucks that clear the -- are suppose d to clear along the curbing . But where are they when you need them? We had a lot of leaves in the gutters and over the drains so the water couldn't go in the drains which causes people problems . Where were they? Last week I think we had a big storm. Today we were calling for a storm. Did you see one on East Mountain Road? I didn't. And I don't know where they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 hide them. So I would like you guys to start following up. When you authorize a project , that's when you should start keeping up with it and sharing that with the public. And I would like to know how long the police contract has been in arbitration ? We've been hearing negotiation . And is the fire contract the same? MR. MCANDREW : I think they are about to go to arbitration . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, well, the Chief said two things. MR. MCANDREW : Right. Well, maybe for clarity sake I'm not sure. But that's the direction . I know that the Fire Department the latest I heard is soon. The actual date is -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Is going into arbitration or -- MR. MCANDREW : Yes, going into. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I guess that will be it for tonight . But I do hope you start keeping us up-to-date on the project s you have authorized . Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 anyone else like to speak? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. MCANDREW : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: None at this time. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. MCANDREW : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a couple quick ones. I know Joan had mentioned during citizens participation about the work session that's this Thursday . We haven't announced it before -- or earlier during the announcement portion of our meeting . So I just wanted to make sure that was clear, this Thursday at 6:00 we'll have another budget work session with department heads. So that will be with the Mayor's office, with the Business Administrator , human resources , and the Law Department that evening . And I just wanted to bring up a citizen complaint , an issue that I'm not sure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 if they've received violations before, but it's been a previous problem that I brought forward at 417-419 Harrison Avenue where they habitually leave the trash cans out the entire week and quite filled. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could circle back with Code Enforcement on that issue I'd appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. I just have one. So I received an e-mail from Mr. Dennis Engles. He's the principal or one of the director s over at Lincoln Jackson Academy . So the e-mail was sent to me -- and, Mr. Voldenberg , I'm going to pass this onto you. But the Safety Committee of the Electric City Academy would like to request the street in front of our building 1739 Dixon Avenue, Scranton , PA 18509 be designate d as a school zone with proper signage. Please let me know if this is a possibility and thanks for your time. I'm sure it shouldn 't be a problem . But let's put it in that direction if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 would, please. I'll forward the e-mail -- the exact e-mail to you later. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Thank you. So that's all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. MCANDREW : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ENACTING THE “RENTAL ORDINANCE OF 2022” BY REPEALING AND REPLACING THE CITY’S RENTAL PROPERTY CODE. MR. MCANDREW : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SCHUSTER : I would like to make a motion to table Item 5-D. MR. MCANDREW : Is there a second? I'll second. MR. SCHUSTER : When looking at this, Item 5-D does include additional housing inspectors to designated rental inspectors . There's some positions here that haven't been approved through the budget process yet. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 So I'd like to make this motion to table it until we get further clarification on that if we could reach out to the administration and see why this is included in this before we pass the 2023 budget. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : I agree. There's positions in here that -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : I don't mean to interrupt , Mr. McAndrew , I'll have Frank reach to -- there's just some question I had (inaudible ), which is good. But under the tenant responsibilities it says any damage over 500 is a violation of the chapter . I'm just wondering why over 500 is a violation instead of -- it should be any damage should be a violation I would think. I don't know if that's an error or not. And then with the search warrant , I think it should be administrative warrant . So that's just -- it's not a big deal, just reach out to them and see if we can make that switch. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I don't understand why we can't ask the questions or concerns that we have and have to table it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 and not just still be able to introduce it and to discuss the legislation this evening . I was going to speak to this legislation as well as 5-E and 5-F tonight , which I could do later or now. But I think it will be important to add the new positions to this department and with the changes in this ordinance . So there they're substantially changing it from what it had been. And this is not been working the way that the ordinance was currently written . So they've done a lot of work to make those changes there. And I'm in favor of moving forward with it. I do understand the concern s about the budget and I'd be happy to find out what the answer is to that too. I just don't think it's necessary to table. MR. SCHUSTER : I think there's some position s that are missing from this ordinance as well as positions added. It seems the budget should be passed before this comes before us. MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? There's a motion to table. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. KING: Yes. MS.

MCANDREW : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I just had a brief summary that I wanted to include about a few of these pieces of legislation and the changes that you're seeing. So there is the permits reform. There's still a lot of unnecessary permits that we still -- on the books that weren't collecting or we had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 low collection rates on. So that's going to help to update the permits and the ones that we find necessary and appropriate . One of the changes in there too is for the dog licenses which are also collected by the county. So we're just going to leave it to the county to do that. And from what (inaudible ) told me it sounds like they'll be coordinating with people who have previously paid for licenses with the City so that they are aware of who would need continue paying for these licenses . And the contract or licensing reform as well as that's going to be helpful in making it a little less difficult for contract ors to become licensed with the City. It's something I've heard over the years even from my own, like, contract or that I've used on my property before how the contractors haven't wanted to go through the process within the City and would rather work outside of the City because of some of the holes that they have to jump through . And this is to make that process less difficult for them and to encourage an increase in the amount of contractors that are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 working here in the City of Scranton . And the rental regulation reform as I mentioned already , there will be a lot changes taking place with that. We know rents are increasing . The City is becoming a place that's not as affordable for people to rent. And that's a narrative that I've heard a lot more even over the past year. And for a long time I was a renter. And I remember it being very affordable . So I feel like that's been a quick change in our City. And along with the rentals that are available , there are safety issues. There are things that we are not able to inspect as a City the way that the legislation is currently written because we have -- there has to be an issue where we're invited in or an emergency that we're already present there for inspect ors to be able address . They are not inspecting these properties when someone comes in to pay for their rental registration or to register their rentals and we don't really have a good idea of what rentals are out there because we have a really low compliance rate with the people who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 actually pay for the rentals . And in addition to that, there are people with multiple rentals on their property that aren't registered that we're not aware of. And so a lot of these issues cause potential safety and health risks for our residents . And we want to take care of our residents . But in order to make these changes , we're going to need the staffing changes to that because with the current capacity , they're not going to be able to address even, you know, the small portion of those issues without having the housing inspectors to do the work. And it's going to take some time to initiate and to get everyone on board with. But I feel personally it's a really important move for us. And I've always taken issue with the out-of-town landlord s. And granted , we do have responsible homeowners , responsible landlords within the City. But then the ones that aren't responsibile , those are the ones that we're often having these continuous cyclical problems with blight and with property issues. So it all ties in together . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. MCANDREW : All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Excuse me. MR. MCANDREW : Opposed ? I'm sorry. Did you have -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I was going to make a motion also to table this. Although I do agree with probably most of what's in here, I think we're putting the cart before the horse. Page four of this document has a backup. In the backup documentation on page four there's position s in here that have not been approved yet through the budget process . There's also these rental position s and the new inspector changes that I do think we need a little bit more info on. So I would like to make a motion to table this. MR. MCANDREW : Well, did it -- MR. SCHUSTER : I didn't get to ask on the question . I was late to the ball game on that one. But on the question , I would like to make a motion to table.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. KING: Unfortunately I think we already voted on moving it forward . However , I think the opportunity would arrive when it moves to Sixth Order next week. MR. SCHUSTER : It can. Again, we have a budget. If we're going to be adding new position into a department , I think the budget should be passed before legislation is approved stating that those new position s are included . So that's my two cents. So I'll be a no on that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions . MR. MCANDREW : All right. Thank you. You can hit that next week. Okay. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-F.
