OVERTIME REPORT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS PROVIDED BY CITY CONTROLLER RECEIVED DECEMBER 31, 2023 FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY THROUGH DECEMBER OF 2023. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a comment on Third Order. Prior to December I requested that Council receive a copy of the labor counsel billing specifically related to the Scranton Fire Department 's CBA. Mr. Voldenberg , I know we didn't receive anything on that yet, but if we can reach out again to get that billing . MR. VOLDENBERG : We have not receive d. I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. Also, when it comes to budget transfers if we just get -- if we could just ask the administration if they could provide a brief description of what some transfers are, what the reasoning for them are. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. That's all on Third Order. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have two announcements . First, I wanted to wish everyone a Happy New Year. And second, I wanted to bring up a dinner that's going to be happening Sunday, January 14th beginning at 2 p.m., and that is for the Scranton MLK Commission . That's their annual dinner they host for Martin Luther King, Jr., Day. And that's going to be at the University of Scranton DeNaples Center. You could purchase tickets for that. A single ticket is $25. And there is further information about the event on the Scranton Area Community Foundation 's page. But I'm sure the University of Scranton has something up about it as well. That's all. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Anyone else? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I would like to wish everyone here a happy and healthy new year and welcome back. MR. SMURL: Are you good? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, that's all I have. MR. SMURL: All I have is, I would like to welcome our new attorney , Tom Gilbride . Welcome . And that's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First is Michael Mancini . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , City Council , and Happy New Year; Mike Mancini , resident of the City of Scranton . Yesterday I took a walk around the Nay Aug Park. It was my first chance to actually get out since my diagnosis with Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Thanks to the grace of God that I was looking at 12 months of biweekly treatment s and I was able to get through it in about four and a half. I planned on going to a gym but going there New Year's Day was probably out of the question , so I took a walk around Nay Aug 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Park. To my surprise walking around the park inside that pool, they could have put any type of Christmas decoration in there. I don't know if anybody noticed . It's a jack in the box, bing, surprise . Well, look inside the pool and you could actually know where the Mayor's originally from, Oregon. In Oregon they have a lot of mines. With those mines, there's a lot of tailings. Those tailing actually sit in both of our pools. It's a disgrace , shameful . And this pool is not going to be started until next year, not this year. It's going to be about six, maybe seven years before those kids are able to go swimming in that pool again. And yet the Mayor just nonchalantly says okay. All right. Well, you could tell that with arrogance , the outcome is not well. When she ran for Mayor, the majority of her funds were gathered by out of state funds. She doesn't think too highly of us. She doesn't think too highly of this Council either. You know, you're suppose d to have your agenda from the City of Scranton at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 noon. Many times you don't get it until about 4:00. You have the Recovery Act. You have to make informed decisions on a lot of this stuff, but yet you don't get in until 4:00. She doesn't think too highly of this body either. It's evident . When we had that flood, where was she? Nowhere to be found. When you truly don't know the people of the City of Scranton , you cannot make a good decision , okay. City of Scranton is holding documents that I tried to request on three separate occasions , sales of the Parking Authority and the Sewer Authority . And I have yet to receive those documents , October the 15th. At one point the administration gave me a letter stating that they don't even have these document s. Well, if they didn't have the document s, they would be in violation of the Home Rule Charter . I have proof of that. It's unfortunate . You know, it's unfounded that somebody -- unfathomable that somebody could actually walk into this city, be a resident for as long as I have, on a lot of cases property 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 owners just to be shoved to the side. You know, you would think that with a degree from a major college , major university , Harvard , you know, you would determine and have the ability and understand ing when to pick up a phone, okay. She doesn't even do that well. She sits here half a day and admires that diploma on the wall as opposed to working for the people of the City of Scranton . It's evident . We see that in our roads. We see that in our blight. We see that in our community every day, but yet she doesn't see it herself . Well, Paige Cognetti , your arrogance will become your downfall. While the rest of us look at national politics , City of Scranton has a very important decision and that's Mayor. Next May is when she's up for reelection . Take a strong look at what you do locally because it's easier to fix a pothole than it is to fix anything else. Paige Cognetti , while you're at it and you're on your way to Waverly , take a look at those roads because that's what ours are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 suppose d to look like. Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Next, Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I think the first thing I want to talk about is these microphones up here. You know, we come down here to hear what Council has to say in your caucuses and things. And, you know, I sit there and I cannot hear what's going on. So when your back is to the audience and there is one, two, three, four mics, can't each of you have a mic and speak into it? Mr. Smurl, you were perfect tonight and Mr. McAndrew . But I can't hear anything else. I don't know what the new Attorney Gilbride even said. So what's the sense of coming? Should we stay at home and listen on TV because I'm sure that the resident s of Scranton can hear what's going on more than we can here in the audience . So I don't know how much those mics cost, but it seems that each one of you should have one in front of you. One of the things I wanted to talk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 about and I get all off my agenda when I hear things with the first caller -- the first speaker that was up here. And I'm not sure what his name was. I, as you all know, spend a lot of time at Nay Aug Park. I'm on the board up there at Nay Aug Park. I'm very proud of Nay Aug Park. Nothing is perfect . Everything takes time to get it done. So it's easy to stand back and point fingers and say, how come it's not done, how come, time, time, time. But it takes time. And I'm very proud of the fact that the pool will get started next year. I'm very proud that the kids will have someplace to swim in -- next year when they start to dig for the pool. So, you know, I'm thrilled because the first discussions that went on with the pool it was in nowhere. It wasn't even on the agenda at all. And now we at least have a year that it's going to get started . So I thank the Mayor. I thank the committees . I thank anyone who has anything to do with getting the pool going and at least to have a date on when it's going to get started . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Also, I wanted to talk about my projects , okay. And you know anyone that has been sitting here, Mr. Gilbride , this is your first time hearing me talk about things. But my big thing that I like to talk about are my street signs. It's been five years, five years since I stood here at this podium and gave you a spreadsheet of the missing street signs that I ran into each day. I was new back to the city. And I was continuously getting lost. So I made a spreadsheet of those street signs that I ran into each day. I present ed it to Council . And I've been presenting something and talking about the street signs. The last information I was given on the street signs was that there was a -- oh, what is it called where they go -- a grant that there had to be a grant. Well, that was the first time I heard about a grant because before when I went down to DPW, they showed me their database which was 9,000 entries on that database for street signs and stop signs. And it was a matter of -- first there wasn't enough personnel . There was only 1.5 persons that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 working on the street signs. So that was understandable . Then it was something else, something else, something else. So it's five years that we've been trying to get decent street signs. And I notice it so much when I'm out of town and I come back into town. I come up the turnpike . And depending whether I get off at Wilkes-Barre if I had enough of the turnpike , I might get off in Wilkes-Barre. I might get off in Scranton . If I get off at Wilkes-Barre and I'm driving I say there's those street signs. The first thing that gets me again are the street signs after I've been out of town. So that is always my hot button is the street signs. I'm also concerned about the wall there by the Radison Hotel. Someone is going to be hurt. That steel pole that's sitting in that crumbling concrete is going to fall. It's going to hurt someone . And the city is going to be liable. I guess it's the city's wall. But I have spoken about that before as well. I also wanted to ask about the code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 enforce ment vehicles , nice blue and white little vehicles running around the city. I don't know how many of those we have. But I was wondering today when I saw them pull up to -- there was an accident on the street. That's what it was. And they pulled up there. And I thought to myself because I was at the stop sign, is there a report that's available to the public as to how many citations they have given out? And if they have given citations out, how far -- how many citations do they give out before they are really turned over for -- I don't want to use the word prosecution but, you know, before something is done that they have to really do something . So on closing real quick, I want to thank everyone who volunteer ed for the light show up at the park. We had a lot of rain. And the rain really threw a lot of our lights out. So for those that did come up and help us to volunteer at the park and get us through those days, I thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Les Spindler . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner , taxpayer . I wish everybody a happy, healthy new year. Welcome , Attorney Gilbride . I see he's got a paper nameplate . Is that a cost cutting thing? Well, about 10 days ago before Christmas my wife and I were riding around the city looking at lights. And on Orchard and Prospect we saw a wonderful display . Mr. Smurl, is that yours? MR. SMURL: Yes, it is. MR. SPINDLER : I thought I saw your -- it was awesome . I parked the car and got out and walked all around. It was a wonderful display . And my wife asked a gentleman that was there how long it took. And he said it only took three weeks to put up. That's a short amount of time for all of that stuff. If anybody didn't see it, next year I'd advise you to go up. It's really nice. You did a good job. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. SPINDLER : On the way in I picked up a refuse and recycling calendar . It 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 goes up to June. Are they not going to collect the last half of the year? MR. SMURL: They're going to be, but there's other things that may happen in the future, in the near future so probably send another one out. MR. SPINDLER : Last year we had a schedule for the whole year. MR. SMURL: Yes, I understand . MR. SPINDLER : Speaking of cost cutting , I got a great way to cut costs. Eliminate the parking authorities -- parking enforcement jobs. I talked about this for a long time. They selectively enforce the laws. Like I said, I was parked the wrong way about two years ago on my street and I got a ticket. And I complained and kids from the University of Scranton , New Jersey, New York license plates park right up to the corners, make it impossible to see if there is oncoming traffic which is a definite safety hazard. And I told one of the enforcement people who I knew. Nothing was done. I saw a car parked in the same spot for a week. And it wasn't moved. There was no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 ticket on it. I'm a taxpayer . I park facing the wrong way once and I get ticket. But the kids at the U don't get a tickets. When I was parked on my street, it wasn't a safety hazard. Blocking the view of oncoming traffic is a safety hazard. Next year in the budget, eliminate the parking enforcement jobs. We could save ourselves a lot of money because they don't do the job anyway. Next thing, December 14th in the newspaper this jumped out at me, a picture and a little article , Finding a West Side Parking Spot Just Became a Lot Easier. And the Mayor is there with some other people. That's a lie. I know the lot very well. It didn't get easier. It got more difficult . They took parking spots away in that lot. All they had to do was pave the lot and it would have been a lot nicer. They put islands in there with trees and other stuff. They took at least 25 percent of the parking spots away. So it definitely didn't make parking easier in West Side. I go to Vincenzo 's Restaurant now which is right across the street 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 from there. As a matter of fact, I went there Friday for pizza. I said, Vinny, what do you think of the new parking lot? He said, they took away a lot of parking spots between Vinny's, Keystone Restaurant across the street and the wine place right next to the parking lot. Sometimes you can't get in there on a Friday night. There was a lot more spots and the Mayor is blowing her horn, oh, a lot more parking . Like I said, it's a lie. They took parking spots away. And they are hurting the business es in there, not helping them. I guess that's all I have tonight . Thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Next, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Well, I guess the first thing I have here today is that I appreciate the comments of the first speaker here about the pool project as I've said many times before that project just wasn't put together right. And the water slide coming down, I really think that the people responsible for that should pay to have that slide put back up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 And there seems to be a debate on what occurred there and how the slide came down. I think the resident s should find their way into a courtroom and bring the Rec Authority there and the Mayor there and put them under oath and sue them and see if their immunity shields them from liability to replace that slide because there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. And the project was designed to leave that slide in place as they built it. I have the study at home. And I just think it's a sham what's occurred in this city with grant money over an extended period of time. But today I came here because I had to file an action in the Court of Common Pleas against the city. So I'm in Federal Court. And I'm in the Court of Common Pleas and I'm going to file another federal petition within a couple weeks when I do a little more research . But I find it very troubling because I have your quality of life ordinance here and all five of the Council members signed it. And I just want to say that is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 most corrupt document I've ever seen in my life and your solicitor is right here. I mean, you have three members of the board sit there and they can't ask anybody one question . And they have the solicitor running it as if it's some kind of real trial. And then when you get the transcript s, it's just a meeting . And then when you go through the whole thing and you win, the city doesn't give you your money back, okay. And the hearing I had Mr. Olecki sat there, didn't even have the inspector there. So I filed an appeal. I went to District Justice Corbett . And the city was the moving party. And she gave the city a continuance -- I think two of them. Why do you need a continuance ? And then the other question is, why aren't these tickets time-stamped and how did they even know they were ever presented to the property ? Real problem , this is your ordinance . Now, the other thing is, finally when it came to the court administrator for the District Court moved the hearing to Judge Pesota in Dickson City. Now, the city's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 attorney came there and said he didn't even know why he was there. He didn't read my complaint to the Court? And then when the Court heard the hearing and I brought transcripts in from the hearing where I beat them at the building appeals board, the building appeals board sided with me the first time. Okay, the second time I didn't waste my time because they didn't give me my money back so I went right to the district justice because they issued me a ticket. Well, the district justice held a hearing . The city showed up, no inspector , nobody and said I don't even know what I'm doing here. That's how corrupt the city is, okay? So then the district justice hears it. So the city present ed no case at all, none, zero, okay? And I presented facts and pictures and transcripts from the previous hearing and discussions with the district justice and he took it. Well, then he sides with the city with no evidence . So then I had to ask the Court to determine did you not have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 jurisdiction to issue a ruling in that? I asked him in writing . Well, he wouldn't answer that in writing . So now here we are here. But the question is, why would a resident be subjected to that kind of abuse, all right, and when -- in your building appeals board -- and then the following year like they do every year come back out again. So you're going to fine somebody . They're going to pay to have an appeal. You pay for the appeal. You win. You don't get your money back, okay. And then you find out in my appeal that they have no case, none. The inspector didn't show up. Nobody did. And this is what you five individuals signed on for. It's the utter most corrupt thing I've ever seen. So what I'm saying to you five Council members -- one isn't here -- that you are corrupt . And that law needs to change. And you need to fire the Director of Licensing and Inspections and get your shit together because I'm going to sue you in Federal Court next. And I'm not going to lose this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 See, people think that just because you're a truck driver or just because you're something , when the city hires two outside legal firms to deal with just a truck driver, that tells you something . And when the city's own attorney comes and he says he doesn't know why he's there, he couldn't come with evidence because there is none, it's all politics . And I love politics because I -- corrupt you guys are. All right. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MORGAN: The city has gone the wrong way for a long time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . Once again the Times prints this racist anti-Jewish, anti-Israeli , anti-American letters from several different -- to me, demented people that I can't see why a credible paper and an editor would keep such objectable dribble in the paper. They are not opinions . It's just hate-filled you know -- as far as I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 concerned , I saw on television several times right after the Jewish invasion slowed up, they weren't dancing in street no more in Gaza. They weren't singing the revolutionary song anymore, all the hate that Hamas brought upon them. To me, they deserve everything that is happening to them. You know, sometimes people wonder where all of this hate they have -- that Hamas has comes from. And the first week of May -- I'm not sure of the exact date, May 6th or 5th, the paper -- the Scranton Times had an article , the Muslim American Societies Philadelphia Chapter 's Facebook in arabic had a two-minute video that showed young children singing and dancing . It was put into English two or three days later. You know what they were singing and dancing about? The words, they were willing to sacrifice themselves . You're talking about little children . And they were singing about chopping off heads and so forth. This was in our paper if you want to read it. May 6th I think it was. They were on their way to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 These people were taught hate to start with. I don't know how it can be overcome in wars or anything else. And to change the subject , I saw in today's paper the apps for the Zoning Board. There was 11 apps. Six were asking for 22 new apartments . Six of the 11 are all residential zoning. The zoning board's responsible for so much demise. They allowed all of this single houses along North Main to be apartments . Now we're full of undesirable s. There's so many cars they park on the sidewalk and nothing can be done. Les was talking about a car been there for weeks. I got a junk car next to my property on Throop Street. It's been there five years. Nobody will do nothing about it. I don't -- and it's not a bad looking car. I don't know what's wrong with it. The man's allowed to live in a condemned house. This is our zoning board, our licensing bureau. You know, as the first gentleman said, I certainly agree with him if Mrs. Cognetti really wanted to do something for the City of Scranton, she should resign and let a capable 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 person take the place. But I think there would be a fight to stay here. And I don't know who in the world would want to try to clean up this mess that she's made of Scranton . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. If you would like to leave the address of where the abandoned car is, we could send it to the traffic division . MR. SCHUSTER : President Smurl, I'd say two years ago I stopped at Mr. Ellman's house and I did get the addresses of these cars. Mr. Voldenberg did send it over. So I'm going to send this again to see if we could get updates on these cars. MR. SMURL: We'll send it out again, Mr. Ellman. We'll send it to the traffic division . Okay? Thank you. MR. ELLMAN: This is what destroys our neighborhoods . MR. SMURL: We're going to try to take care of that for you. MR. ELLMAN: It just doesn't stop. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. Marie Schumacher . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening . I'm not sure that is such a good idea. I rode up that street to see that car. I think it might be a couple years ago. And there is some very pretty little flowers around that dirt that's been put around the -- washed around the wheels. So at least it's something pretty in the neighborhood . The main thing, of course, is this. Why are we going to pay double postage ? Do you have something we don't know? Are we going to have a change in our calendar maybe more than 6 or 12 months? Why are we spending the postage twice? Which of you have that group, the DPW? MR. SMURL: Mr. Schuster has that department now. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll check into that. MR. SMURL: Okay. Did you know? MR. SCHUSTER : I did notice it as well. Yes, I was going to ask that of the department -- well, of the administration . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : (Inaudible ) sent out but it was going to be for six months. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Another 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 thing is, what happened to the Beautiful Blocks Program ? The Controller 's report today has $30,000 sitting there in the budget and not a penny has been spent. Why do we have a program and not execute it? Anybody know why nothing was spent? MR. SMURL: I'm not sure. If it's grants they have to be applied for -- were they the $5,000 grants, is that what they were -- was that the one? MS. SCHUMACHER : No. MR. SMURL: No. MR. SCHUSTER : Was this the 2023 line item? MS. SCHUMACHER : Um hum. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. MS. SCHUMACHER : It is. And then this one, I'm just very curious because when you go through the Controller 's report there is under the Bureau of Buildings now, there is a 5,040.32 for Manci's I think. I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly -- collision repair. I don't know what building would -- does anybody know what the collision was with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 the building ? Okay, onto good news, I do believe that the drainage on Snook Street has been corrected . It's hard to tell. There's the water company is up there and perhaps DPW. I don't know who else, but certainly a lot of trucks and a lot of mud. But I do think that one's been corrected , which will be very nice because we won't have all of that inches of ice on Seymour Avenue and going onto 307. I guess that will do it for today. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That is all that is on the sign-in sheet. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . In the paper -- unfortunately I misplace d the article . I actually had it cut out like I do from time to time. The building up in Olyphant , it's 11 years old. It costs 20 million dollars built by the Slibco Chamber of Commerce . And 10 years -- for 10 years it was tax exempt, Keystone Opportunity Zone and now it's being torn down. Now, you might think what does that have to do with Scranton ? Well, guess what? The county waived taxes on it and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 we pay county taxes. So it does have something to do. And you wonder why we have people sleeping up along the railroad tracks. How many basic homes could 20 million dollars have built? The rents are way up. Next to my house, 12 to 1,500 a month. They start out at 1,500 and they say they'll cut you a deal. And it is not a pretty house. And I really wouldn't go on the front porch with any kind of crowd. I could see the condition of the joists and stuff. You know, I keep getting letters in the mail they'd like to buy my house. So I called my mortgage carrier and asked them if they could pull off some shady deal like buy the house out from under me. They said no, no way, not while you have a mortgage with us. So I was assured of that. But it's just shameful how much money gets wasted on these development deals. The mall went bankrupt . We lost 5 million dollars or something like that. And they pay taxes for one year. It just gets really silly. So I would hope sometime in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 future that something would change in that respect . They know what to do with our money. But, you know, it's just -- now it turned out that people are working out of home. But my father when we first moved to Scranton , the company was gutted. It was supposed to be a promotion . And a small six room house with six people and we had the privilege of one of the rooms being occupied as an office. Gee, thanks, guys. Eventually my father built it up that he had a half dozen people working for them and everything . But when we moved it, it was maybe we should move back home. A few weeks ago somebody was up here talking about woke. Well, I'm woke. And I'm damn proud of it. But here's the reason. We have a Senator from Florida . He wants to put an end to Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid . Oh, and by the way, he got caught with his medical organization and pled the 5th, 76 times. And his medical organization was fined one and one half billion dollars for fraud. And I'd like to point out that Social 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Security , Medicare, Medicaid , veterans ' benefit s, highways , bridges , a policeman sees somebody getting beaten silly on the corner and he's riding by he stops. And he doesn't ask, sir, Mr. -- Miss Punching Bag, did you pay your city taxes this year? So, you know, police and fire are somewhat socialist . So I mean, it's like -- it's a social organization and we take care of each other. And that's -- it would be quite impossible to run society otherwise along with education , by the way. Three people up there made their living from education . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Have a good night. MR. COYNE: Good evening , Tom Coyne, Minooka . Welcome back. And the first thing I would like to -- first question is, I understand that the file for Council 64 of 2023 creating overtime reporting requirements for all City of Scranton department s and employees , of course, since it was in Eighth Order did not -- held and tabled in Eighth Order does not carry over to this year. Do we plan on reintroducing that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 legislation as it was not just for public works, which it wound up suddenly being tagged to but for all department employees whether it be a city employee , whether it be Licensing and Inspection , not just specifically fire and police which already have the mechanism and DPW which seems to have it in place; but there are a number of other city employees that should be covered underneath this. Are we going to put that back on the agenda or are we going to not really want to track overtime because I know from the last report that we got, our overtime budget was only in excess of three-quarter s of a million dollars last year. I think three-quarters of a million dollars is pocket change to throw out unaccounted . Second, there were multiple request s last year for feedback on charging the normal -- the yearly rental fee to non-profits . As of last standing , the city did not understand the question of are we charging a rental fee to non-profits including the University of Scranton ? I'm not sure what verbiage hung them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 up. Was it non-profits ? Was it fee or was it rental? Has there been a followup answer yet from the City of Scranton on whether they are going to apply the rental fee to rental properties by non-profits ? Third, I'll move onto Council 's last year informational requests that were as we talked about were not respons ive and we have them in the right to knows. Mr. Argenta put in a simple request for information on all city-owned cars, where they are stored and if any are used for employee s to be taken home. His response , the City of Scranton did not have the information on its vehicle s. One of the members proved it wrong by pulling the insurance contract for the city that had that information directly in it of the vehicles and provided it. At that point a list was provided to City Council that supposedly did not exist according to the Right to Know Office and it was marked confidential . It's amazing how property that is owned by the public that is a public asset is suddenly confidential to the people who pay for and the city is liable to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 respond to. And in that, I have actually put in a right to know on legal claims. And unfortunately , my right to know was denied because of a new ploy. It seems that it was denied specifically because I put it in to be limited and not overbroad. But because of a new tactic, they have the data. But it's not in the format I requested . And they don't have to supply it if it's not in the format -- if I request a different format they don't have to -- that they don't have, they don't have to supply the information . So the public has to know what format the City of Scranton has all of its documents in to get information under right to knows or it's denied, which is a bad faith operation . And in that, I called the City of Scranton now, the City of Scranton 's Right to Know Office is the right to no office, N-O. I can see nothing . I can find nothing . Moving on from that, I wanted to touch back with calling the 311 number. I just want to remind everyone that Scranton has a new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 311 number. 311 has now become no one won. No single person wins when calling that. There have been multiple comment s here made that when Scranton is called 311, they got no response back. But it seems that is the proper response from this administration to the public. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Would anyone else like to address Council ? No. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. The first one -- and some of these I discussed in caucus earlier . The first one is, we got an e-mail from the city administration from the Business Department about the ethics -- the Ethics Code and the campaign contribution adjustment . There is three section s of the campaign contribution adjustment that are in the Ethics Code. And what the code states is that this can be changed every four years. And what the administration has done is it has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 upped Section A by $700. It has upped Section B by $1,300 and Section C by $1,300. When the Ethics Board was put in place, it was put in place by Council . The code was put in place to, you know, stop donors from influencing politicians . I just would like to know from the administration why we're upping this, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could sent it over to get some clarification on why we're upping the campaign contribution adjustment for the Ethics Code. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I want to thank some of the members of the audience tonight to keep some of these things on my mind with the recycling schedule . There may be a good reason why it's six months. I do not know that reason. But can we also reach out to the department that handles that? I think it's recycling coordinator because there was some questions I had last year also about this. I think the recycling coordinator is who sends it out. Can we ask them why it's only a six month 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 period rather than the full year? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. The overtime legislation , we knew this legislation would die in December . I was one of the people that pushed for this legislation so we could track overtime in all departments . I think that was a start of a conversation . I would have liked to have seen it done as it was. But at least it was a starting point. I thought Council and the administration would have a conversation about this to work something out that would be beneficial to the citizens . I would like to keep the conversation alive. As we were approaching December , I did ask that we ask for in writing how each of the items that were included in that legislation had been taken care of. So if we're documenting overtime in all departments , please provide us in writing how we're doing it in each department . So, Mr. Voldenberg , I ask if you could reach out to the Business Administrator and see if they could put in writing how they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 are documenting overtime for each department in the city. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that they do that. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. And another one someone from the public reminded me about is the rental fee. It was asked are we charging the University of Scranton rental fee as per the rental ordinance . The answer that was provided back was about dormitories . But it wasn't dormitories I was referring to when asking the question . So if we could ask are we charging the actual rental properties there the rental registration fee? MR. VOLDENBERG : They do charge for the off-campus housing is what I received . But I'll go back. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. I did get a few phone calls. The barrier s on the bottom of East Mountain Road had been moved to do some maintenance on the road there. I don't think all the barriers were moved back. I reached out to Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Voldenberg about that. He's on that. And I got some calls about some sinkholes in West Mountain . I'll send them over, Mr. Voldenberg . And then the last piece was I discussed in caucus was the tax forgiveness that we were talking about for victims of the flooding . So we discussed in caucus that Solicitor Gilbride was going to take a look at the legislation that had previously been prepared and keep that conversation alive so we could move towards some help for the people in the effected areas in the city. That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few comments . First, just today I received an update on one of the properties that I was asking about, 621 Alder Street. And I think they are still waiting on a court date for that unfortunate ly. So hopefully they will get that sooner than later. But that seems to be what happens with some of the properties when it gets held 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 up with the magistrate . The magistrate tries to get in touch with the property owner and then cannot and not that it falls off the radar but things just keep getting pushed further along. So I'm hoping that there will be some resolve there soon. I still don't recall receiving any updates about Front Street in South Side where there was a lot of left debris, mattress , garbage , things like that. I'm not sure that that's been cleaned up to my knowledge . I think that was something else too that was headed to the magistrate . So I'm going to ask Mr. Voldenberg to check in on that again for me. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And for the six month garbage schedule , like I said earlier , I don't think any of us were aware that it was just going to be for six months, but perhaps there's some changes that will be made to garbage that they needed to do that. I still would have liked the heads-up that it was only going to be for six months. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 I'm sure the postage was less because it's smaller than the calenders from last year. But in addition to our question about the schedule , I'd like to ask what was the cost for this year so we have that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find that out, Doctor. DR. ROTHCHILD : Great. Thank you. And the Beautiful Blocks Program that was -- that did take place over 2023, I'm not sure why perhaps the money for the city wasn't allocated towards that. But NeighborWorks did run that program again. So I'd also be interested in finding out the answer to that. And -- MR. VOLDENBERG : Dr. Rothchild , NeighborWorks will be in in a few weeks, but I'll ask them beforehand. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Great. And I know we had questions in past about the code enforcement vehicles . And I don't recall the number of them off the top of my head. MR. SMURL: Ten. DR. ROTHCHILD : Is it ten? Okay, that's what I was -- that was in my mind but I wasn't positive , so I don't want to answer that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 really. But, yeah, ten of those vehicles and then there is a process for citations prior to them going -- being taken to a magistrate . So the first one gets a door tag and a violation letter, then they'll get the quality of life ticket. I believe if they don't pay and then get a second ticket. And then from there they'll bring it -- try to bring it to the magistrate . And as I mentioned earlier , that could then get held up for different reasons there. And lastly, I wanted to bring up something that we've been talking about for a while here, the issue with handicap parking . And we revisited that over caucus. Councilman McAndrew had concerns about that as well and so we made sure that our solicitor is aware and going to take a look into the parking ordinance that we do have to see if there are any changes that we could make -- concerns about the enforcement so making sure that we have better enforcement and better compliance from people who are parking illegally in handicap ped spots. But then there is also the question 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 of for people who purchase the handicap permits in front of their houses and then have other people who may have a handicap placard parking there but don't live there making it more difficult for them to utilized that spot that they've now paid the annual fee for. So I'm also very interested in finding out the answer to what we might be able to do as a Council for to change the ordinance to make it better for people who need to use that type of parking . And that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. Thanks. So do I appreciate all public comment ? I certainly do. We get a lot of great ideas from the participants of public comment . Am a proponent of freedom of speech? Absolutely . I listen to Mr. Morgan almost weekly. Sometimes he brings us valid concerns . Sometimes I sympathize with his plight. But now it's my turn in Fifth Order to exercise my freedom of speech. I'll tell you something . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 come from West Side. I'm think I'm pretty thick skinned like a rhino. But I might be referred to as a lot of things, corrupt isn't one of them. It's not one I appreciate . I take that as someone questioning my integrity and questioning the integrity of the colleagues -- my colleagues to the left and right of me. So I take offense to that. I'm letting it known. And I don't appreciate it. All right. Next, so last year during the budgetary work session process in November an issue came up that I had a huge concern about and that was the city footing the bill per se for the Redevelopment Authority Director . Out of nowhere without discussion we were informed that this gentleman is going to be paid by the city. He's a nonemployee . And he's going to receive benefits from the city, both to be reimbursed . Couldn't wrap my head around it, still can't. So I posed a question to the HR Director . I said, okay, you're telling me it's okay, never been done before but, you know, I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 still not in agreement of. But I asked one question . We're self-insured . And, you know, at the expense of the taxpayers you're going to pay for this gentleman 's benefits -- probably family benefits , probably 30 grand. And the question I asked in addition to that was, hey, does the healthcare administrator , which is the broker for us that looks out for our best interest saving costs by the name of Willis Towers is the organization . And then the benefits provider Highmark , are they aware of this and are they okay with it? And they said yeah. I said, you know what, can I have that in writing ? And I was told sure. So fast forward almost three months I have yet to receive an answer. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can you please circle around, see what happened and, you know, tell them I'm waiting a response . And I'm sure my colleague s would like to know that answer too because I've been in a situation before on the school board where non-employees got benefits , didn't end well. Didn't end well. I don't want to get jacked up again with that or potentially have us, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 approve something that we probably shouldn 't have. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. I'll reach out for that document . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Next, so I received a concern today. Mr. Voldenberg , I already gave you the picture s. I already gave you a little bullet of the text that I got. But it's a property that's at the top of Luzerne on a little piece it's called Dalton. I never even heard of it but I know the area because it's where it crosses and becomes Division . So around there it looks like there is some illegal dumping . So can you please have code enforcement take a look at that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : And also we talked about this in caucus and we're not always informed as we would like to be. And we know that there is turnover in the city quite a bit. But we talked about in caucus that there's a posting for an assistant city planner . We have one budgeted for that I'm aware of. Is this a new one or is this someone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 that's leaving ? Is this the one that's leaving ? If you could help us out with that, you know, try to get an explanation with that because we're budgeted for one. And that's fine. If someone moved onto better things, that's great. And also in regard to street signs, Mrs. Jeffries , there's been dialogue and I share your concerns and sympathize with your plight. And I'm proud of you that you keep fighting for this. But I remember some discussion . It wasn't a bad idea. Like I say, a lot of good ideas come from you folks that, okay, cost is an issue. They're looking for funding . They're looking for grants. I'm not sure -- I don't want to misname the person. But -- and I heard of this also after hearing it the first time that, you know, there's vinyl sleeves that are pretty durable that we could use to reduce cost and get these signs done quicker . I know we talked about it. I don't know if we sent correspondence offering this idea to administration as a way of speeding up this process and do it, you know, more -- in a cost 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 efficient way. So could you -- maybe we didn't get a response . It was before the holidays . So if you could send that over as maybe an option or idea to explore so we get this project done once and for all? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I just have a few items. The six month recycling card, I'm also interested in that why it was only six months. I don't know if it had something to do with I believe we are going to implement Rubicon this year. So I don't know if it had something to do with that and if we were changing routes or something , but I'd also be interested in a response about that six month card being mailed out. Second, Grow America forming NDC in conjunction but ABM Parking confirmed that they are current ly reviewing all the question s that we had sent to them last year regarding that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 barnacle thing and parking violation devices that they want to implement if it's approve d by Council and to enforce . I believe they are coming to Council in January , Mr. Voldenberg . Are they coming to a caucus? MR. VOLDENBERG : They will be in in January . We don't have a date yet. MR. SMURL: Hopefully they'll have all of those questions ready for us -- MR. VOLDENBERG : They said they will. MR. SMURL: -- beforehand . Thank you. Stephen Avenue, there was complaint on Stephen Avenue, 215 Stephen Avenue someone had purchased the property , started renovating it without permits . The city went it. They fined the owners. And they did pay the fines. They are hiring licensed contractors now to complete the work. And the Brook Street with the bright light up on Brook Street, they were asked to put a shield or something else on it. And I had received more complaints with picture s showing the lights coming into other neighbor 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 houses. So if we could find out from Licensing and Inspection or is this zoning? I don't know who would be responsible to take care of this if it's a zoning thing or if it's -- a zoning ordinance about lighting or -- MR. VOLDENBERG : It's in zoning -- zoning is handling it right now. MR. SMURL: All right. Are they going to -- their next step certified letter and so forth to settle this? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , sir. MR. SMURL: Very good. Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . And that's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. No business at this time. EIGHTH ORDER. 8-A. No business at this time. MR. SMURL: If there's no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 MR. MCANDREW : Motion to adjourn . MR. SMURL: This meeting is adjourned . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
