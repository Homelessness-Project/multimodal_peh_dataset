We also did have an executive session prior to today's meeting regarding some potential litigation and a personnel matter. Before we move on with our regular business and Fourth Order, obviously there are a lot of questions regarding the vacancy in the Mayor's Office and how that vacancy will be filled. I want to turn it over to our solicitor to discuss how things are spelled out in the Home Rule Charter and the Administrative Code. And then there will be more discussion following . ATTY. MINORA: Thank you. As you could imagine , I've done a great deal of research and consulted with City Solicitor , Assistant City Solicitor and today also met with them and the solicitor for the Election Board in an effort to get as many views as possible of the way forward from this problem that's been created by the Mayor's vacancy . There are as I could see it right now three options to -- going forward on an appointment process . There's -- Council could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 do nothing theoretically and that would kick it to the Court of Common Pleas to appoint somebody . And if the Court of Common Pleas appoints someone , that person would serve for the unexpired term of the Mayor who's leaving . If Council appointments someone , there is a dispute on that what the term would be. Council certainly has the right to appoint someone . The question then becomes what would be the term of the appointment by Council to the Mayor's Office. There are two schools of thought on that. One is governed by the Administrative Code. And one is governed by another portion of the charter , which I'll try and unmuddy as much as possible . The charter in Section 602 deals with the election of Mayor and his term. It says that if a Mayor is an appoint ed position that he shall be appoint ed according to Section 309 of the code. And I'm sorry for getting into the weeds on this, but just so -- as much understanding can be made I will try. Section 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 309 of the charter actually deals with the replacement for vacancy on City Council . But it establishes a procedure by which someone is appointed . By virtue of that last sentence in Section 302, Section 309 gives a procedure for the appointment and it limits the term to the -- until the next municipal election . So that would be one interpretation . That's the interpretation of the solicitor for the Election Board. There is a separate opinion on what the term could be based on the Administrative Code. The Administrative Code is very clear. And it says that if a vacancy occurs in the office of Mayor, City Council shall fill such vacancy within 30 days thereafter by choosing a Mayor to serve for the portion of the unexpired term. So that makes that -- that is very clear in the Administration Code side. The Administrative Code clearly is in conflict with Section 309 of the charter . I'll be writing an opinion giving those options to Council and getting it to them hopefully by next Tuesday . And if I'm able to find more information for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 them between now and then I will include that. MR. ROGAN: Council did discuss possibly having a public meeting next week outside of our regular ly scheduled meeting to discuss how this process would play out. So that will be publically advertise d. We did talk about a couple dates. I don't think we have a firm decision on that yet. But there will be a public meeting regarding how the process is going to be structured once we receive the memo from Attorney Minora. So there will be much more to come on how this process is going to play out. I hope that gives some background on what the Administra tive Code states and what the Home Rule Charter states in terms of filling the vacancy . I'm sure residents will have opinions on how they believe the appointment should be filled. We're certainly open to hearing your opinions at the meeting here tonight . And I know we'll all have much more to say on this as things progress . MR. GAUGHAN : I just have one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 question . Solicitor Minora, I don't know if you would know this offhand . But if it is a special election , do you know how the candidates would be chosen? Obviously it won't be a primary . It would be a general election . So are they chosen by the two parties or how does that -- do you know how that works? ATTY. MINORA: It would be governed by the Election Code, which I'm not familiar with. At least I'm not familiar enough to give you an opinion right here today. No, I don't know. MR. EVANS: My understanding the parties would pick the candidates . But we'll -- ATTY. MINORA: I think that is correct . MR. ROGAN: In Council vacancies in the past, the parties have selected candidate s and there was a special election . MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . ((The following speakers offered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 public comment as follows : Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern . Bob Bolus spoke on matters of general concern . Fay Franus spoke on matters of general concern . Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Edwin Mix spoke on matters of general concern . Glynis Johns spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on city business and matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yeah, I'll make a couple comments here. Well, first, I want to apologize for our late start to our meeting today. As you could imagine , there was a lot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 to discuss and cover. You know, we're feeling a lot of things right now. I know I'm in the pool with most people. You know, I'm upset. I'm angry. I'm disappointed . But, you know, unfortunate ly this body is charged right now with finding the successor of the next Mayor. And we have to make sure -- we're in a crucial part right now for the future of Scranton . We've accomplish ed a lot of great things the last couple of years. And we can't afford to have any setbacks right now. At the same time, we need to make sure we continue city services and we start to heal and regain the trust of the citizens of the city. Right now if you're like me, you don't feel really great about yourself right now. And we need to start the process of taking care of that. And that's going to start with I believe our selection process and finding a leader of this city. And we're going to do our due diligence to make sure we do the very, very best to make sure we have the very best leader of the city going forward . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 When I first realized -- and this came to light that it would be this body, the five of us to choose the next Mayor for the remainder of the term, you know, I understood that that's kind of what the, you know, the anticipation of the event and how it was going to work out. But it wasn't quite the best. I thought maybe we could do things a little better. And I'm 100 percent in the camp of a special election coming up for the next Mayor. I do not believe that a two and a half year appointment would do our city due justice . I think we need to appoint someone for six months and hold a special election . This city needs an official that's been elected by this city. That's the best way going forward . That's my opinion . That is one of the ways this may shake out. That's how I want it to shake out. I want an election . And I want -- I think we need to -- and we will. We'll be holding some special meeting s. One of them will be coming up next week, next Tuesday where we'll talk about more of the process and how we're going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 to find our candidate . Right now this candidate -- it hasn't been determined yet if it's going to be a six month appointment or two and a half year appointment . I already told you the way I feel. And, you know, we're going to go through that. And we're going to make sure that we appoint the very best person as a consensus . We're at a -- like I said, we're at a really crucial part right now. And we have to make sure that we just stay forward . We keep the city moving. We don't miss a beat. And at the same time repair the damage that has been done. You know, I live here. I lived here my whole life. I'm not going anywhere . I don't like this stigmatism attached to us, what people say. I know it only takes one or two actions or bad deeds and it kind of contaminate s the whole pool. But I'll tell you what. There's a lot of great people in this city. And there's a lot of great people in this building right now that work really hard every day and are committed to doing what they have to do. And I don't want to change that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 I just want to put more on top of that and keep rolling forward . You know, there's going to be a lot more said about it. And I speak for myself right now. I'm not speaking for anybody else. I'm sure everybody else has their own feelings . It took a couple days for me to, you know, calm down, get ahold of everything and with a straight level head figure out what's the best course of action and what I think we need to do. We'll have some more debates coming forward on what we're going to do. Some of them will be calm. Some of them will be heated. But they'll all be above the board. They'll all be done in daylight. And that I could promise you. I believe , Joan, you brought up the bond rating. You know, we know what happened last time with our bond rating when we had such an influx in our city and such a lack of trust in our city. And anybody in the financial world knows, you know, anything , your bond rating is a fickle being. It's a fickle beast. And anything could affect it. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 this is something that very well could affect it. And that's something else that our decision and our process of making that decision is going to affect. You know, how smooth is this transaction done? And do we continue to have the faith of the financial world to continue a good bond rating which is one of the successes , one of the reasons why we had so many successes recently is because we haven't looked favored in the banking community . So we need to hold onto that as well. And Miss Schumacher brought up all the other things in the city that, guess what, they're not going away. We still have a City Hall issue. We still have rental registration issue. We still have stormwater coming down. There is -- nothing goes away because we're having a problem . That just means we all take a bigger piece of the pie to make sure everything is getting done. I spoke to Mr. Rogan the day of. And I let him know if there is anything he needed from me he could call me. I'm a phone call away. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 You know, this was thrown in his lap taking over. And I'm sure -- and I know he's going to do the best job he possibly could. But he's going to need the support of everybody around him to make sure it happens . It's not something he planned on -- on taking on on Monday afternoon . But that doesn't change the fact that it's not on his plate now. So we all have things we're dealing with right now that we didn't think we'd have to deal with and we just have to for -- you know, that's why we were elected . That's why we here to make sure we're taking care of this. So again, if that means meeting with department heads to see where they are on different issues that maybe we weren't really -- that was more of an administrative task. As a legislation body, you know, we're more of a conduit from the citizens to the administrative body. We take issues and we bring them to, you know, we get them to where they need to go. The administration makes the call and kind of helps with the process of solving the problem s. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 And, you know, of course, we have our meeting s which we take care of legislation issues that come down. But, you know, we're still elected . And we still work for the city. We're representative of the City of Scranton . So that might mean we might have to take more of a hands-on approach when it comes to department heads to get caught up. Like Edwin today with the corner of Florida and Linwood , you know, we're all going to have to be in the loop to see where Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Pocius left that project off on. We're going to have to come up to speed on that. Maybe that is something Mr. Gaughan can't get to, then maybe Mr. Donahue or myself could help Edwin along the way. So there will be a lot of things that we're going have to really get used to as we get this whole process under way. Right now it's kind of -- we're in a holding pattern and then it went like that. So we have a good game plan started . Tuesday we'll know better on what we're going to do. And by our next meeting next Wednesday we'll be well under way with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 process , with the game plan, the parameters and then we'll have more going forward because the sooner we can get a leader in place, the better we will be. But we're not going to make haste and just -- and put someone in or put them in the wrong way without giving it adequate thought because , you know, this is going to be for lack of a better word, six month or two and a half year decision that we're going to have to make and it will affect a lot of people. You know, there is 72, 76,000 of us out there that are going to depend on our decision that we're going to make in the next couple of days. While timing is of the essence , it makes absolutely no sense to hurry up to finish this process because it won't make any sense to anybody . So we'll use up probably most of that time that we have, at least getting up to that date that we have the 30 days to get this problem and our issue solved. But, you know, there will be -- it will be like a duck on water. We'll look calm on the surface . But there will be things going constantly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 underneath the water. That's all I have today. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just to start off by -- because it was brought up in public comment about Northeast Revenue Service , I believe their contract should be voided immediately and put out for RFQ as soon as possible . Tomorrow is the 4th of July, which is actually my favorite holiday . It's because it's a day where all Americans can come together to celebrate not only the birth of this nation but also the ideals that are set forth in the founding document . We haven't always lived up to those ideals. But we always come the closest when we are united when we collectively come to the conclusion that there is far more that unites us than divides us. The events and revelations over the last 48 hours quite frankly they are unfathomable . Since Monday afternoon , I've had this pit in my stomach that feeling you get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 when you wrap disgust , sadness and anger in one big ball. I'm disgusted that from day one the former Mayor felt entitle d to put his own interest s above the interest of each and every citizen he was elected to represent . I'm sad for the city employees who come to work every day, do their job honorably and to the best of their ability and who now have to have this cloud of suspicion hanging over their heads. But most of all, I'm angry. I'm angry that the former Mayor chose to run the city like a mob bus instead of being responsible steward of this government . I'm angry that he did all of this while at the same time throughout the city we have citizens , especially senior citizen s that are struggling to keep their homes. As we heard tonight , we have people whose homes are flooding , their property is being altered because the city doesn't have a system to adequately handle that while homeowners have to watch blighted properties in their neighborhood s become worse and worse and more frequent . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 When you put the struggle -- those struggles plus many more of the resident s throughout this city face every day into the context of what the former Mayor has admitted to in Federal Court, that and all the problem s and investigations involving the school district and the county, it all just quite frankly just pisses me off because we're better than that. I know we are. Throughout my time on this Council , Councilman Gaughan and myself have continually been called and labeled as obstructionists for posing question s to and demanding answers from this administration -- from the former administration . But that is what we were elected to do. That needs to end. We all need to tune out the people who only want to tear people down. Instead , we need to concentrate on picking people up. That is what leadership is. Moving forward , the status quo must change. We must dramatically and fundamental ly change the way this city does business . But we must do it together . We all need to be united in a common cause of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 restoring faith in city government and working in the best interest in each and every resident . That's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Yes, I do. It's almost impossible to describe the range of emotion s I felt since Monday afternoon . Emotions we all have felt from shock and sadness to rage and disgust . When public officials betray the public trust to the degree that was described in detail by U.S. Attorney at his press conference yesterday , it should be disheartening to everyone who truly cares about this city. The feeling s I felt while listening to Mr. Freed's accounting of what was taking place in and around this very building will be with me for the rest of my life. And we can never let something like that happen in this city again. You know, in so many ways we've come so far. We've made some great strides in the last five plus years since I have been on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Council . This City Council has done its very best to be vigilant , transparent, and open. So, yes, condemn the actions of our former Mayor because his actions deserve your condemnation . But also remember the good work of this body and some key members of the administration as well as the many city employees who come to work each day and do their very, very best for all of us. You know, we all have a lot of work to do to restore your trust. And we'll continue to do everything to do just that. You know, we really have no choice. It is our charge now. It is our responsibility . It is our mission because as elected officials at least for now, there is no one else to lead but the five of us. We all love Scranton . We wouldn't be here if we didn't. In fact, you wouldn't be here if you didn't love the City of Scranton . It is our home. It is our city. So it begins today like every day is another chance to make this city a little better. So let's get to work. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. This has been an absolutely devastating week for the City of Scranton , for Lackawanna County, and for I think the whole region. I am personal ly as my colleagues are as well, outraged , sickened , and repulsed by the facts brought forth from the FBI's investigation . I do want to thank the FBI, the Department of Justice , and the U.S. Attorney , Mr. Freed for their investigation . And I was pleased to hear yesterday that the investigation is ongoing. And I think they are forming some sort of task force to combat public corruption in Northeastern Pennsylvania . It's no secret when I first got involve d in politics back in 2013 people assume and now rightly so that the city and this area is corrupt . It's a stench we could never get rid of. And that has always bothered me. And this just confirms that. The blatant corruption that occurred within these walls undermines the good public servants who honestly try to serve this city. And, yes, they do still exist in this building . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I feel very sorry for every taxpayer in this city who must feel cheated and outraged as well. The actions have gone on over the last few years overshadow some of the good things that have actually occurred in this city since 2014. It's important now for this Council to reverse the damage that has been done. At this point, it's my belief that there is a major crisis of confidence in the City of Scranton . While the results of the investigation are horrifying on every level and confidence in local government is at an all time low, I think that this situation actually present s an incredible opportunity to start doing things the right way once and for all. We must restore people's faith that our government works for them that our public officials work for the people and aren't trying to live off of them. One of the first ways that I think we can do this is to ensure that the process for appointing a new Mayor is done openly and done fairly. The appointment process and ultimate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 selection of the new Mayor is the first step in restoring faith and confidence in this city. It's my belief that we should solicit letters of interest and resumes from the public and then conduct public interviews and put these candidates through a vetting process . We all want continuity and stability for the city. And by the end of July, we should install a new Mayor to shepherd through a new era for the City of Scranton . In the caucus preceding this meeting we did hear from Solicitor Minora who laid out several options , whether or not we'll have to have a special election . I did ask that Solicitor Minora put all of his comments into writing . I would like a legal interpretation of all of that before a decision is made. The charter gives us 30 days to appoint a new Mayor. And I do not think there is any reason not to utilize the next few weeks to be as democrat ic in this process as possible with the appointment . Choosing someone for this job should not be rushed at all. We need to make sure that this is done the right way. And we need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 to make sure that whoever this person is is qualified and could do the job. That is so important . We're talking about a city with over 100 million dollar budget every year and 76,000 people. And we are the county seat. I also want to add on that point that I will not be a candidate for this appointment . And I only bring that up because the speculation is driving -- quite frankly driving me nuts as I'm sure it is some other people as well because you have people that want to know what is going on. So I entered a program last year to earn my educational administrative certification . And I'm still enrolled and currently taking classes . So that would preclude me from being a candidate or being a candidate for the appointment or candidate if there is a special election . Finally , during this tumultuous time, we need to do everything in our power to ensure that the city government continue s to operate to address the needs of our resident s and keep the city on track. Also on a secondary point about NRS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 and I had mentioned this to the newspaper when they had called me the other day, I agree that this contract needs to be terminated . Solicitor Minora, I would like you to please review the contract again to see in what way the city can terminate it at this point, what role Council can play in that. I believe we have to give 90 days notice. But I think that should be reviewed if you wouldn't mind. Thank you. I do want to make a point because I had -- you know, when the NRS thing had come out and I read it in the documents provided by the U.S. Attorney , I remembered back to 2015. We had a caucus with Ron Koldjeski who was the Lackawanna County Deputy Director for tax claims. And in that caucus, he discuss ed the collection of delinquent city taxes. And the point that he made was that the county would be willing -- the county Tax Claim Bureau would be willing to be the City of Scranton 's collector of delinquent taxes. And we sent a letter on June 30th to the Mayor asking him to give that -- his consideration and advise Council if he was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 willing to proceed with that appointment because at that time it was my opinion that that would make total sense. You would cut out the middle man. They were willing to do it. They have all the -- they had everything in place to do that and do it correctly . We did not hear from the Mayor. And we had to send a followup letter July 24th at my request . July 29th we received the following letter from the Mayor. "This letter is in response to your letter dated July 24th, 2015, wherein Council inquired into the collection of delinquent city taxes. The City Solicitor and the Business Administrator are still reviewing the viability of appointing the Lackawanna County Tax Claim Bureau as the city delinquent tax collector . I will provide you with more information regarding this matter as it becomes available ." We never received anymore information regarding this matter. And I'm assuming it was never available . Now, four years later this makes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 sense on why you wouldn't want to take the common sense approach and appoint the county Tax Claim Bureau to do that because of all of the things that have gone on between the Mayor and Northeast Revenue Services . But it goes without saying that we cannot in good conscience continue with the contract with NRS. I mean, we had concerns to begin with as it was without all of the facts that were presented . So I actually talked to the Business Administration this morning and he agreed with me on that point. And he's also reviewing how we would get out of that contract . I also think as it relates to the coconspirators and intermediaries , I think any city employee , city official who had anything to do with what went on in this building and outside in regards to bribery , extortion , everything else -- and I don't know if we'll ever know their names, but they should do the right thing and resign immediately . We need to clean house with anybody who had anything to do with what went on here the last four years. And I can't imagine that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 a city employee or anyone else for that matter in business or other entity would have the conscience to come into this building to sign in or punch in or whatever and collect a paycheck and you were a part of that. That is an absolute disgrace . So again, I don't know that we'll ever know who those people were. I know the investigation is ongoing. But I would just say as a matter of doing the right thing, those people should resign immediate ly. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. A couple comments . Obviously , as Council President I've been thrown into this more than others. So on Monday I did have -- and I think it's been well publicized the meeting with Attorney Minora and our City Solicitor regarding the process of filling this appointment for a permanent Mayor. Tuesday , I did have a cabinet meeting with all the members of the cabinet just to be sure that everything continue s to operate as normal within the departments . By and large we have great department heads in the City of Scranton . We have great employees I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 think as all of our colleagues up here have mentioned . And during this time it's critical that the resident s don't have any disruptions . So obviously , that's a top priority at this time. Second priority is obviously appointing a permanent Mayor, whether it be an appointment for six months or an appointment for two and a half years depending on your interpretation of the City Charter and the Administrative Code. Personally , I'm in favor of a short-term appointment and having a special election . If that can be allowed under the code, that's the preference that I have. I think at the end of the day when the voters get to decide who's going to serve the vast majority of the remainder of this term, that's a much better solution than the five of us making that determination . Obviously , there are a lot of inconsistencies between the Home Rule Charter and the Administrative Code. There's different interpretations . I want to thank our solicitor , Attorney Minora and the City Solicitor , Jessica Eskra. Over the last two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 days I have probably spent more time talking to the two of them than anyone else. We want to make sure that this process is done right. We want to make sure it's done by the letter of the law. And at the end of the day if it comes down to a decision by Council personal ly, I want it done in a way where the citizens can have the most say in the process as possible . So as a body, we are going to move forward on putting a process together to get a permanent Mayor appoint ed. In the meantime , I will be continuing to work with all of our department heads in the city on a 24/7 basis whenever needed as Acting Mayor. And I do want to give a thank you to not only all my colleagues who we've had a good working relationship , especially during these last few days trying to come up with a plan on how to get through this, the city employee s and also other elected official s from the county, other municipalities have all reached out to me offering any help that they could provide during this time of transition in the city. So I want to thank everyone who has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 offered their assistance . Residents , I've heard from probably more people in the last two days than I had in the last two years with suggestion s and different ideas. And I definitely want to give a thank you to everyone who's offered up those suggestions and offered to help, whether it's serving on boards, commissions , I've had a lot of inquires . So in summary again, my colleagues have pretty much covered all the points. But in summary , Scranton is a resilient city. Despite what transpired the last two days, the city is going to get through this. We are going to select through an open process a permanent Mayor. There may also be a special election , which I'm hopeful that there will be. But during the meantime , the average Scranton resident is not going to see any change in their quality of life from our services in the city. Employee s are still working . Department heads are still working . And during this time period, I will be spending quite a bit of time at City Hall as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 Acting Mayor making sure that any issues that need to be address ed are addressed . Any major decision s that need to be made during this time I think feel it's more appropriate the permanent Mayor makes those decisions , especially decisions regarding long-term contracts . I know the NRS contract came up. I did ask the solicit or to review that. I know our solicitor is going to review it as well. That's certainly one of many big decision s that are going to be made during the course of the next few months. So again, I just want to give a thank you to everyone that's express ed their support and for my colleagues working through this process . And there will be more to come soon. Thank you. MS.

MR. EVANS: I make a motion to amend Item 7-B per the following : In the now therefore clause, omit the bullet point in its entirety and insert the following : Parking is confined to the following areas and designated spaces on the levels above the ground floor and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 below the uncovered roof of each of these garages . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, could we -- Mr. Evans, can you just explain this again and give a little bit -- MR. EVANS: The whole ordinance ? MR. GAUGHAN : No, not the whole ordinance , just the amendment . MR. EVANS: Okay. Well, the original language stated that the discounted rate was for just areas below the roof. It didn't define exactly where. And I think that the attempt was to push people that were getting the discount all the way up to the upper floors. So what this does is allow anyone that gets the $72 rate to park anywhere from above the ground floor up to the roof level. So it opens up the entire garage, the underutilize d areas of the garage. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? (No response .) MR. ROGAN: All those in favor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR.
