Another thing,aboutthegarbage fee,wehavebeenasking formonths and monthaboutgetting thefigures ,howmuch moneyitcosttooperate thegarbage pickup andhowmuchmoneythepeople arepaying in. It'sreally probably atax,notafee because thentheycanclaimitontheir income tax,butwehaven'tbeenabletoget thosefigures .Youarestonewalling us.We weretoldthatwehavetogotoCourt.Why should wehavetogoandCourtwhenyou're paying abusiness administrator togetthese figures tous.What'shisjob?Wearethe taxpayers,wearepaying yoursalary.We don'thavearighttothosefigures ,wehave1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 togotoCourttogetthem?Idon'tthink so.Idon'tthinksoatall,sowhatarewe supposed todo?Loseourhomes?

Youknow,welookatthisbudget, andIjusthavetoask,whatwasdoneto protectthebestinterest softheresidents ofthiscity?Whatwasdonetoprotect the interest ofthemanyseniors thatwehavein thiscommunity andthemanypoorpeople that wehaveinthiscommunity ?Itdoesn'ttake muchtoseeit,allyouhavetodoisjust walkoutthesedoorsandgothrough the neighborhoods andlookatthecondition of theneighborhoods ,andwhodoweblamefor1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 that,thehomeowners ,ordoweholdour elected officials accountable forthat? Youknow,Ms.Franus talked about thetaxincreases andcertain members of thiscouncil ofbeingapartofthat.The thingthatwesometimes forgetisthat that'sallourelected officials ever understand aretaxincreases because that's theeasywayout.Theproblem isthereis noleadership inthiscityandwehaven't haditinaverylongtime.We'vehadafew leaders inthepast,youknow,wetalked abouttheprevious council andwhatthey did,andIsoundlikeabroken record saying it,butbelieve me,Iadamantly feelvery stronglyaboutthisandIdobelieve that thebestthingthatpastcouncil didwas allowingthatParking Authority togointo receivership because itdid,infact,take awaytheblankcheckbook .

Andherewearenowatthispoint justlootingthelastremaining assets that wehaveleft.Now,wewanttosellthe SewerAuthority .Ridiculous .Thatwasnot theintent ofthatAuthority tobailout thiscitytocoverit'spensions andmeet anyotherobligations .That'snotwhythat1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 SewerAuthority wasimplemented ,butit's justanother easywayoutbecause wehave elected incompetent people thatdon'thave anyideaandvisions oftheirownsonowwe aregoingtosellanasset,theratepayers getscrewed onceagainandtheresidents and taxpayers areleftholding thebag.Arewe evergoingtohaveleadership inthiscity?

Youknow,thefirstthingIhaveheretoday isIreally don'tthinkthesewerdealis completely doneyet,regardless ofwhat council wantstodo.I'djustliketobring upanameofMyronWalcoff whohadthe ability tostopthelastdealwiththeSewer Authority andIthinkthatifeverybody looked intothatagreement theywouldsee whatactually happened andwhyitwasn't stopped . I'djustliketoaskanyattorney in thecommunity oranyproseIguessyou wouldcallthemlitigants orattorneys if theywouldbeinterested instepping forward totryandblockthis.I'llgiveyoumy phonenumber is570-604-1212.Thisis probably theworstdealthiscitycouldever have.Youknow,theprevious budget Ihad whenMr.McGoff washereIpresented council withapetition thatthebudget becutmy301 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 percent andIaskedthesamethingthis time.Thiscityhastocutit'sbudget to getit'shouseinorderandwhenyoutakea lookatdealthattheSewerAuthority that everybody ,youknow,theyarewondering how wearegoingtodivvyallthismoneyup, thereisnomoney,because eventaking all thatmoneywon'tstabilize thepension fund. It'sallmakebelieve .It'sallbeenmake believe hereforalongtime.Ihavebeen atpodium forprobably 20plusyears.I brought upthepension problem thefirst timethatthesupermajority ran.Mr.Rogan wasthere,Imadeitapointtosaythat thatwasthegorilla inthecloset,andI realize howbigthatgorilla is. But,youknow,thesadpartiswe don'tonlylackleadership inthiscitywe lackleadership inourcountry andwherewe aregoingtogoIcan'treally tellyou that.(Mr.Morgan'scellphonerings.) Well,IknowwhereI'mgoing.Butanyhow, lookit,Ijustthinkit'sreally important tofinally realize thatthereisnomoney hereinthecity.Theresidents haveno1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 moneyleft,thedealwithPennsylvania American Water,that'snotadeal.Takea lookatwhatin'68whentheyfounded this Authority theamount ofmoneythatwasspent tocreate itandinvest thatmoneyfor inflation andthenrealize allofthe infrastructure thatgoeswiththatandwhat thecityisactually goingtobeleftwith afterit'sallsaidanddone.Wearestill goingtobeleftwithobligations and liabilities ,andIreally thinktheonlyway toforcethiscitytodosomething isto takethisagreement thatthiscouncil and thismayorwanttopresent asaplantosave thecityandtakeitintoCourtandaskthe Courttostepinandfindoutifthereare legalgrounds toblockthisandtostopthe saleanddemand thatthiscitybeputinto receivership andbringpeople inhere. Myquestion iswhereisMr.Flynn, whereisMr.Farina andwhereisMr.Blake? And,youknow,whenthecitycouldhave filedbankruptcy in2012,somebody hasgot to--ifIwasajudgeIwouldlikesomebody toexplain tomein2012whythiscity1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 didn'tfileforbankruptcy whenitmetall oftherequirements ,butnowwearegoingto turnaround andselltheScranton Sewer Authority andit'sjustridiculous . And,youknow,Ihopethatoverthis recess youreally thecouncil looksatit andwouldprobably saytothemayorthat thisisn'tthedealwewant.Andtobe honest withyou,Ithinkit'stimetostart cutting budgets andstartlaying people off andfacethereality thatyoucouldkeep borrowing moneyuntilyouhitthewalland youcan'tgetanymore andaftertheSewer Authority isgoneit'smyopinion that within fiveyearsthiscitywillfinancially collapse anyhow either undertheweight of incompetence ordebtorbothbecause thisis notthesolution tothisCity'sproblems and itneverwas.Thesolution tothisCity's problems wasoversight ofthebudget andto cutthebudget continually .Nottoraise taxes,buttocutthebudget.Ifyoucan onlyafford 50employees that'showmanyyou have.Ifyoucanafford 30employees that howmanyyouhave,andifyoucan'tfurnish1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 theresidents ofthecitywiththeemployees thatitneedsthenIwouldsaytodeclare a stateofemergency andaskthegovernor to bringpeople inheretotakecareofthe jobsthathavetobedonebecause thetruth ofmatter isthiscityisbroke. And,youknow,Mr.Evans,you brought forwardattheSewerAuthority meeting thatthatdayyoudidn'thaveasuit on,andIappreciate that,butyouknow what,suitsdon'timpress me.Theability tothinkimpress esme,andIdon'treally seeanythought herebecause selling people'sproperties andborrowing hundreds andhundreds andmillions ofdollars doesn't provetomethatoneofyouarealeader. Itjustmeansthatyouareatwo-bit politician andyoudon'tknowthereality of thethings youaredoingbecause youdon't careandwhywouldyoucarebecause nobody inthiscityhascaredfor50yearsplus, andforacitytobedistressed aslongas thisonehasjustgoestoprovehowmuchyou really care.Thankyou.

MS.SCHUMACHER :Goodevening , Council.The11thhoursaleoftheSewer Authority willbemyprimary topicthis evening .Sadly,myconcern thatthe$50 million wasastealwasproved tobe accurate buttherearetoomanyunknowns to rushininjust30days.Idonotwantthe citytojumpataSewerAuthority sale believing ittobeawindfall andfinditto beahumongous liability .Iwill concentrate onwhatIbelieve tobethe largest unknown thatcouldbebecome that humongous responsibility orliability ,that istheissueofstormwaterasindependent stormwatersystems willbethe responsibility ofthecity.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 AtTuesday 'spublic hearing Iasked Mr.Barrett thesizeoftheCity's independent stormwatersystem,thatbeing thestormwaterthatdoesnotcombine with sewage.Mr.Barrettprofessed tonotknow theanswer andthatsentupahugeredflag because infrontofmyhome,andI'msure manyothers homesinthecityaremarkings placed therejustveryrecently ,andthey designate either stormwaterorSSAsoI believe Mr.Barrettshould haveknownthe answer as,again,theywereplaced therein recent months. Theredflagiswhether Mr.Barrett wasbeingcoyandchoosing nottoreveal thisinformation because thenumber and liability oftheproperty owners andthe citywouldhavetobefacedpriortothe saleandnotbeahugewhoops afterthe sale. Onethingisclear,stormwateris thelargest issue,especially intheeast andprobably thewestmountains wherethere isstillmanyopenditches .Currently the City'sliability seemslimited totherepair1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 ofwashoutareasontheroads.Correcting thecauseofthewashoutscouldprovetobe extremely expensive ,probably unaffordable forthecity.Thecityalsoownsmany retention pondsthathavenotbeendredged inaverylongtimeandthatisanother stormwaterissuethatcouldhaverearedits uglyhead.

MR.ROGAN:Thankyou.Anumber of itemstonight .FirstI'mgoingtostartoff withsomething Ididn'tspeakabouttoomuch lastweek.TheSenate Bill76,something thatwehavetalked aboutquiteabitat thismeetings ,unfortunately ,Senate Bill76 whichwouldeliminate theschool portion of yourproperty taxeswasdefeated bythe StateSenate byatievote,andthe Lieutenant Governor cameinandbrokethat tie,hevotedagainst it. Theweekspriorinleaduptothe voteforSenate Bill76,myselfandmany friends,somespeakers atcouncil have1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 mentioned thatpeople should callSenator Blakeandaskhimtosupport Senate Bill76. Ihavespoken tomanypeople whoweretold bySenate Blake'sstaffthathewouldbe supporting Senate Bill76whichwould eliminate yourschool property taxes. Unfortunately ,atthelastminute Senate Blakevotedno. Asyoucantellinthetievote,if Senator Blakewouldhavedonetheright thingforhisconstituents inthiscounty therewouldnotbeschool property taxes. Itwouldbeanentirely different system. Itwouldrelieve theproperty taxburden on senior citizens anditwouldmake homeownership moreaffordable foryoung homebuyers.Ihavetosayalthough Ihave oftencriticized Senator Blakefromthis podium,thisisthemostdisappointed Ihave everbeeninavotebecause hewasthe deciding vote. Moving ontootherissues,the Scranton SewerAuthority privatization plan, anyone whohaswatched thesemeetings over mytenure oncouncil hasknownthatI've1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 longsupported privatizing theScranton SewerAuthority formanyyearsreasons .The mainreason,asCouncilmen Evansmentioned , isI'mafirmbeliever thattheprivate sector canperform theseservices inamuch moreeconomic alandbetter fashion thanthe public sector. Inaddition ,current statelaw allows upgrades onsewerutilities tobe spread amongst autilities entire ratebase, soinstead ofunderthecurrent planwhere iftheSewerAuthority needstodoupgrades, whichtherearemanythatneedtobedoneto theChesapeake BayEPAstandards .Those upgrades underthecurrent system wouldbe paidforbytheratepayers intheCityof Scranton andintheBorough ofDunmore .In aprivatization plan,whenawatercompany comesintheycanspread thatincrease over alloftheratepayers throughout theentire stateofPennsylvania .Soyoucancertainly seehowthe$350million savings tothe ratepayers cancomeabout. Ialsohaveconcerns aboutstorm water,aswasmentioned bythesomeother1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 individuals ,butwearegoingtohaveto dealwiththestormwaterwhether theSewer Authority isprivatized orwhether it'skept inpublic hands.Unfortunately ,because Scranton isaveryoldcityandwhenthe sewersystemswereputintheywerecombined sewersystems whereyoursewage fromyour toilet andthewaterrunofffromthesideof yourhouseallcombined intothesamesystem andweretreated.Itobviously makesno sensetotreatrainwaterinthesamemanner thatyouaretoilet wateristreated .So something needstobedonetoseparate those systems tomeetfederal requirements regarding theEPAandthatisgoingtobea longprocess soweallneedtomakesureto follow what'sgoingonandhowexpensive that'sgoingtobeandhaveagoodstorm watermanagement plan. Iwasveryencouraged whenmeeting withSewerAuthority officials andthose involved withthedealthattheremaybe opportunities forresidents tomitigate that impact.Therewasjustaverygoodarticle intheScranton Timesregardingthelibrary1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 capturing therainwater.Manygardeners throughout thecitycaptured theirrain waterforreusetowatertheirgardens . Thatisnotonlygoodfortheenvironment , butitmakescomplete economic senseto recycle rainwaterwhenever wecan.So that'ssomething thatIhopethatwillbe incentived within thisplan. Regarding privatization ingeneral , forfiveyearsnowIhavelongtalked about theprivatization oftheSewerAuthority , thesaleoftheparking garages ,andfinally theprivatization ofourDepartment of Public Works.Iamveryhopeful thatthe nextstepinthesethreewouldbethesale oftheparking garages whichhavebeen talked about.Iknowthereisproposals withleasing orsaleand,finally ,the Department ofPublic Worksshould alsobe privatized .Nottheentire department ,but therefuse division .Something Ihave talked aboutagainformany,manyyears. Although ,thatdepartment hasimproved drastically underthecurrent administration ,Iamafirmbeliever that1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 refuse canbepicked upinacheaper and moreefficient manner byaprivate hauler thanbycityemployees . Finally ,I'djustlike,again,to wisheveryone aHappyHanukkah ,aMerry Christmas ,andaveryHappyNewYear.I willhavecomments ofafewagenda items, butthatisallfornow.Thankyou.
