MCANDREW : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I just have one comment on the overtime report. Taking a look, this year was budgeted a little more accurately than last year. Some of the takeaways , the LIPS Department had a slight increase from last year but it was budgeted more accurately . DPW administration is still over budget. It's at about 202 percent this year down from 729 percent last year. So a little bit more accurate . Engineering , again, more right on the money. But we'll see what it looks like after December . DPW highways is up last year 139,000 more. We haven't included December yet. We're looking at our garages . The line item we budgeted at 25,000 last year. It was budgeted at 60,000 this year. So although it's within budget, it is 34,000 up from last year. One question I had, Mr. Voldenberg if we could send correspondence over the Mr. West was, the month of November had the most spent in overtime . If we could just look into what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 the reasoning was for the high overtime in the month of November when we haven't had any weather events yet? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That's all. MR. MCANDREW : Received and filed. Any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a couple of quick ones. First, I just want to announce that this week there was a code blue alert issued by the Mayor. And that was for Monday, today, Wednesday and Thursday . So that occurs when the temperatures drop below 20 degrees . And for anyone who is homeless or needs a place to stay, they can find Weston Field house over on Providence Road to be open for them to be housed there. That's between the hours of 8:00 at night and 7 a.m., in the morning . And I also just wanted to wish everyone happy holidays as we approach Hanukkah , Quanza, and Christmas . And that's all that I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? MR. KING: Mr. McAndrew , I just have a few things. Number one, I apologize for not being here. Like many people in our area there's (inaudible ) for the last four days. So I appreciate you allowing me to call in for this meeting . I'd like to open up by congratulating Gerald Smurl on being named to Scranton City Council . He's going to be a great addition . He's going to do a tremendous job. And I really look forward to working with him on Council . Also, I want to wish everyone happy holidays , remind everyone to make sure they get out and visit Nay Aug Park, the beautiful display at Nay Aug Park. Downtown Scranton is decorated beautifully around the courthouse and down along Biden Street also Moosic Street as well as Prospect Avenue. Thank you, Mr. Smurl, absolutely beautiful . It's great that we do this for the children and adults for our community . I also want to just wish everyone health and happiness over the holiday season. And don't be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 embarrassed to wear a mask because a lot of people are getting seriously ill either Covid or influenza , the younger kids RSV. So it's going around. I just think it's important . If you feel you need to wear a mask, wear it. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? So I would also like to welcome you aboard. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Congratulations . I would also like to wish everybody whatever you celebrate , Happy Quanza, Hanukkah , Merry Christmas , Happy New Year, everybody . Have a healthy and happy holiday season. Next up our friends at Friends of the Poor and Family to Family food basket program will be having their annual Christmas food basket giveaway . It's Tuesday , December 20th from 9 a.m., to 4 p.m. It's drivethrough or walkup at the Scranton Cultural Center, 420 North Washington Avenue, Scranton , PA. And that is all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. MCANDREW : First on the list is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Mrs. Joan Hodowantiz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Tom, do we have a draft audit yet? MR. SCHUSTER : That we do not and in Fifth Order I'll give you an update with the audit. MS. HODOWANITZ : None of you were on Council when Bill Courtright became Mayor. When Doherty left, unfortunately there had only been one person in the BA's office who had don audit prep work. And she left with Mayor Doherty . So after 17 months in June of 2015, Council at that time approved a resolution to hire Rainey and Rainey, CPs for audit preparation services . The original resolution called for a four year contract . But they amended it to limit it to two years because it was considered sufficient time to train the personnel in the BA's office to do that work. Mr. Gaughan voted against it for several reasons . He felt that the staff should be able to do the work without being trained . He sounded like another way to fund a full-time position . And the Mayor -- Mayor Courtright 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 had already added a position and increased salaries and increased the professional services budget to $130,000 to include training . And he felt that they should go with PEL's recommendation to use college interns to do the audit prep work. Well, two years have passed. It's now seven and a half years later and we still have Rainey and Rainey. But the plot thickens. I got a copy of Kohanski 's contract and the RFP under which they were hired. And they were hired to do the audits from 2018 through 2021, all four audits were late, very late. This is the paragraph -- the work plan in the RFP, quote, the City of Scranton is subject to debt requirements for audit completion . Specific debt covenants require the completion of the audit by June 30th of the subsequent fiscal year. The City of Scranton recognizes this time schedule may present difficulties due to the scope of the audit responsibilities . But the City also expects the firm to dedicate sufficient resources to the completion of the work on a timely basis. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 If the audit is not completed by September 30th of the subsequent fiscal year, the City of Scranton may assess a 10 percent annual cost penalty on the contractual cost of the audit for the fiscal year in question if minimally a draft audit was not delivered by the September 30th completion date. The City presently uses an accounting firm -- that's Rainey and Rainey to assist with audit preparation duties to prepare information for the auditor . So I have a couple questions . Have we ever assessed a penalty on Kohanski ? And if not, why not? MR. SCHUSTER : I don't think we've assessed a penalty on them. MS. HODOWANITZ : See, what I'm going to do tomorrow is, I'm going to do another right to know request . I'm going to request the names and addresses of all our current bond holders. And I'm going to write them a little letter with a few attachment s and ask them, you know, how does this -- the lateness of these audits year after year after year after year affect the debt covenants ? Let's see what they say. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 I don't think the administration takes the audit at all serious ly. There is no rational e for paying Rainey and Rainey year after year and they can't get a trial balance by September 30th. You could have the University of Scranton professors come down here and teach you how to do it. You could have their student s come down even do it for you. This is not excusable . And why you tolerate it year after year and I complain year after year, I don't understand . But I'm going to push this. Before I run out of time, any movement on the union contracts ? MR. MCANDREW : What I said to you last week is the latest I heard. I haven't heard any different . MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, great sense of urgency on the part of the administration . Thank you and Merry Christmas . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. You too. Next on the list, Mr. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Council -- Jerry, you and I aren't friends and probably never will be. But I have no argument presently with you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 on Council . This is how I am. You'll learn that just over a period of time. I read in Jeff's interview one of your goals is keeping parks clean and so on and ridding the neighborhoods of blight. That's baloney . Baloney . This Council -- this inept Mayor and her total administration of friends and support ers have no time or interest in helping you. I've heard a dozen people talk about blight. Nothing has been accomplished . Mayor could find 4 million dollars for the developers ' property downtown but nothing for the swimming pool project . And that reminds me, I'd like to know what person and what authority they had to scrap that $200,000 slide. When that happened I think scrap was about 8 cents a pound. I bet we didn't even get any money out of it. That's Scranton . The worst thing that could happen to a homeowner is to have some slumlord buy a property in your neighborhood . That's what happened to me. The first thing that happens happened next door. They -- he threw out the tenant that he had for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 not paying rent and everything in the world they owned including a piano, everything . They lived like 50, 60 feet away from me. Of course, when the crowds come there was rubbish everywhere . Mr. 0leski and Mr. Sunday gave me a ticket. I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't on my property . But he didn't give Mr. Gonzales that owns the house a ticket. Of course, the people were gone. They didn't get a ticket. I got a $200 ticket to go January 10th to court. You know, the first thing that happens , these people have -- they have nothing to lose. These garbage tenants that move in one after another after another . They start -- I got cars parked on the front lawn. I've had that house over 25 years. Nothing in my whole neighborhood -- nobody's parked on the front lawn but the filth that got the house next door to me. You know how that depreciates our neighborhood ? They've already turned it into a big sloppy mud hole after last week. Then there's the radio player. There's people I've never see. They're renting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 rooms out or something . Last weekend there was seven cars in my backyard -- well, their backyard . This is -- this is no more than an illegal rooming house. Henry Gonzales just destroyed my neighborhood after 25 years, I'll tell you. It's probably going to get worse too. It's just started . They've only been there a couple weeks, the next door people. Maybe when I go to court on the 10th I'll show the real Bidenville through some picture s I've taken in my neighborhood , abandoned cars for years on streets and so forth. That's why I sincere ly feel that Scranton just stinks from the sour stench of wrath, corruption , and inaction . This is the Scranton that I live in. They've raised my house insurance twice because it's worth less than it was -- oh, I don't know, five or six years ago they kept raising it up. Now, they say it's worth half as much. It's the City's fault. It's Oleski's fault for not having nobody to take care of my neighborhood . Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Ellman. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Would anybody else like to speak? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I didn't have -- Happy Holidays to all of you and whatever you celebrate . Hopefully it will be a peaceful , quiet and relatively snow free holiday -- enough to make it Christmassy , but not enough to breaking your back shovelling . I took a look at the street signs and the note from DPW. And I haven't had time to research it. But I understand that Minichi , Inc., I guess from Dupont got the contract in 2022. I'm not sure if it was ever brought before this body that the street signs at DPW were supposedly doing themselves were contracted out to a subcontractor . I figured that if the budget was approved by grants and if DPW is suppose d to do it, then DPW would have been the people involved in it. And if there was a contract deal, it would have come back here. There may have been and I'm unaware of it. In 2001, they added a third full-time traffic team employee specifically for the sign work. They said, of course, they're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 short-staffed because they're always short-staffed . Everyone is always short-staffed it seems. But in 2001 as I said, they added a third position specifically for the street signs. Why do we need a new position for the street signs if we just turned around and subcontracted it out? DPW floater , his explanation in that position has a lot of corporate speak. And Mr. West is extremely good at corporate speak. Due to bandwidth needs. My street signs always have bandwidth needs. Way finding signage; our fixed signage infrastructure . Do we have unfixed signage infrastructure anywhere ? They are very nice words. They sound good. They sound important . They fill up the request . But they actually mean nothing . He has a software program that's called Tracks that is sunsetting . Surprisingly enough, we find out that it needs to be redone. We need to get something else because it's no longer supported . Like everything else in this government body, we don't have a plan for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 technology going forward . We don't have a forward looking position working through Synergy because we get contracts that have been expired . We get equipment that comes up where they say we need new equipment for this because we can't upgrade the old equipment after the fact that it is no longer available and no longer useable . It becomes an emergency because no one knows what's out there. No one plans for it. And at the very end, it gets tossed to the highest bidder picked by the administration . I have no idea why street signs need a specific program . We have an IT Department . There is something called an access database or even an Excel spreadsheet . I understand that this is going back to high technology of the 1980s that could be done by a high school student . I'm not sure why we need a high tech program to tell us what street signs are out there and what need to be replaced when they were replaced and when is the plan for new ones. That is a simple spreadsheet . And we've hired an IT Director to do specifically 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 that. OpenGov should do that on the drop of a hat. But we need a new program . Why do we keep looking for services elsewhere and not looking in-house? If our IT Department can't do IT, then why do we have an IT Department ? I understand he's overburdened . But some things just shouldn 't be outsourced . Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Anyone else? MS. KOLOSKI : Hi, first I want to congratulate Mr. Smurl for his appointment . And I'm here again on the behalf of the residents of the Nay Aug Park area and the expansion of the hospital . I was here a couple meeting s ago where I -- Mr. Kyle said he did not -- Kyle Donahue said he did not receive our letter that we e-mailed him even though it has never come back to us. And he said to reach out to Don King and he would reach out to Don King. And if you remember , I read the letter and handed it in -- up there on your bench there. So I never heard back again from Don King. So I called him and I -- he said he already sent it up to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 county. He rewrote it. He changed across the street from me to institutional with a capping of 45 feet, which was a pretty good thing. But the 200 block which our letter stated that we wanted -- first of all, we wanted mixed residential kept at 45 feet. He -- the 200 block was left as civic. They changed it from 125 feet to 100 feet. But it's still way too high for the people that have been coming here and speaking about the 200 block. I mean, yes, even if we were going to be satisfied with our end, it's not fair to the rest of the people. We're representing the people on the 200 block and the 400 block. Now our question -- main question is, how did this happen? Again, we were left out of the discussion . We sent in a letter which everybody said they didn't receive and one went to Don King also and he said he didn't receive it. I hand-carried one in. And what happened is they made these decisions . I don't know how if it was Don King must have rewrote the zoning and sent it up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 but never contacted the neighbors again. It was always like it was dictated what to write by the hospital and then just sent in. We were left out of the whole process once again. We felt they should have come to us and told us what they were planning on doing. I mean, I thought the dialogue was suppose d to be open between the neighborhood and the hospital and the City Council and Don King. So one thing because we don't understand how all of this was and who wrote it and who changed it and why we weren't consulted or had another meeting with the hospital with it all, we would like to know if the next Council meeting if Don King can be present so that the Council can hear and we can hear exactly what's going on. Now, when -- I'm going to mention what that other gentleman mentioned about the blight which I hadn't planned on speaking about at all. But in the middle of my block today I was walking by and I saw the tax notice -- a back tax notice pinned on 421 Colfax Avenue. I have been talking about 421 Colfax Avenue for about 10 years now. It's owned by Jonathan Olivetti . I believe he's in jail in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Philadelphia for stealing client's money, but I don't want to say that on record because I'm not sure. But that's what the whole thing was when we called. We had asked the City going back before when the mayors were first running the first time if they could do something about pulling that down because that's the only sidewalk today that I had trouble getting over with my walker because of the ice there. Nobody takes care of it except sometimes the neighbors will come and try to pick up crap on the grass because nobody takes care of it. I had thought that he had at one time had it under contract with the hospital . But it seems that maybe because he's in jail in Philadelphia that maybe none of that went through and then they changed their mind about our side of the block anyway. But there's no one taking care of it. It's filled with rodents and creatures of all kinds. And now they pinned up a thing about he has to pay his back taxes again, but nobody does anything about it. So I would love for somebody to be able to check into that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 I do know that he has -- I don't know if it's a brother or a cousin or an uncle who is also an attorney in Scranton . And I don't know if there is any family you could check into on that. But why that is still allowed to stand in that condition , it's a fire hazard. People throw things in the backyard walking through the alley, bags of dog poop and stuff -- not the nice people in the neighborhood . So we would like to have that looked into. And I see my time is up. So Merry Christmas . And I do want to mention the celebration that I just heard on TV that President Biden signed the Marriage Equality Act of the respectful marriage . And I would like to just say wonderful , wonderful , wonderful . It's not enough, but it's a first step. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , could you inquire about that property -- the said property that she spoke of and the sidewalk . MR. VOLDENBERG : 421 Colfax, I got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 it, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Also, you know, it's not a bad idea -- I think Mr. King was going to come in at some point. Let's after the holidays see if we can get him in here for an update. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Also, Mr. Voldenberg , can we see if we can get a copy of that letter that Doris was talking about? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll see if I can, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thanks. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . And Joan probably raised enough hell over the audit, but I think that's been going on for years and every year it's later and later. It has to be clamped down on. That's just how you -- how do you decide what you need next year when you don't even know what happened last year? Pension , FTX CEO was arrested today in the Bahamas . And that's just my concern . I did read that we lost money. And I would hope 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 that you would keep an eye on and possibly even get a caucus going after the first of the year to make sure that we're not going to the wash. That was a big part of our -- very large part of our economic problems here. And I remind you that we're also at 38 percent tax exempt. Some of the stuff going up on Colfax Avenue is part of it and several other institutions have taken taxable property off the rolls. And somewhere the citizens won't be able to pay for it. And that's when you get the tax lien on your house and that it's up for sale. It came to my attention that we're giving out grants and loans and loan grants and so forth. And before the Supreme Court today, there is once again a hearing on whether you -- a business should be able to refuse business on their religious or ideological grounds. And if we're giving out grants, I think it should be written into the contract that they cannot turn away business , especially if it's our money that we lent them to go into business . And we don't want to bake you a wedding cake because you're a same sex couple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 or you're a mixed race couple or you're this or that. Anything short of a Jewish bake shop that -- being asked to put a swastika on the top of a cake should be fair game. And that's it. And they shouldn 't ask for a grant if that's going to be their attitude . That's all there is to it. Nothing else. And I think it would be fair if it was written into the loan grant or payroll protection plan or whatever that future ones that they have to serve the public. They have to serve the public. And once again, that leachate issue, reverse osmosis , the money goes up to the landfill . The pollution runs down into Nay Aug gorge. Please stand against it with two feet or if you have to grow two more, do it. That's unacceptable to pollute the Nay Aug gorge for somebody 's fun and profit. And we're giving out an education grant. And in New York there's some yeshivas -- it doesn't have anything to do with religion are not teaching standard subjects even though they're -- some of their subject matter should be reviewed .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 They shouldn 't be using that money to push their religion . It should be standard subjects . And that should be optional . That's how it was up at the U. I don't know how it is now and hooligan s and contrarians . Somebody made a mention about harvesting democrats . I have no choice but to vote for a democrat because the republicans want to see me sleeping down along the river taking away Social Security , Medicare and what have you which I was promised and taxed for. Thank you. Have a good night. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . I really hadn't planned to talk about much business tonight . But I did go up to Nay Aug Park this afternoon to see how the -- one of the memorial trees that had been planted for someone that used to come here to Council and speak a lot and see how they decorated it. And so we went up and it was painful . We went up the street and looked down at the 200 block Colfax Avenue. And it was just very depressing . I was up there not too long ago. And there were some structures left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 But now it's gone -- the down side. And then we go into the Nay Aug by itself and you get up by the -- just before the former zoo and we still have guides to the swim complex . I mean, that's like putting vinegar on a cut. We don't have a swim complex . And I don't see why there should be a sign that says we do. And I also would like to know how the whole issue of the park benches that had been bought for memorial purposes has been handled . And I want to make sure that they stay there and it not be the choice of one person to do what she wants to do. So and then too, I guess, sort of up there because it's seems to me that what's on 8-A on the agenda is still sitting there and getting moldy because you couldn't reach the proper conclusions . So it was easier instead of working it out, it sits there. All the stuff that this woman talked about from neighborhood of Nay Aug seems to me should be in 8-A. And I just am astounded that such things that belong in code stuff have been happening without the Council even looking at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 it and certainly the affected public. And I would ask one thing over your vacation holidays here that we all stay safe and I would ask you also though to give some thought to the Home Rule Charter . It really should be reviewed . It's 20 years old. A lot of things have changed , not just in the City itself but in technology . And I think two decades is sufficient to wait. And it doesn't mean that something tragic is going to happen. It means it's going to be reviewed . It could come back in with the same thing and people would talk about it and they could vote on it instead of having it jammed down our throats . So thank you and have a Merry Christmas and healthy happy new year. And we'll see you next year. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Would anybody else like to speak? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. Motions . MR. MCANDREW : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Not at this time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. I have several different updates . We got a lot of question s last week. And thanks to Mr. Voldenberg we did get a lot of answers. So I'm going to try to go through each of them one by one. So looking back into Rainey and Rainey, myself and Mr. Gaughan made a request going back to September of last year. And the answer that we got was that paying Rainey and Rainey less than $10,000 for their assistance is more beneficial than hiring another full time accountant at the minimum salary of $45,000 plus benefits to focus specific ally on audit preparation . So that was an answer that came in. But I did inquire again about the audit. Like I said, I did meet to try to get the City and the auditors at the same table to work this out. I did not get an update from the City. But I did get an update from the auditor again. So they said on October 6th I requested a meeting to get the audit back on track. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 But I was unable to get it scheduled until October 27th. At the meeting they were provided with correcting entries for the general fund trial balance for problems noted on the October 3rd e-mail. And October 22nd at the meeting they explain ed to Larry West that the first opening on the audit schedule will be for the week of November 28th. So on November 28th, they spent a few days at City Hall. And some of the things that were still pending were general fund audit testing . They should have most of this by this week. They had several problems at OECD. Special city's audit testing is still in process . They've had some problems auditing capital assets since the reporting in the new software is different than what they were given in previous years. They still need updates on the GASB 75 report. And this was something that I even sent an e-mail to the HR Department to have this prepared in preparation for this year as it occurs every few years, the Scranton Sewer Authority but six items that they've listed that they still need finalization for on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 that. Next is the Rec Authority . So there was a question asked last week about the Rec Authority funding . I know there was -- I think the total project was 320,000 with a $200,000 grant. We did get an answer again, thanks to Mr. Voldenberg . Mr. Gattens let us know that the Rec Authority has raised $150,000 towards the playground . This was accomplished mostly through grassroots fund-raising , 5-K races, craft fairs, book sales and, of course, donations . They plan on raising additional monies once they have an artist rendering . And there would be capital fundraising campaign utilizing area business and private donors. Their goal is to reach $250,000. So that's the Rec Authority funding . Let's see. Moving onto some of Miss Schumacher 's inquiries . First, the -- we did get an update on the Nossman {phonetic } contract for the lobbyist . They did give us a list of some of their activities . We'll put it into Third Order next week. After the meeting if you'd like a copy of that I could provide you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 with a copy of that. But they worked on a variety of funding opportunities in 2022. There's about 11 or 12 different activities or actions that they've taken which we can get into third order next week. You could take a review of those. But they did give us an update of that. With the LERTA we asked several questions about the LERTA. How is the City judging the success of the LERTA program , any metrics that they've used. And the answer we got from Eileen Cipriani was the initial ordinance did not establish metrics for evaluation . OECD has tracked LERTA applications and outcome . The City has seen an increase in commercial project s. But it's difficult to establish the role the LERTA played with these project s versus other incentive s that are in place in the city and state. Second question with the LERTA was can we have a list of instances where we have applied for programs . From 2018 to 2021 there were 32 applications , 11 of them were commercial , 21 residential , 15 were approve d, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 3 are pending , 3 denied, and 12 had no followthrough . And in 2022 there was 23 applications . So 14 of them were commercial and 9 were residential , 3 were approved , 16 are pending, 3 denied, and 1 withdraw . That also will be in Third Order next week. And if you'd like a copy you could have a copy of that tonight . The Scranton Sewer Authority escrow, so we have escrow easement as of 10/31/22 was $3,935,439.69, Black Rock, FNCB and the indemnity escrow as of 10/31 was $4,344,436.17 in Delaware Trust. The City's tax appeal representative is Joe O'Brien. And we did -- Mr. Voldenberg was kind enough to reach out to DEP. We got three quarters of the leachate studies , quarter one, two, and three which we could have printed . We are still waiting on an answer for the Nay Aug master plan. And I think that should cover all of your questions from last week. That's all, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Dr. Rothchild , do you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, none at this time. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: No, I do not at this time. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Well, I have one. You know, I've been forwarding questions about Weston Field pool. So I'm happy to report out I have an update that I got from Director Duffy. And here it follows : So we have an appointment letter ready for one or two new lifeguards ready just waiting on some of the documents . The other we are working a schedule -- scheduled certification course. Once they get back to us to confirm their willing ness to obtain a certification because they are yet to certified . The pool is open five days a week in December . And increased hours from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes six on Thursday s for Family Swim Night. They've also had Scranton Electric here for the pool heater on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 following dates: 11/15, 11/21, 12/5, 12/7. They have ordered the parts for the failing ignition . These parts are on backorder. I'm assured that the pool temperature is usually between 84 and 88. And during the heater issues, the temperature has never fallen below 80 degrees . So that's all I have right now. And it looks like there is some progress being made at Weston Park. And that is all I have, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.
