MINUTES OF THE ETHICS BOARD REGULAR MEETING HELD OCTOBER 24, 2019. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. ROGAN: Are there any comments on the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have announcements at this time? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I just have one statement I'd like to make. I usually would reserve this for Fifth Order. But I just want to take a second at the top of the meeting to mention something , something about the retirement of our City Controller Roseann Novembrino . When I first got involve d in politics back in 2013, Mrs. Novembrino was one of the first people that was willing to take the time and talk with me. As a City Controller , her door was always, and I mean always open. You didn't need an appointment . You didn't need to send an e-mail. And you certainly did not need to make a phone call. As City Controller , she was the epitome of what a good public servant should be, always willing to take the time, answer questions and listen to people. We often talk in these chambers and across the City about how important it is for public servants to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 selfless . Well, Mrs. Novembrino was just that. Time after time she could have received a raise in that position . But she turned it down time after time. She always looked out for every single one of her employees who held her in the highest regard. And I know that from talking with some of them over the last few years and just in the last few days. And she always did what was best for the City. She was and still is revered in this building and across the City for her decades of service that she gave to Scranton . You will not find a kinder, more compassionate , dedicated person than Roseann Novembrino . And I want to wish her well in her retirement . I want to wish her well with her health. And I want to thank her for all that she has done. And her family should be very proud of her service to the City. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? A couple announcements , next Monday at 5:15 a public hearing will be held for the City's 2020 operating budget. Also next week, the week of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 November 25th through the 30th, newspapers will not be picked up. DPW employees will be picking up leaves next week. Bagging of leaves is suggest ed. Leaf bags are free for resident s and may be picked up at DPW headquarters on Poplar Street or at the Weston Firehouse on Providence Road. Again, leaves will be picked up, not newspapers the week of November 25th. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers spoke on agenda items and matters of general concern : Mayor Evans Less Spindler John Bravo Dorothy Dietrich Joan Hodowanitz Fay Franus Dave Dobrzyn Len Srebro Bob Bolus Lee Morgan Marie Schumacher .) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Just briefly . We received the budget on Friday. I just had a chance to go over it this morning . So I have as many questions as Joan has provided to us. A lot of my questions are listed in Joan's questions and I have many more. But on the refuse fee, the problem with that is the way -- logistically is so it's broken down by parcel. So, for example , if there's a homeowner that has two parcels , they're going to pay double the fee. So that's one of my -- one of the issues I have with that. So, for example , so I have two parcels . I have one with a -- I get two separate tax bills. I have one with -- that my house is on. And I have one that just gets a land value tax bill. So that's going to come in double the fee. And that's, you know, all over the City. It's actually going to affect -- negatively impact, I believe , the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 land bank too. The idea of the land bank was, you know, you have vacant property in between two properties . You split the property in half. There is different pin numbers . And you get billed differently . So that's one of the -- I just think it needs to be worked out. But I will be putting together a list of my questions and providing them to the administration hopefully that we can get an answer on. That's all I have tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Attorney Dempsey , any motions or comments ? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes, thank you, Mr. Rogan, I do. Good evening , everyone , and thank you for attending . I would like to thank Mayor Evans for coming to see us tonight . I as well have a dear family member struggling with cancer at the present time. And I echo his sentiments as well as those of Mr. McGoff. Be a friend if and when you can to anybody struggling in any situation . I'd also like to give my accommodation s to Mrs. Novembrino . While I did not know her personal ly, everyone I have spoken to about her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 has held her in the highest regard and I wish her nothing but happiness and health in her retirement . I'd like to make a motion at this time -- first let me preface it. I've been thinking more and more about grants for this City. And I understand we do have a full-time grant writer who does a lot of work for the police and the DPW who is really nothing but exceptional according to all account s that I've been given. But I have to think for a City coming out of financial distress as well for a City that has so much historical architect ure and maybe even dire need of infrastructure repairs that there isn't more out there for us. So, well, I'm not sure I could effectuated it, ideally I'd like to see a part time or full-time grant writer written into this coming budget. So I'm going to make a motion at this time that we send a letter to the Office of Economic and Community Development . What I'd like to know is over the last three years the types of grants the City has received , from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 who we received them, and for what use they went for. And then once we received those maybe I could use that and our team up here can use that to make further determinations . MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Thank you. I want to update people on the payroll tax conversion . I was at a meeting on November 12th. It was a very well attended meeting in Mayor Evans's office. Mayor-elect Cognetti was there. Mr. Bulzoni was there. Solicitor Eskra was there. Reps of PEL were there. And reps of the Scranton School District were there including their solicitor . I consider that a very productive meeting that answered many of the question s I had on that going forward . While I am not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 sure I am going to be here to vote on that if and when the time comes, I remain convinced that this is the right way for the City to move. As it stands now relative to the Scranton School District , it does go back to their board to make further determination s and decisions . But for the time that I remain here I am going to closely monitor that. I attended an Ethics Board meeting with Joan. I think it was two weeks ago. I again want to commend them for their continuing service to this community . I heard a lot of the logistics that you have to do and they were logistics that I don't think a lot of people even thought of. I hear what you're saying about the budget. I don't know if and what we can effectuate . But I'm going to take a second look at that for you as well. This may not be a popular opinion in this room, especially to Mr. Bolus and a couple other people. But I attended a Recreation al Authority meeting as well. And honestly , I was very impressed by what I saw up there. Those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 men are a group of doers. There's people who are talkers . They get up and talk and talk and talk. These men talk and then do. And they not only do it, they do it themselves . They have great ideas this year for Nay Aug Park. And I think they are really trying to create a revitalization of the park. I'm 53. I have very, very fond memories of that. This year they're going to have horse-drawn carriage rides. They're going to have a planted tree memorial . They're hanging up new wreaths . They're going to have the winter lights all updated and they're going to have horse-drawn carriage lights. So it's hard to look at them and say they're not doing much in my perspective . So I want to commend and thank them as well. I want to note my ongoing -- concern maybe is a strong word, my ongoing attention to the signing of the Ethics Code. I signed mine in the office this week. To me there is no question that the Collective Bargaining Agreements and the people who are members of the union do not really have a great argument 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 in this regard. I have cited it before and I will cite it again, the section that specifically states if there is any conflict , the Collective Bargaining Agreements trump. So there's really not much to read through . As long as you could read the English language , I think it's very clear. It's very, very important to me that we have that code signed by all of our employees . After what this City has gone through in the course of the last six to nine months, if we can't have people working here including us five, we're going to follow the letter of the law and we're going to act in an ethical manner, we've done nothing . So I'm going to ask the administration to take a somewhat strong approach to that and hopefully we're going to get all those signed as soon as possible . With my ongoing garbage fight with delinquencies , I'm aware that there was a meeting last week with our solicitor and an administrative represent ative -- it might have been their solicitor actually , I take that back from NRS. I do not have an update on that. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 have certainly asked for it but has not been provided to me. If I have that next week I will advise. And I'm also asking them and I have not received an explanation or an answer yet when we're going to sending out the RFQ because ideally we don't want to lose any monthly income for the collection of delinquencies . And I'd like to have that up and running as soon as possible . Regarding the audit, Mr. Gaughan and I were speaking about that earlier -- or late last week or earlier today. And we sent an e-mail to Mr. Bulzoni . And he did get back to us just today. We're concerned that that's not ready as of yet. And I think two dates were given, maybe Mr. Donahue had gotten a date of November 1st. I had been given a date of December 1st. But the e-mail was asking very simply when will the audit be ready for review. And Mr. Bulzoni 's response to us is that he's not changed his requirement to have it -- very least a draft by December 1st. I don't expect it sooner. They indicated they may need to restate a component of the 2017 audit but I do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 not have any addition al detail. We continue to monitor that. If we don't have more detail I'd say by next week or definitely by our following meeting , I'm going to ask for something in writing so that -- something more detailed in writing so that we can follow up on that. Mr. Donahue brought up a good point in caucus. I would really like to see that audit before I make any strong decisions on the budget. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motion or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First, just on the issue of the MS4 permit and stormwater management, I would like to ask if Council can request a caucus before the end of the year with the City Engineer , the City Planner and Herbert Rowland and Grubic to give us an update on the City's MS4 permit application , pollution reduction plan and the feasibility of managing stormwater on a regional basis. Back in the summer of 2019, City Council passed a contract legislation , entered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 into a contract with HRG who would work with the City directly on its pollution reduction plan which is a key step in complying with the pollution reduction requirement s imposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The firm at that time the way it was explained to us was to help the City determine the best management practice s. It should implement and maintain its MS4 permit. So I do think, you know, the other thing that they were also going to work with the City on was exploring the feasibility and benefits of managing stormwater on a regional basis. So I think again before the end of the year I think we should have a public caucus and be briefed on that. We keep getting updates kind of piecemeal . I think it would be best if we got everybody on the same page and in the same room. As for Mr. Srebro's issue that's been ongoing now for the last few years, Mrs. Reed, if we can again send something to the DPW ask for another meeting with Mr. Srebro and all the parties involved and revisit this. I know I just can't understand at this point why -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 what seems like a simple fix can't be taken care of. So again, Mr. Srebro, we'll try to get a meeting together and try to get that taken care of. We did receive the self-audit and all the backup to the self-audit from Police Chief -- Fire Chief DeSarno so Council will be in the process over the next few days of reviewing that. Also, I wanted to mention earlier today in our caucus we had members of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency; DPW official s, Dennis Gallagher , the Department Director ; Chris Jenkins , a foreman and some other representative s from different agencies across the state. And, Mrs. Schumacher had brought this up earlier tonight . As a result of that August 15th, 2018 storm, 11 counties and their associated political subdivision s including our County of Lackawanna were declared for the FEMA Public Assistance Program . That program is a reimburse ment program that provides federal funding to help communities respond to and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 recover from federally declared disasters . Those two agencies reimbursed state and local government s and certain types of private nonprofit organizations for the cost of disaster -related debris removal, emergency protect ive measures to protect life and property and permanent repair work to damaged or destroyed infrastructure . The City actually took in quite an amount of damage. For the removal and disposal of storm-related debris and emergency services , we're claiming a little over a million dollars worth of damage. The restoration of damage infrastructure rose, pump stations , flood control gates, we're claiming nearly 1.3 million dollars . So we have a total claim of nearly 2 and a half million dollars and there's eligible management costs. Right now the City has receive d $156,709.54. These project s over the next few months will be ongoing . As I mentioned to you earlier tonight, they are working close with the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission because of some concerns with the wildlife in the water. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Mr. Jenkins who was here tonight who has done by all account s a really, a great job and kind of putting everybody together and bringing all of these people together to get this reimbursement money made a few comment s that I thought were a little concerning , one of which I don't think we really can do anything about. He mentioned that in cities who have similar ly size population as Scranton , they have emergency management and emergency response teams. And they have 20 full-time people dedicated just to that for all of these different things that go on, floods and other disasters . Obviously right now we only have Mr. Jenkins who really that's not even his job according to him doing that. And we also have Mr. DeSarno who we made the Emergency Management Coordinator . Now, as I was sitting there tonight in the caucus and Mr. Jenkins was talking about emergency management in the City of Scranton , I did think back to last year. The administration granted the Fire Chief a $12,500 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 increase in salary and that was due to the fact that we were giving him another title of or another responsibility as Emergency Management Coordinator . I had asked several question s about this and what functions and what duties he would take on with this new position or this new title. Mr. Bulzoni responded last year that the Emergency Management Coordinator will do the following : He will conduct training assessments , develop a multiyear training plan, conduct relative training for designated personnel with emergency planning response or recovery responsibilities . He'll also be responsible for developing and facilitating pertinent plan document s and exercises related to relevant hazards and threats . Mrs. Reed, if you could please request from the Fire Chief or the administration any documents related to what those responsibilities entail and what has been done in that role as Emergency Management Coordinator . Again, I would like to see what kind of progress was made. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 There was a substantial increase granted in last year's budget and I think we should see what kind of bang we got for our buck there. Mrs. Dempsey mention ed the 2018 audit, where is it. We don't have it yet obviously as she mentioned . Mr. Bulzoni gave a response that he's looking for it on December 1st at least a draft by December 1st. He does not expect it sooner. The audit company indicated they may need to restate a component of the 2017 audit. But he does not have addition al detail. That begs many other question s. What is that 2017 component ? Why does it need to be restated? What is the issue why we're not getting the audit on time why we have to wait until December 1st? As Councilwoman Dempsey and Councilman Donahue had mentioned , it's difficult to make a decision on a budget when you don't have the audit from the previous year for a number of different reasons . So I would think that one of the things we should probably do is -- and I felt this for quite a few years, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 request an exit conference with the audit company so that I think they have a conference with the administration . I think we should have one with the audit company in a public caucus, number one. And number two, let's just get in touch with the auditing firm and find out from them what the story is here and why this is taking so long. So maybe we want to put something in writing and draft something on that end. Mrs. Schumacher asked about Police Department overtime . Again, I'm waiting on a report from Chief Graziano . That number sometime s is misleading because again, you have to see what is reimbursed from other entities who have used our Police Department for various things. I had a -- went out and met with a woman who lives on Schimpf Court behind Kelly's Pub and Eatery, several concerns out there. We did send this to the DPW. I would like to see in the next round of paving if we can getting Schimpf Court paved. I know it might be frowned upon to look to pave courts and not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 other major streets throughout the City, but there are several families who live on Schimpf Court. And this court has not been paved in decades . So several people do live here. They have an awful hard time getting out, especially during the winter. Also Breck Street off of Cedar Avenue should also be placed on a potential paving list. And in the interim there are clumps of debris in Schimpf Court from runoff that needs to be removed and we did send that to the DPW. Also, there was a resident who reached out to me about the Bloom Avenue bridge in North Scranton falling apart and issues there. We are waiting for an update from the City Engineer on that project . Council woman Dempsey mentioned the Ethics Code signing , I couldn't agree with her anymore . I think that -- I don't know where the confusion lies for a few reasons . Number one, we passed the Ethics Code I think back in January of this year. So there's been more than enough time for people to read it. Number two, it should be on the department head to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 make sure that all the employees in the department read the code, understand it, sign it and the training should be held. If there is any, you know, confusion about whether a bargaining agreement conflicts with the Ethics Code, as Council woman Dempsey pointed out within the last few weeks there's a clause in there that we specifical ly put in last year that states if the code conflict s with the bargaining agreement , the bargaining agreement will supersede it. I believe it was the police union who their union representative had sent Council a letter which our solicitor reviewed a year ago with concerns about the Ethics Code. And we addressed them before final passage . So again, I just think that we need to get going on this and then training s can be held. I also want to thank Director Gallagher for coming to our caucus tonight and answering some unanswered question s about the gas card situation . Contrary to what Mr. Bolus said, I do think this is still important . Remember , these are taxpayer dollars . So, you know, you can't just look the other way. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 We have a responsibility and an obligation as Council members and as an oversight branch to look at these things and to make sure that they are being done the right way which is why we'll be voting on an audit tonight . So I just want to say I do appreciate him coming and giving us some more information . In regards to one of the questions that came up about the large amount of gas that was purchased on two different days in January , 2018 and 2019, he did provide receipts for both of those days that showed that there were garbage trucks that had to be filled. So I appreciate that. The nonfuel purchase that was in question of 2548 on January 22nd, 2018, Mr. Gallagher did not have a receipt for that. But again, I do appreciate it. And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just a couple quick comments . Obviously we'll be introducing the budget tonight . I don't have a whole lot to say on it just because it is such a large document and I don't think any of us had a chance to fully analyze it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 But one item that has come up from the podium and I know a lot of resident s have been talking about is about the change in the garbage fee. Just to add a little bit further clarification , I know Councilman Donahue touched on this as well. It does eliminate the $300 per unit garbage fee. And it rolls it into the taxes as a $250 fee that's paid per parcel or per building or on vacant land. Also the fee is now going to be paid on commercial buildings that previously have not paid the fee. In my conversations with Mayor Evans, one of the thoughts was to work on -- and we saw it this past weekend the need for electronic s recycling to be offered not only residences but also to those commercial properties as well that will now be paying the fee. On the whole, I'm very supportive of the change. It is a step in the right direction . And the biggest reason for the decrease is because our garbage collection rates were bismal. I know we talked about numerous times at these meetings about people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 who owe hundreds of thousands of dollars in back garbage fees and other than putting a lien on the property really nothing can be done. Now, if the garbage fees are not paid as part of the taxes, the property goes to tax sale just as if you don't pay your taxes. So by increasing that collection rate from in the 60s to in the 90s, that allows the total rate to come down from $300 to $250. So one point in the budget that I'm fully support ive of, I think it's a step in the right direction . There are some other items that I do have concerns about some new positions , some salary increases , again, it's a very large budget. I have to look through it much closer. But I want to bring up those item two items. Licensing , Inspection and Permits came up again tonight . We're going to be voting on a piece of legislation to do a review in that department . That department does need a complete revamping . And I do agree with some of the items that were mention ed that it is too difficult to get a permit particularly for small business owners or somebody that owns a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 four-unit rental building is considered commercial under the City ordinance . I believe it comes from the state ordinance . But that's something that we can look into. Personally -- and I don't think there's much support for going as far as I would like to go, I would like to deregulate the entire department and make it a much easier process . Put in for a permit online, owner/occupant s can do any work they would like with the exception of safety components , electrical , things of that nature. That's what I would like to see happen. But hopefully with a review of that department that will be a step in the right direction . Finally , I wanted to bring this up in caucus but if my colleagues agree I would like to send a letter to the school district to ask where they stand regarding the payroll prep tax and a conversion from the Mercantile tax now that the referendum passed by such a wide margin. So if everyone 's in agreement with that, I'd like to send a letter to the school district . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 I am fully supportive of this change. But I do think it's important that it needs to be done in conjunction with the school district . If it's not, much of the benefit goes away of changing the system. I was very happy. I think we all were pleased with the result of that referendum that it passed by such a wide margin. I'll be honest. I was very surprised . Typically when there is a referendum and people see tax they tend to vote no even without knowing the full repercussions . So I'm very happy with how that turned out. And finally , I would like to congratulate all the winners of the election, Paige Cognetti , everyone who ran. It's very difficult to run for office so they all deserve to be commend ed. I also look forward to new colleague s on City Council come next year. That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Can I just make one statement ? I'm sorry, Mr. Rogan. I would be remiss if I didn't mention as Mayor Wayne Evans who came earlier tonight , Bob McGoff. And I almost forgot that it will be four years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 tomorrow since he's passed away. Mrs. Reed and I often think about some of things that he did when he was Council President on Council . And I was just a rookie Councilman coming in and he kind of took me under his wing. And he was such a great person. And when I think of somebody who had class, he really did have class. You can't teach that. You just have it. And he always did the right thing. And I just appreciate d it sitting next to him up here. Again, he was a great person. When he was going through his battle with cancer, he really fought it. I mean, I've never seen anyone fight like that in my entire life. And I think all of us who had the pleasure to work with him learned something from him both before he was sick and then when we was going through that. So again, his wife is such a great person. His children are great people. And we're all thinking of him today. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Couldn't agree more and since we're talking about it, what really hit the nail on the head on your comment s and when I first came on Council , Mr. McGoff and myself 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 were on opposite sides of the political aisle on many issues. But by the end of our time on Council together , not only have we become friends but we found compromise . There were many times when we would be completely opposite ends on an issue and a compromise would be reached . So unfortunately , in the political arena that we live in now that's something that's very rare. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY , 2020 TO AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2020 BY THE ADOPTION OF THE GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2020. MR. ROGAN: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , as my colleagues mentioned earlier we did just receive the budget on Friday. So I'm still as they all are in the process of reviewing it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 However , just looking at it briefly and not really going in depth, I do have several concerns . Last November during the budget season I imposed several questions to Mr. Bulzoni regarding the 2019 budget. And I stated at that time that I was concerned that we were -- or the City was underestimating expenditures and overstating revenues . And I'll give you one example . A question that I had posed to Mr. Bulzoni and the administration last year at the same time was the following: The City project ed healthcare insurance costs are based on 2018 year-to-date costs according to the budget narrative . I asked what are the healthcare costs for the City as of November 20th, 2018. If you assume that healthcare costs will increase three and a half percent for the 2019 budget year and you take the 2018 annualized health insurance cost of roughly 16 and a half million dollars , the projected 2019 health insurance cost would be roughly 17 million dollars . The City is actually project ing that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 health insurance costs will be 15 and a half million dollars . My concern is that healthcare cost may be understated by nearly one and a half million dollars . Can you please provide your rational e for the 2019 budgeted healthcare cost and budget worksheet calculations ? Mr. Bulzoni did provide that and then he did give an explanation that there were two claims subject to stop loss of $500,000, five claims approximating stop loss, four are expected to recur in 2019. Three are non recurring . He said several calculation s are from the low end of the perspective data range anticipated savings exceeding $500,000 from the Remedy Analytics Program are incorporated into the forecast. Draw your own conclusion s as warranted based on the above information . Mr. Bulzoni states in the 2020 budget narrative that he underbudgeted the healthcare costs last year. As Miss Hodowanitz had mention ed, the City will see an increase in healthcare costs from what was budgeted in 2019 to 72 percent according to my calculations . So at this time, it looks like we're going to be over budget in almost every category . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 So I'm going to have questions on that because I would like to know, first of all, what were the savings from this Remedy Analytics Program and how could we be that off with healthcare projections . And, you know, when I asked this last year, I don't want to say that I wasn't taken seriously but I felt like I was kind of dismissed , and it wasn't really taken seriously . But I did have a concern about that last year. This is another budget which unfortunately survives on one time revenue streams . In Mr. Bulzoni 's narrative it states that the budget uses one time variable revenue assignments through the sale of refuse receivable s and/or a refuse amnesty as well as occurring means through the introduction of the payroll preparation tax and the subsequent phasing out of the current year Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax collections . It also goes onto say that a refuse fee may be imbedded in a real estate tax bill beginning either in 2020 or 2021. I have a few concerns here. And most of it is about logistics . And I think having a public caucus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 with Mr. Bulzoni and the Mayor and the administration will hopefully quell some of these concerns . One, if it's not done until 2021, wouldn't that create a revenue shortfall? What would be the effect of not turning over the refuse fee into the real estate tax bills? So it seems like there's a variable here. It could either be done in 2020 or 2021. What does that process look like? What data do we have that points to this initiative broadening the collection universe and increasing the collection rate? Mr. Bulzoni also used the term in theory which does not instill, you know, the greatest confidence in me at least. And I know Councilman Donahue had brought up some concerns again about the logistic s. So I think we want to know how this whole thing's going to work out. I'm sure they put some thought into it. And I'd like to know or hopefully they put some thought into it and I'd like to know what that looks like. My other question is, you know, I did have a conversation with Mr. Bulzoni a few 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 weeks ago during kind of the preliminary phase when they released the preliminary budget. And at that time he explain ed to me that it looked like we were going to have a deficit anywhere between 1 and a half million to 2 million dollars . So if it weren't for, you know, this one time revenue stream and this sale of refuse receivable s, which again, I think we need to know way more about before we approve this budget and a refuse amnesty program which again, short on details; we probably would be looking at a tax increase . I would like to know what the tax increase would look like this year if that wasn't the option. And if this doesn't pan out, what is plan B -- what is their plan B? I know that they're not going -- they may not be here next year. There will be a new administration . But I do think it's incumbent upon them to explain that. And if it doesn't work out, what will the tax increase or deficit look like next year. Mr. Bulzoni stated in his budget summary that the Pennsylvania Economy League 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 and the Amoroso recovery plan recommended incremental tax increases over a number of years, which it did. What I'm concerned about quite honestly is not -- is the City not advocating a tax increase . What I'm advocating is just everybody -- and I'm not saying people aren't being honest. All I'm saying is if you don't raise taxes for a number of years in a row and then what I don't want to happen is next November , the November surprise comes and we're raising them double digit. And that is my fear. So I think we need to ask for further clarification on that and let's try to get a true picture of what's going on. Also, I think that it's crucial that we have a caucus with the Pennsylvania Economy League. As has been discussed here many times, we are exiting from Act 47 and technically we will be shedding the distressed label. My concern though is that even though we may be shedding the title of distress , we still will technically be distressed . Year after year if we don't have these one time revenue sources our expenditures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 are exceeding our revenue s. So again, I think we need to have a conversation with PEL about that. And I know that Mr. Cross from PEL was in touch with Mrs. Reed and they are going to issue as they do every year their letter to Council on the budget. Also, lowering the garbage fee from $300 to 250, I'd like to know what data was used to make the refuse revenue projections . What is the process and timeline for transferring that refuse bill into the real estate tax bill, have all of the potential pitfalls that Mr. Donahue has mentioned have these been thought out? Did the administration consider -- and I'm sure they did the current lawsuit regarding the trash fee when making this move. I think Council was told months ago that the City couldn't do really anything with the garbage fee or move it into the real estate tax bill because of the lawsuit . So what has changed in that regard and we probably need an update on the lawsuit . In regard to what Mrs. Schumacher had mentioned regarding the union contract s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 that were renegotiated in 2015 that were claiming to save millions of dollars over the life of the contracts , I went back and looked in the archives . And on March 20th, 2016, Mr. Bulzoni had mentioned that the administration had not conducted an analysis of the new contract s and a cost benefit analysis but would at the end of the year when a full fiscal year had passed. He said at that time that it would allow for a more accurate financial picture of savings and new revenue . I would like to know if this analysis has taken place yet, if so, I think Council deserve s a copy of it. And I do think that's important , especial ly moving forward . Also, I think we -- I think I asked this last year about the SAFER Grant for the fire department . That grant I believe expired in 2018. It was funding at least 14 firemen . I would like to ask if it's the administration 's plan to keep these firemen , I'm assuming it is since it's baked into the budget and how are they going to pay for them. Are they going to absorb the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 position s into the budget paying full cost? What does that look like? This was a concern . I know a few years ago it was in the newspaper back in 2016, the administration at that time had said their plan was possibly to lay off those positions until position s became available once the grant ran out. And in April of 2016, the City claimed that the hiring of these firemen would drastically reduce overtime . So again, I think we do need some confirmation on that. I requested a copy of the summary trial balance of all City accounts as of October 31st, 2019 and October 31st, 2018. I believe that we did receive those today. I haven't had a chance to look at them. I also ask what the account s payable amount was on January 1st, 2019 and what the account was -- accounts payable was as of November 15th, 2019. There are quite a few employees who have received raises in the budget. I would like if Mr. Bulzoni could just detail which employees , nonunion employees receive those raises, the amount of the raise and I believe he did provide a rational e on the budget 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 narrative . Also Mr. Bulzoni stated that the improvement in Mercantile and Business Privilege tax collection percentages through the use of analytics by the Single Tax Office was never fully realize d. So it begs the question why that was never fully realize d. I also think we need to have a caucus with the City Tax Collector on this and other issues. I had a chance to speak to Mr. Fox. And he agreed that that wouldn't be a terrible idea. So I do think we should make an effort before we pass the budget to get them in here to ask them question s about that. Also in the narrative it says that the Licensing and Inspections budget reflect s on optimism that tax abatement legislation will have a positive effect on development . I'm not sure I necessarily agree with this statement . To date as far as I know, we have only received five applications -- five applications have been pulled for the tax abatement legislation . So I would like to know what the rational e is behind that. The other thing that's mentioned in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 the budget that I have a problem with already is the optional salary components for addition s in the Mayor's office and the fire department . I don't think I have seen this done before in five years. And I think according to the narrative Mr. Bulzoni and the Mayor and his administration are putting in salary but they're not putting in the position . I guess they're leaving that up to the next Mayor. They want to put an addition in the Mayor's office, the fire department , DPW a second shift mechanic . It's just my belief that it either should be in the budget or not in the budget because I think, you know, Council has to vote on that and you're kind of circumventing the checks and balance s because who's to say that you can't take that other salary and create a position that's not mentioned here. I don't know that there's precedent for that. And I -- off the top of my head and off of having a cursory review of this I would have an issue with that. Also, other salary is funded for the possibility that the Single Tax Office is designated as collector of payroll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 prep tax. The office would be require d to have personnel for the collection of the tax. Again, way too arbitrary . We need more information on this. I don't think we should go into the 2020 budget not knowing how many people they might possibly need, what those costs might look like. So again, we need more information on that. I had asked Mr. Gallagher who came to our caucus tonight about the DPW fleet manager in the budget. They're calling it the DPW fleet coordinator . I'd like to know if this is a union or nonunion position . Another thing that came up in my quick look at the budget was firehouse improvement projects . We're still paying for finishing items. So I'd like to know what are they. What is the total cost of this project and did we go over budget? I could be wrong, but it seems like this project has been going on now for quite a few years. This had to be at least 2015 or 2016 but that was in the budget and it seems like we're still trying to finish it up. I'd also like to get an update on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 the Novembrino Project . And to piggyback on what Councilwoman Dempsey had mentioned earlier about the grants, I think as part of this process we should get an update on all project s in the City that are currently ongoing . For example , the Serrenti Center which I was against a few years ago seems to be a huge cost to our budget. So I'd like to know what the amount is on that project . Again, I would like to invite the Pennsylvania Economy League to a public caucus. I think it's important to make sure, especially in light of our potential exit from Act 47 that we are in line with our exit line projections . I do want to thank Mr. Bulzoni for his narratives . They are very helpful . And I do know that a lot of effort and a lot of time goes into preparing these budgets, presenting these budgets. So I do want to thank them for that. And I do look forward to Council compiling their questions or concerns , present ing them to the administration and then having the ability to have a conversation about it. I would say that I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 Mr. Hodowanitz had delivered question s to us tonight . Any question s that the public has about the budget since this is taxpayer dollars and this is your money, I personally would take those question s and I would hope that my colleagues would and we would incorporate that into the document that we're going to send the administration . So if you do have any question s in your review of the budget, if you could get them to Council so that we can include them in what we send to the administration . And those are my initial thoughts on the budget. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just real quick on the question .

I'm against this legislation just because of the fact that I don't think we need to govern modern building s by historical standards . I do believe the purpose of the HA RB is well-intentioned for historical buildings . But somebody building a new building or a building that's 5, 10, 20 years old within this zone should not have to face the delays and the added burden of going through the HARB to have exterior improvements on their property approved . Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Opposed ? No. The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 6-B.

MR. GAUGHAN : I make a motion to amend the term of the contract effective from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 August 1st, 2019 to July 31st, 2021 to effective from November 19th, 2019 to November 19th, 2020. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules I would recommend final passage of Item 7-E as amended . MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , given our current budgetary predicaments we're in I believe we should have kept this on the table, therefore , I'll be voting against this legislation . ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes, on the table as well. I will be voting for this legislation based on the investigation s I've done and the history knowledge I've obtained of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 Department of Licensing and Inspection . It has been plagued by deficiencies for years. I also know this is one of Mayor Evans' main initiatives . And I want to support that and I want to support the City moving forward . I also want to assist people like Mr. Bravo and Miss Dietrich who came here for the last two meetings to make this a more user-friendly bureau, something more progressive and something more forward thinking that could help this City move in and move forward . So I'll be voting for it. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I will also be voting for this for a number of reasons . First of all, since I have been on Council one of the chief complaints is the Licensing and Inspections Department , not putting blame on any one particular person. It's just the number of complaint s that we've gotten over the last five years is unbelievable , each one of us. So at some point you have to ask yourself what move you're going to make to correct those deficiencies and those errors and those complaints . I think the administration 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 plan is to bring a company in to take a look at each facet, each area of the department , work with the people who are employees in that department . There's a lot of good people that work in the Licensing and Inspections Department , work with whoever the new director of the department is. I think this will actually give the new administration coming in kind of a leg up on things, a fresh set of eyes to look over the department over the next year. One of the reasons I made the motion and everyone agreed with it is to amend the term of the contract because in talking with Isett and Associates , they probably don't need two years. One year is a better way to go about it. And I think that one of the things that has to be done in that department is to get a good department head. But we don't know what is going to happen. So we can't take any chances and hope that someone coming in is going to be a genius and fix everything . Why not get the extra help? Why not get someone who has great experience with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 Licensing and Inspections Department ? We got all of their references in, which I was impressed by from different cities and boroughs throughout the State of Pennsylvania . And is it perfect , no. But I think it's a step in the right direction and that's why I'll be voting for it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I would just like to add that I do believe this does need to be done in some form or another . I just think after reviewing the budget over the weekend I think we need to leave our options open to how we go about doing it. ATTY. DEMPSEY : And if I may very quickly only because I forgot to say this at first, I also asked this group for three sets of references for three different municipalities that they had done work for. And they provided us three written references from three different municipalities . And to me that is the best indicator of future work. That is another reason that I feel like this is the right company to go forward with. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: I would just like to add 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 I think my colleagues pretty much summed it up. There is a dire need for reform in the Licensing and Inspections Department . I see it firsthand every day for my work in real estate. Developers stonewalled, homeowners having delays. We've seen it particular ly at our Council meetings the last month or so, some resident s that are here today and I know there was an issue with a home that had a roof issue from the tornado that went through the Hill Section a few months back. And obviously this isn't going to solve those problems overnight . But I think if many of these issues are identified and a more streamlined process is put in place, this will help the City move that department in the right direction . I've said this a number of times outside of pothole s and road complaints , I get more calls about Licensing and Inspections than any other department . And it's just been atrocious . In order for this City to grow we need to make the City more business friendly. And we need to take some of this burden off of the contractor s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 and homeowner s. So I'm glad that this will pass. And I hope we see some results . Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : No. MS. CARRERA : Attorney Dempsey . ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-E legally and lawfully adopted . If there's no further business I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . ATTY. DEMPSEY : Motion to adjourn . MR. ROGAN: Meeting 's adjourned . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
