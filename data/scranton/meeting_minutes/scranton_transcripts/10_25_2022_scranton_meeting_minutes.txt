Pennsylvania Department of Transportation 40 is having a public meeting tomorrow at South Scranton Intermediate School from 6 to 8. And the purpose of the meeting -- the public meeting is to provide PennDOT staff and their design consultant s an opportunity to explain how the bridge project s that are slated to begin in a few years on Cedar Avenue over Roaring Brook and also outbound onto Pittston Avenue from the City that also go over Roaring Brook. And that meeting is tomorrow from 6 to 8 at South Scranton Intermediate School. If you are unable to attend the public meeting , there is an online public comment section that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 will be open from October 1st to November 30th. It could be accessed by visiting the PennDOT District Four website and by clicking on the public meeting s under district links selecting the tile for Lackawanna County and then selecting the tile for the projects listed. Also the Scranton Recreation Authority -- Municipal Recreation Authority is having a pet food and accessory drive on November 5th and 6th at the community room at Nay Aug from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. And they're looking for dog and cat food and/or supplies . Cash donation s or gift card donations from Amazon are also always welcome . And another reminder that there will be a kindness for Kelly McDowell fundraiser on November 5th at 5 p.m., on Montage Mountain . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Again, I didn't see anything in Third Order on the specific numbers for the DPW 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 contract . And since we have three more union contract s that are still being negotiated , we really should see what these contract s are costing us in terms of specific numbers . Speaking of which, do we have any update on the other union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding they are still under negotiation . MS. HODOWANITZ : And the 2021 audit? MR. DONAHUE : I know there's a meeting on that on Thursday . So I'm hoping to get an update after that meeting on Thursday . MS. HODOWANITZ : I was not pleased to hear during the caucus that we anticipated collecting 1.8 million dollars if I heard correctly in the Payroll Preparation Tax for the first three quarter s of this year. And so far we've collect ed what, $654,000. So we're running a little bit behind. Item 5-C, the transfer of $110,000 to LIPS, the Bureau of Buildings to pay the electric bills due to inflation . I'm not really surprised because everybody , government, business , private individuals are all seeing the affect of the inflation .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 But has anybody sat down and kind of looked at the budget and said, you know, this is what we're going to look at with inflation , all the utilities , all supplie s, everything else. Has anybody -- MR. DONAHUE : So those adjustments will be made moving forward . MS. HODOWANITZ : Do we have any idea how bad the paper cut is going to be? MR. DONAHUE : Not yet. But hopefully we do soon. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. One of the reasons I mention it is three weeks from today you're going to have the draft budget for next year. And, you know, it becomes difficult to have a realistic budget projection when you don't have solid numbers for the current year. But, hey, it's just monopoly money. MR. DONAHUE : We're looking to have the 2023 budget next week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, you are? MD. DONAHUE : We're anticipating to have it -- not on our agenda for next week. It will be on our agenda; but we will receive it by the end of next week for it to be on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 agenda for the following week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. That will be the week where you move the -- November 10th. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : All right. Item 5-I, the multi bridge project where the total cost increase d by a little over 10 million dollars from 30 to 40 million , why didn't the legislative cover sheet have a cost impact? Why did they leave that totally blank? MR. DONAHUE : I believe the cost impact is around a million dollars , but I will ask and clarify that. MS. HODOWANITZ : That should have been filled out. I shouldn 't have to go through dozens of pages trying to find that material . Item 3-D, Andrew Marichak is going to be the interim finance manager assistant BA through the end of the year. I assume he's replacing Rebecca McMullin who resigned earlier this month. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Does Mr. Marichak have any background in accounting and finance ? MR. DONAHUE : I believe he does, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Good. Good. That's a good choice. I didn't get to say this last week it was in the Third Order, but there was a summary of the income from licenses and permits through September which was over 3 million dollars and that exceeded what was budgeted for the entire year which only budgeted 2.6 million so good news for LIPS. That was well done. Now, here's a grievance I have. Last week a citizen wanted to come to this meeting . She was late. She got here at 7:00 and could not get into the building . Would you please ask the Mayor that if she's not going to open the building to normal traffic that she publicize how you get into this building , how you get appointments and everything else? It was unacceptable that a tax paying citizen could not come to this meeting and she tried to call me but my cell phone was turned off. MR. DONAHUE : And today was the first day I heard of that situation you're referring to. But I do believe that that door 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 automatically locks at 7:00. We're going to ask that they push that back a little farther moving forward . MS. HODOWANITZ : And whatever she decides to do, publicize it, you know? I mean, it's not enough for her employees to know what's going on. This City needs to know. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you. Next on the list, Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I just wanted to start off by saying that for the past four years I stood here at this podium and I talked about things that affected me as a returnee to the City of Scranton where I was raised. And I talked about the street signs because I was continuously getting lost. I talked about the intersection of Clay Avenue and Vine Street. I don't go that way anymore because I don't want to get broadsided, so I go a different way. So I'm not sure if that's been corrected . I've talked about the parking kiosks. I had to get used to using those and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 how to make sure -- I thought I had to pay from spot to spot in the City. I did learn that it is zoned so I could just put one fair into the meter and it does last as I go to place to place. So I also talked about the NDC and that 45 year bond. You know, to me that just blows my mind and I continue to read all the things that you have here. And when you think 45 year bond, I don't think -- well, we don't know when we're going to take our last breath. But, you know, our children are going to be left with that 45 year bond on the NDC because more than likely, we won't be here. So I talked about that over the years. But tonight I'm talking about something very personal to me. I hope I could get through it without becoming emotion al because even if I had not had other plans for last week, I don't think I could have spoke about it last week because it's something that is very dear to me. Over the years I spent a lot of time at the meeting s going on with the Nay Aug pool. I have been to the meeting s. I've heard the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 discussions . I've been a part of filling out the survey. So I thought I was quite versed in what was going on at the pool. When they were going to take down and dig up the pool -- and I only live a block away. So I was able to walk over and see them dig. They advertised in the paper there were article s in the paper when that was going to happen. So I was able to go and to see because I was informed . So as an informed resident of Scranton who goes to the park a lot because that's where I like to walk, I was just quite concerned when I heard the thumping going on. And the thumping turned out to be on that Monday a week ago they were tearing down the slides. I don't have to be aware of everything that goes on in the City. There's a lot that goes on. But one word that kept bothering me was my disappointment . My disappointment that we did not know. And I say we, I mean all the people in the park that walk. And we were not told or anything about it. It was not advertise d in the paper as far as I know. I get the paper 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 every morning . I go out and get it. I bring it back in. I sit down at my kitchen table with my coffee and enjoy the paper. Lots of times I just flip, flip, flip because there's nothing that I really care about. But I did not see anything . I was not aware. And like I said, I'm just Norma Jeffries plain old citizen of Scranton . So I don't have to know everything . But I feel that because I was involved in so many meetings and all, I was just hoping that I knew a little bit more and I was expecting it. So then that Tuesday , you know, as I walked and I see that huge, huge thing sitting there just grabbing and throwing it to the side, grabbing it and throwing it to the side and I thought there is so many kids that are going to miss that pool. I understand the money. I understand how much it cost to build it. That's not my issue is not the money. And having to replace a pool -- and I know it cost a lot. But to say that it was going to be replaced by a 3 foot pool and that the slide could not be accommodated , it's probably true. But I still go back to the word 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 transparency . We talk a lot about it. We hear about it. We hear the politicians and everyone talks about transparency . But I don't think we were advised about the pool. So I thought to myself as I was getting my emotions together that it says that Chris Doherty built the pool. I wasn't in Scranton then. And there was a lot of controversy from what I understand from what I read. So the records are going to show that Chris Doherty built the pool. But it's also going to show that the pool was demolished by this administration . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Miss Jeffries . Next on the list, Tim Swartz. MR. SWARTZ: I have a couple of things. First, I think Norma Jeffries is more than just a citizen in Scranton , she's an incredible person. But first, I want to say thank you to all of you. You've seen me up here many times about the zoning issue up near the hospital . I want to thank you for your willingness to listen to me and to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 resident s up there and to act as well. I'm really appreciative of that. That's just me Tim Swartz saying that. The residents can say that as well if they think that too. I'm grateful for that. And I know you have a very thankless job. I know it's a part-time-job or whatever you do. And I've met all of you outside of this chamber to talk about it. I'm really grateful for that commitment . Now that's on the record as I look at the camera there. Second thing, I came to ask for your help. We need your help. As you know, the school district has propose d a plan to start closing schools . John Adams Elementary is the first one on the list as is Sumner. Further down the list, the following year -- they will be closed this year. The following year they're going to close Prescott Elementary and send the kids to Green Ridge and other steps. I'm really concern about this and we need your help. First for John Adams, that school is an institution in that community . It provides stability . It provides security for the Pine Brook community . Without that school 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 I'm concerned for the community . There are families there at Adams -- I think that I heard that -- read that 86 percent of the student s live below the poverty line. The student s need a school in their community . I think about the revitalization plan. I think part of revitalization is the community is to add education into the community , add different tutoring program s, add whatever we can because the reality is in that community those kids are the ones that are going to be leading this City in the years to come. I'm really concerned about closing John Adams. It's a wonderful school. It's the most underresourced school in the most underresourced part of the City. If we close that school down, if the school does close down, I'm very concerned for Pine Brook. I'm also very concerned for the Hill and East Scranton . If this plan continues forward there will be no schools , no community schools which we know are valuable for Nay Aug Park to the other side of (inaudible .) There's going to be swath -- is that the right word -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 a huge hole in the City without neighbor hood schools . And I don't think that pays service to the Hill Neighborhood Association as I speak as the President of the Hill Neighborhood Association . So I'm asking for your help. I don't know what that help looks like. But I want to be sure it's on your plate for you to consider . If schools are closed in Pine Brook, definitely affecting that community . And in the Hill neighborhood where there's no more neighborhood schools in that community , that affects our city and that's why I'm bringing it to you. We need your help one way or the other to advocate for these communities , especially Pine Brook which is underresourced definitely . There's got to be a way that you could advocate with us for better solutions to the problems in the school district and better solutions for our neighborhood s that rely on neighborhood schools for our children and the many, many -- in John Adams the many, many families that could only walk their children to school every day. So I want to put that on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 your plate. Thank you for your time. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Tim. Next on the list, Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , taxpayer , homeowner . Well, it's been two weeks since I was last here and still no work on our corner. And I was promise d that would be fixed a year. So I don't know what the story is. Every time I come here, oh, you're on the list. I don't know what kind of list that is, but it's not working . Next thing, last Friday I was at the Steamtown Mall and leaving before the exit there was a mall security guard there with his car and lights flashing . I asked him what's going on because I seen like waterfall in front of me. He said they are doing concrete work upstairs . It's water from that. So I pull out and you get a shower of filthy water what's coming down from upstairs . I showed Kyle pictures before the meeting . My car was covered in what looked like muddy water. It was actually concrete water. And I wasn't the only one. It was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 many, many cars that was affected with that. First of all, it was stupid. They should have had that exit closed off and had everybody go out the Boscov's exit. But anyway, I went to the mall today to try to get to talk to somebody . You can't even get to the mall offices . You used to be able to go down the hallway on the second floor. Those doors are locked. I tried to go around to what used to be the food court. That section is roped off. You can't get to any offices to talk to somebody . I was looking for security guard, couldn't find any. I'm thinking to myself maybe I should try to steal something then maybe a guard would come around. But I got no satisfaction because I had to pay $10 to get my car washed. Thank God that stuff came off. That was water with some concrete mixed in it. I didn't think it was going to come off. So that's why I took picture s because I was ready to sue John Basalyga for a new paint job. But I think everybody that was affected by that should be reimbursed if they went to get their car washed. That's why I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 wanted to go talk to somebody . I mean, it's not a lot of money but it's the principle of the thing. It was stupid that they didn't shut that exit down. That's all on that. I don't know if I'll be here next week. So two weeks today is election day. I urge everybody to get out and vote. And if you want this country to move forward , do what I'm going to do just circle the little oval that says straight Democratic because the Republicans are trying to take our rights away from us. It's already been done in many states in this country where voting rights were limited for certain people, a women's right to choose what she wants to do with her body is being taken away from them. And another thing, if you vote Republicans in they don't want to do anything about gun legislation . Yesterday there was another shooting , a deadly shooting . It was on the news tonight again an AR-15 was used. I've been at this podium many times since -- those military weapons should not be for sale to anybody . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 They said the Democrats -- I think it was in Pennsylvania , maybe it wasn't. They have a bill to raise the age from 18 to 21. That's not going to help anything . If you have a mental health problem when you are 21 and you get your hands on these guns, it doesn't matter what age you are. They're still going to kill people. You got to get rid of these military style weapons . I'm all for the Second Amendment . People should be able to protect themselves , but you don't need an AR-15 to protect yourself . They're just military weapons . The police don't even have weapons like that. So anyway, like I said, the Republicans want to take all of our rights away. So on November 8th vote straight Democrat . And I'm going to leave here tonight and go watch the debate and see John Fetterman kick Dr. Oz's butt back to New Jersey where he belongs . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Council , if you don't mind I'll read this so I don't make any tragic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 mistakes . As many I read this bleeding heart absurdity in today's paper about mad taxpayers who have just had enough finally from this out of control runaway school system. They're told the last thing to consider here is to have any out of town teachers , no English speaking mommas dictate school policy. I like many, I've had my property over 25 years. I don't have any children , any grandchildren . Nobody's been in the school system. Think how much money I've spent in 25 years on this system. It's not a fair -- it's time you think about the taxpayers . And closing some schools is harsh but it's got to be done. We just can't keep raising our house taxes and trading people's homes for the expensive alternative of schools . Twenty-five years and I've talked to people that have had well over 25 years of expenses with no children or their children been out all that time. All the expense and money that I've spent, I have no voice in the school system. Nobody seems to care but some people, they're not paying taxes. They live 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 off the taxpayers . They seem to have more voice about what to do than do any taxpayers around here. All I know about our school system is what I'm told really. Just a few nights ago at Sheetz a teacher -- a former teacher told me she quit this year. Well, she quit last year. She wasn't going to teach this year. She said she's making about a third less and is much happier . She said that she had unvaccinated children in the classroom . They had no education . There was no way to try to teach them something because they just had no interest in learning . And they have a reluctance to speak Spanish because no one at home speaks -- I mean speak English . No one at home speaks English . It's just an endless circle. Of course, I don't know the solution to it. It's a terrible -- if you think these are the people that are going to be sitting there in 10 years or 20 years, it's a terrible thought . But to get back to our closing of schools , what alternative is there? You can't just have -- you just can't let teachers -- I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 don't know what you're suppose d to do. I really don't. But I know that a couple weeks ago I mentioned Mr. Peters that he was 75 years old and looking for a job to save his home because of these kinds of instances . And our taxes are going to go up and up, especially with Debbie and wanting the future reassessment . Jerry insists on it. It's going to cleanse the City of a lot of good people, minorities . It's coming. And you know who will replace them? Like across the street of me some slum landlord in New York. He bought a condemned house and doesn't even want to fix it up. You know, what are you going to do with these people? He'll move a family in there sooner or later. They'll find somebody that will take it like it is. All right. No controversy tonight . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yeah. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . Well, I guess the first thing I'll start with is, you know, I've been fielding a lot of texts 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 and calls from residents of the City wondering when City Hall is going to open and they're kind of curious why Council members haven't brought the Mayor into the chamber to ask what's actually going on. And they are under the impression that Council members are meeting with her on a one-on-one basis to sidestep Sunshine laws. Now, the other thing I have here is this Council needs to send a very strong signal about the school system in the City of Scranton . And they have to very firmly and quickly oppose any closures of any schools in the City of Scranton . This isn't make-believe . This is reality , okay. Now, some of you were on the School Board. You decided you weren't staying there. But somebody has to stop abandoning these children throughout this City and it's been going on for a long time. Now, there's an avenue of approach in regards to public school funding . But somebody would have to go into the Court. They might have to go to Commonwealth Court. The Constitution of Pennsylvania is very clear. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is responsible for the cost of education in this Commonwealth . And what they've done is, they've taken that cost and they saddled property owners with it. But the problem we have is we have a legislature that has no guts. They're all just political hacks, the same thing on the Senate and the same thing with the Governor . Don't forget that the Governor decided the people didn't have to pay rent during COVID. And then when it came time to pay everybody , the only people that could get paid were the people that actually had COVID so the landlord s all took it on the chin and took massive financial losses. What we have is a very incompetent government . And when you start listening to people of color who talk about what's wrong with this country , okay, because they are having discussion on that and at one time the black marriage rate was higher than any other group of people in this country , including Caucasians . Okay, and Johnson came through with his great plan where he was going to give 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 people money and destroy their whole society and their way of life by separating the man from the woman, okay. And when you look at the British studies about marriage and matrimony and destabilizing everything , look, the Democrats have been driving an agenda of destruction through this country for a long time. And people are talking about, you know, the Republicans are going to do something . There is more diversity in the Republican party now than ever. And it's my hope -- my wholehearted hope that the Republicans will begin to take control because the big problem this country has is a lack of employment opportunity . And the government should be protecting us. Look what happened to the slide at Nay Aug. They talked about it today. The Mayor wanted to take that down a long time ago. She also wants to take down the pool house. And the last thing I have here today is, you know, I had situation where I had to go to the building appeals board. And I'm really troubled that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Department of Licensing and Inspections is being used as a political tool to punish opponent s of the Mayor. Now, I overcame that. And it really doesn't bother me because I knew I had the right to go to the Court of Common Pleas if I had to. But, you know, that whole thing has to be restructur ed because how can the Board members sit and not ask questions of the people that are being brought there to answer for alleged violations under their codes, quality of life codes, all this make-believe . How can you pay for an appeal of $150 and not get your money back when the City had no merit to their argument ? How can the City come forward in a hearing without the person that wrote the ticket? And how can their solicitor determine what's admissible and silence the Board? That's something you should look at because it's a miscarriage of the whole judicial system. And when you look at the zoning laws, you know, I'm trying to get copies of some hearing s that took place. They don't want to give them to me, but they will. But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 just hope that we're all going to have fun. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn . Back when we had Governor Corbett we started getting denied supplemental subsidies to our school. Some say well in excess of 30 million and some say 40 million a year. And it's been at least 11 years. So we're already almost at a half of billion dollars that our schools have been denied. And I do think that walking from Prescott area down to Green Ridge for a six year old is like insanity. It's just total insanity. The state is trying to ram it down our throat. And that's all we seem to ever get out of the state here is more and more tax exempt property and excuses . That's all we seem to get. However , Corbett was not a Democrat . Sorry about that if you find it disturbing . And, okay, DPW, I would like to hear of at least a caucus with the workers of DPW because they had some pretty interesting points last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 week. And it's another thing where somebody is looking to shave maybe too much and at the wrong address . It would be -- really, trucks are made to be fixed and repaired and used for years and years and years. This is silly every five years we're buying all new trucks. They probably look like a rickety rack by the time they get done with them. And 13.50 an hour, I'd want 20 bucks an hour just to put up with the smell of a garbage truck. And then you could pay me 20 more to fix them. I don't have the certification s anymore but I have worked on them. We do have to look into public contracts before we go into any swimming pools or anything else. And I didn't care much for the -- being torn down. And I certainly hope the entry vestibule isn't torn down some day without us finding out about it. I am a fan of the Mayor but, you know, don't take everybody 's advice -- construction people because they just like to tear things down and put half as much up. That's what happened with that vestibule and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 entrance to the pool the last time under Mayor Doherty . We didn't even have a proper place to dress in there. Okay, our vote is coming up and there aren't any amendments like I mentioned before in Pennsylvania . The debate is tonight at 8 if you could get there. And I would like to note a few weeks ago the subject of internment camps came up. Well guess what, we did have internment camps. And children were separated from their parents . They still don't know some of the kids that were taken from their parents who they belong to. I don't know what they're going to do genetic tests or whatever . And by the way on the vote, our friends were in Pennsylvania , Mr. Flynn -- General Flynn. And they were blowing horns last night and screaming war. And I don't see why they should even fit into a 501C3. I think it's about time that some of these radical factions start to pay taxes and they start to pay property taxes and they start to pay income taxes. I'm tired of it, $84,000 a week for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 some hell and fire brimstone preacher . Well, he could afford to pay some taxes and help us support society . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts sign sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, as we've heard talk about briefly about was the slide. The slide when the City came in and destroyed this City asset without public notice reminded me of the saying of someone coming in like a thief in the night. They came under the cover of darkness and they destroyed a public asset that was paid for by the public without any public input. True, the public input was to fix the pool. Evidently the way they we fix things here is we destroy them. The real estate review by the county, looking at the recent news it looks like they expect a drop in value of all real estate to drop by approximately 20 percent over the next year or so because the market issues with housing and the economy . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 I wonder since it's -- they're evaluating new taxation basis off of valuation based on comps of property sales how that 20 percent reduction of value that's expected is ever going to get adjusted into that figure. Well, I know it's not going to because they are basing it purely off of last sales over the 18 months, not over a projected drop of 20 percent because a drop of 20 percent would harm grabbing more money from the taxpayers . Last week we had I believe a candidate that was in here who came to introduce themselves . I want to address that the candidate was asked by this body not once, not twice but three times whether he was a citizen -- a resident of Scranton , owned a business or a taxpayer here. This was done because Council Rules dictate that you must be a taxpayer or a resident to speak before City Council . I know City Council Rules because in coming to City Council , not only is it published on the back of the handouts, but anyone who is interested in law and politics should know the rules of the body before they actually enter and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 represent themselves before that body. I have an issue that three times he was asked before this body the question whether he lived here, had a business here or paid taxes here. And his response all three times was I have interests here. Having interest here is a non answer. And it's disturbing when a political candidate comes before a body that has rules and refuses to answer a direct question and avoids it by saying I have an interest here. Everyone has an interest in everything . That does not mean everyone has the full rights and authority to do everything that they want to. This body has rules. I believe it was out of order. And I just have an issue with that person coming before the body and avoiding direct questions like that because it points to the possibility if that person does take office of avoiding other direct questions straight down the line. As of access to this property , it's been spoken of I believe a week -- two weeks ago it was put forth by this body, give it a week's time for the Mayor to respond back on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 why that door needs to be closed. I have not heard whether or not it has been responded to yet. Historically , a building that has been open to the public is open to the public. This building would be classified as property that is open to the public for limited purposes . Historically it should be open. And since I'm running out of time, I wanted to note from this session as well that when the door downstairs closes before this meeting ends, it violates the Sunshine law because this building needs to open and accessible for the entire time that this meeting is going on. To not have it open violates that law. So this body needs to be able to control the doors, not having it done automatically on Council nights. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton City taxpayer . First I have a question , is the Scranton School District Board an elected position ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MR. GUZIEWICZ : Then it seems pretty clear to me that Scranton City taxpayers who pay property taxes do, in deed, have a say in the education matters . MR. DONAHUE : Yes, you are correct . MR. GUZIEWICZ : Thank you. I also do have a problem with the fact that school district s are sponsored by property tax though this is because the -- that means that school district s are directly funded by the wealth of the community . And this means that poor communities are guaranteed to have poorer education as wealthy communities and wealthy students are going to have a leg up with good education . That is, of course, pretty much a nationwide issue and not in your purview . But I think it needs to be said. I also have a question regarding why the Mayor does not come to City Council . I know that City Council is for City Council . But I'm used to Wilkes-Barre where the Mayor does show up to answer questions . Is that something that could be looked into or could be rectified ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. DONAHUE : Every once in a while the Mayor when invited does come for our caucuses that happen before our meeting . I know in two weeks she'll be here to present and give us an intro on the budget and then will also be back the following week to answer any followup questions on, you know, the budget as we move through that process . MR. GUZIEWICZ : Thank you. And, of course, you know my main reason being here is the train. Every day -- almost every day I come to Scranton on I-81. I drive here. And most of the time like anyone else who's ever been on 81 for more than 30 seconds , it's not a very positive experience . I don't think I've met anyone who likes 81. But credit where is due, October is the perfect month to drive on I-81. The weather is usually nice. But more importantly especially coming into Scranton past Moosic Street as you come down the mountain there before you hit the turn, the entire mountain opens up and has all these trees completely untouched and especially in the evening when the sun comes over the mountain , the entire 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 mountain side lights up in the golden hour and the reds, the yellows and browns really glow. You see this in Nay Aug Park also. The entire side of the mountain lights up. There may be a week left to experience that. A bunch of the trees are already dying. So I definitely recommend that everyone who has the means and the time take a trip out during the day, go up Moosic Road and get onto I-81 and drive back into Scranton and experience that. And then I ask that they take a moment to consider how much nicer it would be from a train because right down at the base of the mountain there where the two mountains meet, there is still the old Laurel Line. The track is still there being able to experience the natural beauty of Scranton , being able to really see why people decided to settle here in the first place all the way from ancient times to the colonial ancestor s and everyone beyond why this place is so beloved for so long, more than just the natural resources . It's beautiful . The City of Scranton and the surrounding area is gorgeous . And being able to really enjoy that without 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 having to worry about trucks merging in front of you, without having to worry about state trooper s hiding right around the turn, without having to worry about people weaving in and out of traffic or having issues with the road being wet or leafy while you're trying to slow down going downhill , just being able to sit back and relax and look out the window and enjoy the region is -- would be an unparalleled experience . October on the train coming into Scranton , leaving Scranton would be absolutely beautiful . And anyone who lives here deserves to be able to experience that. And right now people who don't drive can't and people who do drive have more important things to worry about while they're driving than the view from the car. But they should have that opportunity . I suggest that City Council and the City in general take that into consideration as we continue to discuss small commuter rail in the community . Lastly, I would like to issue a suggestion to City Council regarding the train. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 For the next week I would advise or maybe challenge City Council to not use a car to get to all of their daily activities without driving . Walk, bike if you can or take the bus; and I think you'll find within a couple of days that more investment in public transportation is absolutely mandatory for the community . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. So I'll start by some comments . The street sign update I asked about I'd say three weeks to a month ago if there is any update on renewing our work on the street signs whether we're going to apply for some grants, things like that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Can we reach out to the administration to see where we are at with the project and if we're going to continue on with trying to gain grants to continue on with the street signs? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get a status, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Spindler brought up tonight his corner. Can we reach out to the administration to ask if there's other projects similar to this and if they're working through that list of repairs that need to be made? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Another one, if we can reach out -- I know there was a change order that was approved for the removal of the slides. Can we find out when that change order was signed? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find that out, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Last week we did -- within the last few weeks we've been asking about City Hall and access to City Hall. And I know the Mayor came in to give us somewhat of an update. Can I ask for that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 update from one of our other members in Fifth Order here so we could hear what that update was? And the last thing, I'm going to make a motion if we can remove the frosted glass on this window right here? I know some of the other rooms have the glass but with the window being frosted here I don't have awareness of my surrounding s. And I don't feel safe. So I would like to make that motion. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor and a second. On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I arrived here one day and it was frosted -- so I arrived here one day and it was frosted . I was never involve d in thought -making process or the decision . So I was -- so I had a problem with that. And I also have a problem not seeing who is coming up the steps. I was used to seeing who was coming up the steps. If it's a safety issue, I'd rather have a mirrored window so I could see out and see what's coming up the steps. It's like frost on your windshield on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 your car. I just don't see the purpose of it for this room right here. So that's why I'm voting yes. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. KING: I agree. I don't like not being able to see out that hallway . Yet, everyone knows what's on the other side of that window. But we don't know what's on the other side of that window. So minimally , I think would be beneficial if we could actually see out. I don't care if it's back to clear glass or -- or if they put a solid door in there. But I'm not comfortable not being able to see out there. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I would say that I think I disagree because for me I don't mind it being there. I know our faces are forward anyway so we're not really seeing what is coming. It'd probably be more comfortable if people weren't able to see our positions . I don't think it would be a conversation if it was solid wood door.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 I certainly didn't put up the frost myself. But I would rather keep it just personally . And if we need to find out for like double-sided what cost that might be I'm fine with investigating that. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. KING: I would say this and I understand my colleague 's concerns . In my years as a school principal and superintendent , security was always a big concern of mine. And, in fact, the last position I held the desk in the office that I was in was facing -- my back was facing the front window of the entire school building . And the first thing I did before -- I never sat down at that desk. That desk was moved immediately to the side so that I could see my surrounding s. And I had awareness and I could see who was pulling up or who was walking down the sidewalk or who was immediately outside the school. To me, that's -- I think that's important . Right now we don't know who's outside there. We have a police officer in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 here which is great to protect us and to maintain order. But we don't know who is out in that hallway right now. But most people know that there is five souls sitting this side of that window. And I would say this -- I'll put this out to my colleague . I know that she doesn't feel safe, likes having that opaque. I'm willing to move myself down there to that end if we have a clear glass window and allow her to move down to this end if that's helpful because I just feel safer being able to see what's coming at that end. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : So I'd have to agree with that myself. I would offer to move my seat as well and I have in the past. Several times tonight the door in the back opened up and closed. And I didn't see someone come in. And if I could see through that window I would have known who was out there. For me it is awareness . I like to see what's coming and I don't think the glass offers safety. I'll be voting to remove it. MR. KING: And I will add also that if the option exists to have a solid door or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 come up with some other solution where we could see out and maybe people can't see in, I would be perfectly happy with that solution as well. MR. MCANDREW : In addition , Mr. King, I agree. There's five souls. There's actually more than five souls here. If I'm sitting here and I see something coming up, I would like to give the rest of the souls here a heads up and have that in my view. MR. KING: I just mean directly . You know, what I'm saying. MR. MCANDREW : I know. MR. SCHUSTER : In the past I've seen some, you know, contention out in the hallway and we know that it's coming in and at least being aware of it that something is occurring there that might be entering this room is a help to me. DR. ROTHCHILD : Well, I just want to add while I appreciate my colleagues offering to switch seats, I'm not just thinking about myself. I had in mind the safety of everyone up here, not just myself. So, yeah, I don't know that I have a change in opinion on it. I don't know that the schools for the classrooms 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 have just like open glass doors to go out of the classroom s. I'm not familiar with enough of the schools to know if they really have that but -- MR. MCANDREW : They have to. DR. ROTHCHILD : They're required to have glass doors, okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MR. DONAHUE : The ayes have it and so moved. MR. SCHUSTER : That is all. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I just had a few comments that I wanted to bring up tonight based on what some people spoke about during citizens participation . First off with regards to the pool, I know I didn't speak to this last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 week. But I know we were just as surprised as the public to have seen the pools being taken down. And I thought that we were being included in this process even though we had to ask for meeting s in the past for updates about the pool plan. But we certainly weren't aware of it and I would like to be. So I was disappointed with that. And I would like to know more about the plan moving forward before further actions are taken. And secondly , I just want to speak to the issues of the school closures that were brought up. We received a few e-mails about them. And I'd say I have a personal stake in it because we live a block away from Prescott and I was always really hopeful that my child would be able to go there once she is school aged. So it's disappoint ing to think that she might not be able to do that. And I was always really happy to have a -- to have a school that was a block away from our house. And I could always picture her, like, when she's older waiving to her as she's walking up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 the street. I even helped when they were opening the new playground in place there. So like I said, it's more -- it's a personal disappoint ment. I can't say that I have the answers for what the School Board should do or that I could tell them what to do in this case. But I do want to make sure that students who are underserved like in the community in Pine Brook with John Adams that they are given the resources that they need to receive the best possible education that they can. And I just had one more thing to add (speaking Spanish ) I don't understand what the problem is with people who speak Spanish or any other language for that matter and why people come up to City Council to attack those persons . That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : A couple. So after months of bringing up the pothole concerns on Pike Street, I'm happy to report that the potholes have been filled. And I was also 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 informed that Pike Street which has not been paved for 20 years will be on next year's paving schedule . So keep an eye on that one. And then also, Mr. Voldenberg , on September 20th I brought concern s that were brought to me about Walgreens on South Main Avenue in West Scranton that their maintenance personnel was just blowing trash and litter into the street. So I didn't see it on our report, but I was also contacted again today but not only are they blowing more rubbish into the road but also leaves. And that also present s a safety issue. You know how wet leaves are either walking or driving , so could you circle around and double-check to see where we are with that, both situations , the new one that present s itself and the last. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Also, I was also contact ed about someone not being able to get into the building last week at a meeting. I'm not talking during the day. That's next. And I agree with Miss Hodowanitz and President 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 Donahue that maybe, you know, because some of our caucus extend until 7:00 or past and with the upcoming budget season in process , we're going to have in-person meeting s with department heads. So our actual meeting will probably start actually past seven. So I think we need to pad the time a little bit at least for the near future and then figure out a set time and publicize it like it was mentioned . And then two weeks ago I made a motion to open City Hall back to the way it was preCOVID. All right, so I would like to take a moment to express my utter disbelief in the Mayor's decision to keep City Hall under lock and key behind closed doors. Within the last few months I've heard from irritated resident s that they would arrive at City Hall for a permit or visit a City department only to be told they need an appointment . They have been told to phone the office first and then someone has to come down to let them in. There have been several instances where the resident has called the office and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 nobody would answer. People are being treated as if them showing up at City Hall to conduct business is an inconvenience for some of the Mayor's employees . All of this has been done by the Mayor under the guise of safety. But safety for who and from what? Why is City Hall the only government building that is run this way? You could walk in the county building through metal detectors and then travel to every department with no issues. This is another example of lack of transparency from the Mayor. Just last week the beautiful slides were torn down at Nay Aug Park with no notice or no explanation . There has to be a better way. So after I made that motion and then in the spirit of transparency , Councilman Schuster and I asked for the Mayor to meet us at a Council meeting to explain the rational e for this continual stonewalling of the people of Scranton . She refused to meet in public. As I stated previously , City Hall is not the Mayor's personal residence . It is a historical landmark paid for by the taxpayer s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 of our City, therefore , they deserve access. I stand with the people of Scranton that want access to their government without appointments or roadblocks . Circle around with Nay Aug pools. So last week I mention ed my disgust with the Mayor's decision to tear down the slides at Nay Aug Park. Since then there has been a public outcry over the Mayor's decision . People from all over the City have reached out to express their disgust and confusion with this decision . It is the Mayor's plan to build a pool complex where the old one stood, then why should she take down the slides that were in perfectly good condition ? According to some members of the Recreation Authority Board, the slides recently passed state inspection and do not need any parts or repairs. And this was viewed on Jerry Smurl's Facebook post. It has also been reported by a former Parks and Rec director that the slides were refurbished under successful grant and not by the company that supplied them. This was less than 10 years ago. The metal portions were sanded down, treated and painted . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 The slides were also sanded to eliminate any grooves caused by use and then complete ly refinished and recoated. That cost over $40,000. The idea that the slides weren't maintained as the Mayor stated in the newspaper is complete rubbish . And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just to touch on a meeting myself and Councilman King had with the Mayor and Police Chief last week regarding access to the building , we were told that there is access to the building that you could come in through the first floor and go into what used to be the Treasury Department . Now it is Licensing and Inspections . And that if you were going to any other department that you could express that to the people at the counter and they would call that department and they would come down. That was the explanation we were given in terms of access. For the handicap ramp, you do have to call once, you know, you're getting -- just because it's in the back alley and we don't have a handicap ramp that goes into the front 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 of the building . That was the explanation . We got there and the Chief of Police, it was on his recommendation to put the door in and also to, you know, lock that down. I don't think it's going to be barrier per se but from his explanation is it would slow, you know, any potential attacker I guess you would say down. On the pool slides, I'm in agreement that I don't believe she should have been disregard ed the way they were. At the very least if they weren't going to be part of a plan they should have -- there might have been other uses for them instead of just tearing them down and throwing them away like trash. On the school closing s, I'm completely against , you know, closing s as they were present ed. I do agree with Mr. Swartz that, you know, it leaves a big void in the Hill Section neighborhood specifically . And also I think a part of West Side that has, you know, neighborhood schools, I believe strong neighborhood schools create strong communities and strong communities build strong cities. So I think we're, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 expressing that or I'm express ing that at least to different members of the School Board and administration . In terms of coming up with alternatives , I know myself and Mr. Schuster were at the public hearing or public comment session they had last evening . And I think we're going to continue to be active in that advocacy there. Also, Mr. Voldenberg , we got some -- I believe some letters regarding Portnoff and the trash bill. Could you follow up with the City Treasurer again through that with Portnoff regarding some of these issues that were brought up? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will tomorrow , sir. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And we also received a letter regarding setback requirements . Can you check with the zoning officer to see if there is any merit to these complaint s that were brought forward here? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And that's all I have for this evening . MR. KING: Can I just add quickly to the school situation ? As the former 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 superintendent of the Scranton School District , I understand that there are times when you have to consider , you know, closing old buildings . I believe that there truly needs to be an overall master plan rather than just closing and sending student s to existing buildings . When I was the superintendent of Scranton , we did have a plan where we closed John Marshall and Lincoln Jackson and Lincoln Jackson annex. But that was replaced with Isaac Tripp on 14 acres of land up in Tripp Park. We did tear down Whittier and we rebuilt a larger Whittier on that same footprint . We did not expect to have to close Audubon . But the mold in that school was beyond repair. It was unbelievable . I personally was in there with the mask on and I sneezed for three days after coming out of there. And after having professionals completely evaluate that building , sadly we did have to close Audubon . That was not an easy decision that we had to disperse students to really three different buildings . But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 believe that if they truly are looking at closing neighborhood schools , there needs to be a master plan greater than just sending them to other neighborhood schools . Perhaps if the goal is to, you know, maybe they need to look at some new elementary centers , I don't know. But I don't particularly care for the plan to close. Literally Adams will be gone. Prescott will be gone. Anyone that lives up in the Nay Aug area, the East Scranton area, in the Pine Brook area, there will be no schools on that entire section of the City of Scranton . And we do need to be extremely careful about who goes to those schools , you know, I mean, the students that attend those schools , there is 23 or 24 different languages spoken at John Adams. It's 85 percent free and reduced . Why was that school chosen? You know, how are those decisions made? I will tell you this. That's an old school. You're not going to go into a school that was better maintained and cleaner than John Adams Elementary School. It's one of the most well maintained schools that we've had in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 the City. So I just believe that they need to put the brakes on a little bit and really sit down and meet with the community and develop a master plan for where are we going with this, you know, 3, 5, 10, 20 years down the road. What's the goal? There is no doubt that the Scranton School District at one time had -- I think it was 48 schools in the City. And over time even when I started as superintendent , there were 18. And when I left there were 16. Ultimately we really need to see what is the overall goal, what's the vision, what's our population projections . Granted the numbers are down right now because student s, you know, the COVID situations some students have left and gone to cyber charter schools and things like that. But at the end of the day I just -- I think there can be a better plan rather than just rushing into -- that's low hanging fruit and it's attacking the poorest of the poor in the City. So I'm not in favor of the existing plan. I would rather see a master plan that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 involves more constituencies in those decisions . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : One last thing. Mr. Voldenberg , I'm going to change the subject back to City Hall. Can we get correspondence over to the Mayor and the Police Chief, have them put it in writing how they are going to address City Hall opening so I could have an official statement from her and the Police Chief of what the reasonings are, if there is any type of credible threat to the building . Thanks. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll secure that. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR.

DONAHUE : So you could ask that but I did ask that question yesterday . And based on, you know, the answer was, no, not foreseeable but still a possibility . MR. SCHUSTER : Basically not at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. On the question , so anytime there are -- budget transfers are allowed within a department . So I know they search for ways to pull this in from within the Licensing and Inspections Department to not have to touch our contingency fund. Unfortunately , that wasn't possible knowing how not only how big the electrical bills have gotten, not only current ly but then moving forward . So I believe that this will cover the electrical bill then for the rest of the year. So, you know, I know there might be a possibility based off of heat and natural gas costs in December . But at this time the answer to that question is no. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I'd just like to know how much more electric ity are they using than 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 any other department in the City? MR. DONAHUE : So Licensing and Inspection pays the electric bill for all electric ity used throughout the City. So the electric ity line item is under building s which is within Licensing and Inspection . So they pay the electric ity for DPW because it all comes in one bill. And it's just paid out of a line item that's in Licensing and Inspection . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye.

And one of those is building plans or infrastructure records that expose or create vulnerability to disclosure of the location , configuration , or security of critical systems and that includes fire suppression . And then it just goes on -- his response goes onto state that to the extent that a Right To Know request does not meet the exception , the records will be released upon request .
