KING: I would just like to announce that the Garden at Cedar conclude d their first year of operation s as a multifunction al community garden slash park. Recently just a week or so ago the Garden at Cedar hosted its first event where Santa distributed over 100 toys to neighborhood children down in the South Side area of Cedar Avenue. Does anyone else have any comments ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Least I forget, I wish everyone a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 happy and healthy holiday season and a wonderful new year. Would you, Mr. King, during Fifth Order just give the public the agenda for what's happening on December 21st, January 1st and January 2nd. I know it's going to come out in the legals down the road but so we have an idea of your various meetings and up through January 2nd. That would be useful for us. MR. KING: Sure. MS. HODOWANITZ : So what's going on with the 2022 audit? MR. KING: I could do that in Fifth Order unless you want me to do it now? Do you want me to do it now? MS. HODOWANITZ : You could do it during Fifth Order then. I hear that there's hope yet, you know, hope springs eternal . MR. KING: No, I'll say it real quickly . They are finalizing the audit. The BA's office is hoping to have the final audit for distribution later this week or early next week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Once it's distributed , can we request that IT put it on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 the website so that we could access it? MR. KING: We could certainly do that if you would, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MS. HODOWANITZ : And how are we doing on the firefighter and police union contracts ? MR. KING: Status quo as far as I know. They are still working on the language and -- MS. HODOWANITZ : One lesson learned is next time we put out contract for labor counsel we have some, you know, deadlines and caps on how much labor counsel is going to be paid. This really is ridiculous . The firefighter 's contract is now 254 days over due. It was supposed to be 120 days until, you know, we get it typed up. It's now 254. Police is now at 137 days. And I find it really irritating that the administration can't give us a projected delivery date. Can you say cash cow because I think that's what the city is becoming for these contracts . And it's not cash for the unions. And it's not cash for the citizens . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 It's not cash for the city. It's cash for the labor counsel . So this thing needs to get kicked in the butt. Okay, the Serrenti Center, we all saw the article in the paper about the lawsuit and the counter lawsuit with Scartelli Construction . My question basically is what is the status of the Serrenti Center and Novembrino Splash Pad? Are those properties ready for prime time or do they still need more work and more money? Do we know that? MR. KING: I'll have an update for you in Fifth Order on the Serrenti Center. I don't have an update for you on the splash pad. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, for next month we could look at the splash pad. MR. KING: Frank, if you could request an update on that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Those two properties should have been up and running long, long ago. With regard to the crime wave in Green Ridge, one question I had last week and I didn't get to voice it was, do we have neighborhood crime watches throughout the city and is there one in Green Ridge? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. KING: I don't believe so. I mean, maybe informally . But I don't know that we have formal crime watch groups out there. MS. HODOWANITZ : It may be something that the various neighborhood associations want to look at and see if there's a need. If so, how they could do it and maybe coordinate with the police department . I'm sure the police department would have valuable recommendations for what the neighborhood could do. But, you know, you see something , you say something . And with the new technology of these Ring doorbells and everything else that exists, I'm sure that the neighborhoods could help the police and the police could help the neighborhoods . It's an idea. And last but not least, I'm still keeping an eye on the status of tax relief for the victims of the September 9th flooding . I hear that, you know, the legislation is being prepared and we're working on it. But this something that should not drop. I remember my parents were strung along for five years before the property was taken off their hands. But they never got any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 tax relief. We've got families that have suffered significant financial loss and they've been out of their homes or their homes are being condemned . They deserve a break. These people have paid taxes year after year. It's time the city paid them back. MR. KING: Joan, I saw an e-mail this afternoon from the Mayor sent out to the three entities , the county and the school district requesting that the solicitors from all three entities get together and devise a plan quickly . MS. HODOWANITZ : I would hope so because those people deserve a good Christmas . Thank you. MR. KING: Agreed. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. King, in terms of that tax relief from -- Solicitor Gallagher wrote it up. I know we're kind of going back and forth about addresses . I was hoping to get it out before Christmas . Can we get that on the agenda for our first meeting back? MR. KING: I would hope so, yeah. MR. SCHUSTER : And in terms of, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 like, the county and the district , I think they are going to probably come along. But I would like us to move ahead and let them catch up to us. MR. KING: I don't disagree with that at all. Yeah, if we could get that legislation together and we all agree upon, you know, what properties qualify for getting tax relief. I would be more than interested in introducing it in early January . Thank you. Terry Gallagher . MR. GALLAGHER : Good evening . I'm here in my capacity as a board member for the Scranton Housing Authority . I've been there for many, many years. Several residents of West Scranton reached out to me recently indicating despite the significant damage from the flooding that no money had been provided by the City of Scranton to them, asked if there was some assistance that we could provide in that regard. As a result of that, I checked with the Scranton Housing Authority and there is some undesignated money that we received about a year ago as a result of a lawsuit against 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 HUD. It's not designated . It could be used for any specific purpose . We reached out to HUD. And they indicate d we could use that to help some of these individual s that were devastated in the flood. As a result of that, on December 4th I made a motion at the Housing Authority meeting that we provide those individual s that had a total loss or their homes were determined to be condemn ed by the city that we provide them a lump sum payment of $5,000 because at that time we didn't know if there was 1, 50, or 100. And we still don't know. And I'm going to request the Council to please provide us with some understanding of those homes that have been designated as condemned or a total loss. So I propose that $5,000 per household and Mary Ann Sinclair , another Westsider and myself voted for it. And then two recent members appoint ed by the Mayor voted against it so it fell. So there was money available from the government , HUD, that we had the ability to provide to the citizens , no strings attached , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 not going through the city, directly pay them and we couldn't get it done. Why, I have no idea. But I have every intention of doing it again. We went to the meeting this past Thursday in Keyser Valley and they've indicated as of that date as of Thursday , no money had been distribute d to the citizens . So I intend again at the next meeting at the Housing Authority on January 8th to propose again to provide money to these household s that have been condemned or total loss. What I would ask the Council to do is to give us a number if there is 10, 20, 30, whatever it is and I believe most of them occurred in West Scranton and North Scranton so then we could put out appropriate money because there is significant money at the Housing Authority that we could utilize for this specific purpose . MR. KING: Attorney Gallagher , you are looking for the list of the ones that were condemned . MR. GALLAGHER : Condemned or total loss. We thought that was one way to do it to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 determine that they would be specifically classified in such a way that we could give them money. Otherwise , if we say if you have a thousand dollars worth of damage then you are getting into cutting the baby in half, we don't know. But the condemned and total loss properties would be easy. And the city would determine that. So we're not saying we're trying to determine it ourselves. We're saying, City, you tell us which ones are total loss and condemn ed and we'll give you some money. Why people don't want money is beyond my comprehension . MR. KING: So, Mr. Gallagher , it was a 2-2 vote that it was -- MR. GALLAGHER : The third person was not there that evening . MR. KING: Okay. Had that person been there, do you think it would have gone through ? MR. GALLAGHER : I think it would have. I think anybody that has government money that we want to give to the citizen s of that government , why you wouldn't take it is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 beyond my comprehension . I'm not a smart guy but I don't understand that. MR. KING: I think you're pretty smart. MR. GALLAGHER : I don't know about that. But on January 8th, the next meeting I'm going to propose the same information. If I have the number of condemned and total loss properties , then maybe we could increase from 5,000 that we proposed to a large quantity of money. But we could get it to them quickly without -- MR. KING: I can't say definitely but I think the number is around 14. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, the original list that we had had 24 to 25. MR. GALLAGHER : Right. Then it was 10 and -- MR. SCHUSTER : So I think would be 25 probably at the max. MR. GALLAGHER : Okay. If I could get that list that would be helpful . And I'm going to propose the same thing. Hopefully the board will be full, the gentleman will be there and hopefully we could get it passed. I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 happy to answer any questions that anyone has relative to that. MR. MCANDREW : I don't have a question but a directive . Get the list, Mr. Voldenberg , please. MR. KING: I believe I might have the list in an e-mail that I could forward to -- MR. GALLAGHER : Great. If you forward it to the Housing Authority , great. We'll put it on. We'll have it on the next agenda. January 8th is our meeting . MR. SCHUSTER : One more question , the two individuals that voted that down, did they give any kind of reason for voting it down? MR. GALLAGHER : I don't know what their logic was. Obviously they must have had some. That they didn't express it. It was a vote no. MR. KING: It's a great gesture on your part. MR. GALLAGHER : It's not my money. You would never get any money from me, Bill. This is taxpayer 's money. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. KING: I think it was great idea, let me say that. And hopefully we could make that happen. MR. GALLAGHER : Great. I hope you can. You people have a lot of influence . Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thanks so much. MR. GALLAGHER : And Merry Christmas , good health to all of you. MR. KING: Same to you. All right. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . First of all, Attorney Gallagher , I want to congratulate you. Best of luck in your new position . I know you got big shoes to fill. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yes, I do. MR. SPINDLER : Moving on, recently I'm sure almost everybody 's heard about the college presidents that went in front of Congress and they failed to denounce the antisemitism at the universities . And University of Pennsylvania president recently resigned. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 And Harvard and MIT's presidents are under real pressure . So I hope they are also forced to resign. That brings me up to the Mayor. Mayor Cognetti still refuses to fly the flag of Israel. I think that is a big disrespect to the people of this city and Jews all over the internet . I think Mayor Cognetti should resign because she's disrespecting all the Jews in this area and not only here, all over the world. It's total disrespect not to fly that flag. And I think -- I hope everybody puts pressure on her. I was at a wonderful Hanukkah celebration at the JCC on Sunday. And I told everybody I could about it. So I hope they put a lot of pressure on her. And if she doesn't do this, I think she should resign because that's -- all the hate against Jews in the world now it's terrible . And she should show her support and she's not doing that. Moving on, yesterday I was coming home from somewhere and at the corner of Euclid and Main Avenue a pickup truck was coming off the Euclid and got T-boned by someone coming 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 over Main Avenue. I got there -- I just got there when the police car came around Main. I got there just as he got there. There was already a fire truck there. I don't think anybody was seriously hurt. But that's a bad area. And I came here years and years ago calling for a traffic light there. And they did a study and said it wasn't feasible because there's a light right after -- it was right where the railroad bridge is. There's a light right after the railroad bridge. But that doesn't help. I go -- I live right there. I go by there all the time. And it's terrible getting onto Main Avenue from Euclid and there have been many accident s there. Thank God I don't think any of them were serious . But, you know, the guy got T-boned yesterday . He could have been seriously hurt or killed. We definitely need a traffic light there. Some day it's going to be a tragedy . I know that is up to PennDOT . But it's not a city street, but I would send a letter to PennDOT . I know there -- that was one of many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 accidents that's there. I know Council man Schuster could probably attest to that how hard it is. He used to live in that area too. It's very difficult getting onto Main Avenue. Well, I think that's all I have tonight . I hope everybody has a Merry Christmas , Happy Hanukkah , Happy New Year. We'll see you next year. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . You too. Lenny Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council , sorry I'm a little horse tonight . I'm a happy camper tonight too. It's been a long time coming, but 10 years I've been coming here about the flooding problem in Keyser Valley with this Council and the former previous administration . So many neighbors have told me over the years that I'm wasting my time. But it's finally done. The 24 inch into the 18 inch, the 90 degree pipe is fixed in the Merrifield area. I don't know what's being done with the pump house. But I see workers in there frequently . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 I'm sure that this pipe being fixed is going to alleviate the flooding there. It's not going to cure the whole Keyser Valley. There is a lot more to be done. But the flood study is done. And the plan for the water runoff on West Mountain I understand starts in the spring of next year. It's going to be a big project . I heard somebody else say it won't get done yesterday , but hang in there people. My hat's off to Council and the Mayor. I know she gets a lots of criticism , but this time she did good. So did you guys. Thank you. I also want to thank the Director of DPW, Scott Pietreface and his supervisor , Steve Teamon. Other neighbors and I kept in contact explaining the process as they progressed repairing this pipe. Not only did they fix the 24 inch pipe, but they found multiple blockages all the way to Keyser Creek. They even found a raccoon family living in the pipe. I'm sure a lot more officials are involved including all them DPW workers , excuse me, but they were kicking ass to get the work 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 done. I believe I speak for myself and a lot of other neighbors there when I say thank you. I checked out the drainage now and the pipe at Keyser Creek and it was flowing . It looked good. I guess the real test will be the next big storm. Thanks. That's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Srebro. It's nice when we could make somebody happy for a change. So -- and kudos to our DPW and Scott Pietreface and Steve Teamon and the city and the Mayor's team. I'm thrilled that we're able to make that happen. And we look forward to the big stormwater project starting in Keyser Valley in the Spring. Jerry Dombroski . MR. DOMBROSKI : May I approach and give you these first? MR. KING: Absolutely . MR. DOMBROSKI : Gentlemen , Members of Council , I'm not a public speaker . So I hope you'll bear with me. You know a veteran is someone who at some time in their life wrote a blank check made payable to the United States of America for an amount up to and equal including their life. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I wrote that check May 20th, 1970. I think that shows I'm a reasonable person. I live at a property in Scranton for over 28 years. I put up with ATVs racing up and down the streets bordering my property the whole time. I put up the operation s of a commercial entity in a zoned residential area for about 28 years. The secret, a wife who died in my arms three years ago. She put up with me going to magistrate court being sued twice by a city worker who claimed I was harassing him by being a whistle blower about his activities while on the city payroll . I worked many years in a church in South Side for their festival s, even taking time off from my regular job to string a pickup truck load of lights and wires so that they could have their festival . I work with Habitat of Humanity . I think this also proves I'm a reasonable person. Now for the problem , I have repeatedly contact ed the city government by Scranton 311 to get help because I want a higher authority rather than leaving a message 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 with zoning because they don't answer the phone. The fact is there is a City Code that I could cite about this. According to the City of Scranton , the code, part two, general legislature zoning Article 5 Environmental Protection , paragraph 455-46, light and glare control , Section D shielding . All light sources including signs shall be shielded around the light source and carefully directed and placed to prevent the lighting from creating a nuisance to reasonable persons of adjacent buildings . It goes on, but that is not relevant to this. Like I said, I think I'm a reasonable person. I have numerous e-mails available upon request to Scranton 311 that show the pictures , the excessive light bombarding my property invading my kitchen and by a stadium type LED fixture . I demand that zoning act on this and condemn the property for the use of this fixture . The fixture should be removed and more appropriate less powerful lighting installed in its place. If the lighting is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 necessary to see the back of the yard of the property which the owner has also claimed a city alley or court to be part of his property . So, gentlemen , that's about all I have to say. Do you have any questions ? MR. KING: I do, Mr. Dombroski . So what is the address of where you live and the address of where the individual -- MR. DOMBROSKI : You know, I should have came prepared . MR. KING: That's all right. MR. DOMBROSKI : Mine is 1320 Froude Avenue. MR. KING: 1320 Froude. MR. DOMBROSKI : Yes. And the address of the other one is 1240 Brook, I think. They are a young couple. I'm going off of the record on this. They are a young couple but, you know, apparently 311 the zoning contacted them and just for spite he left it on all day and for spite. He was out there playing with his larger German Shepard in the yard until like way after dark. And I think it was just to spite because I had this complaint and the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 contacted them about it. Now you know the lights out in front of building here, they're about that quality and you could see by the picture s. I tried to take a picture of what's inside my kitchen -- blasting inside my kitchen . But, darn it, when you try taking it and the flash just doesn't want to cooperate and the flash goes off and you can't see it. Sorry about that. I didn't have that included . MR. KING: Are you near the intersection of Froude and Brook? I live probably seven blocks from there. MR. DOMBROSKI : I am on the corner of Froude and Cherry, yellow house, blue roof. And around the corner -- I can't remember who used to live there. But the fellow died and the house went up for sale. They bought it. On the corner of Froude and Brook is Knoll, Mrs. Knoll. Mr. Knoll died I think was last summer, no, the summer before. When he died I was cutting their grass just to be on the nice side to the Knolls. But that's next to the Knolls. It's a small house. I would like something done about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 this, not to -- I mean, it's ridiculous . This is a stadium light, something that should not be in a residential area. MR. SMURL: Mr. Dombroski , you notified me of this on Saturday . I sent it in Monday morning . I was notified back from the city that the zoning officer contacted them and told them to shade the light or whatever they told them and also that they were -- if they did not do it that they would go up and speak with them. MR. DOMBROSKI : All right. Thank you. But the thing is, I'm complaining . Next door to me they maybe the next to complain because it's shining in their bedroom windows . But thank you for your time. And I appreciate -- oh, as a comment , it's been a long time since I came before City Council . And at that time nobody would mention or ask questions or whatever . Gentlemen , my hats off to you. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dombroski . And we will look into this for you. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, thank you, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Council . Again, the Arc of Northeastern Pennsylvania has raked the city of taxes, two houses $825,000. When is the allowance by the city and the school board going to stop this constant acquisition s of property ? I never seen nothing like it. It's hard to pick up and read the sale of property . Almost daily there's some phoney nonprofit hiding behind the Pure Charity Act is struck. Why don't -- why doesn't the Arc buy property up in the Abingtons ? That's where the profit goes from all these houses. And whoever heard -- it was in the paper a year or two ago they have two, three, four people watching two or three people in a car. They just absolutely have destroyed our tax base like the developers downtown . They're always crying about something . I read you people are trying to make a local hero out of Basalyga . He's just a crybaby. He's got his taxes cut almost in half and now he wants more another $500,000 off. He's no hero. The people paying taxes are the heros in this town. Last week I saw the paper in notes here about building a lap pool with the two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 swimming pools. You people know what a lap pool is? It's addition expense . It's a tank about as long as your desk up there and about that deep. And it has a powerful wave of water and you swim against . Now, how many people you think need something like that making the city pay for it? This is another asinine expense . It's ridiculous . I don't mean to be a braggart about this, but in the 60s a dame that I was friendly with in Los Angeles wanted me to go to Vietnam and build swimming pools, Saudi Arabia and Israel and Lebanon . So I have a little knowledge about pools. And I don't see anything wrong in wanting two pools. I think it's a waste of money. But a lap pool would benefit just a couple people in this whole city that would be paying for it. And while I'm talking about the swimming pools, Mr. Smurl, I've had four or five, six people wanting to know who dismantled our $250,000 slide. Was it someone from the city or a scrap people and where was it scrapped and how much did they bring and who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 got the final check? You should have that information with you. I don't mean to demean you or embarrass you. I just -- that comes up. MR. SMURL: I don't know why would I have information . I was not on the Recreation Authority when it happened , nor was I in the City of Scranton when it happened . I was out of town. MR. ELLMAN: Well, I have a -- I would have looked it up. But just in conversation about the swimming pool and all, people have mentioned that several times. I don't see why it can't be published or put in the paper. This paper just refuses like they fear of the city knowing what's said in here by the taxpayers . Two, three times a week when I talk to someone , they ask things that happened in here. It should be in the paper. It's more interesting what people are saying than all the information that is in there about the meetings . And I wish everybody a very good holiday . MR. KING: You too, Mr. Ellman.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. ELLMAN: I hope it's a better year next year than this one. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. That exhausts the list. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all to, Mr. Gallagher , I hope your new position gives you happiness not only by preponderance of the evidence but may it be beyond a reasonable doubt. We have had conversations in here for about a year where we have been repeatedly told to contact 311. This is the magical number with fairy dust put out by the city to resolve all issues because of the locked door where citizens can't come in. Don't address your grievance in person, address your grievance to an answering machine if you could get that answering machine if it's not full. We've had multiple people stand before this body and say they've tried it, five, six, seven times and they get no answer back. Maybe it's time that we call Scranton 311 what it is. It's Scranton no one one. You call up to get no response , to get no call back 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 and to get nothing resolved until you actually come in and complain to people. And that's a sad state for something that's tauted as open, clearness and the way to contact and resolve your issues with the government because they don't want you in the people's building . Mr. King, you pointed out earlier that other -- on the tax relief other solicitors are working and other people are working on this that you hope things will move forward . You talk of hope for tax relief. Well, in this case, hope springs infernal not eternal , infernal . We have people who have been suffering . We've been promised this body would bring it forth. But repeatedly you kick it back to other solicitors , other organizations , the school board. And it's been now five or six weeks since you first asked your solicitor whose last night is here to bring paperwork defining what this body wanted because obviously this body could not define for the solicitor the terms that it wanted. It needed him to run the clock out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 so that the next solicitor can think about how those documents are because unfortunately , he will not be here to field those concerns . September 9th was a long way away. Relief should not take this long. And decisions on this body for the health, safety, and welfare for the community should not be pushed off to other departments . There is an ownership in this that needs to be taken by this body with prudent haste. And I think in the season of love and caring, it's a cruelty to leave them over this holiday seasons with their hands in their pockets saying we'll look at you next year. You've suffered , but we're going to sit up here and think about it. MR. KING: Mr. Coyne, I believe the tax relief is going to happen in 2024. It's not going backwards. So we plan on pushing this forward . That was mentioned earlier . MR. COYNE: I understand that. It shouldn 't take this long. They shouldn 't have to suffer and have this over their head for so long to have a resolution done. They shouldn 't get lip service when it's been months. There 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 should have been action. And that's what I call for is that we should have already been across that border. And they should have already had the relief knowing they are going to get relief before the recess, before the holiday , before tax season. MR. KING: I can't guarantee you the other two entities , but I could guarantee you the City of Scranton , they're going to be getting tax relief. MR. COYNE: I don't care about the City of Scranton . What about this body? What is this body going to do? MR. KING: I just told you what we're going to do. MR. COYNE: I'll wait to see it on paper. MR. KING: Okay. MR. COYNE: Recycling cards, have we heard about them because I have not receive d any recycling cards yet for the trash pickups. Are they lost again being mailed out of the city? MR. KING: Frank, can you check to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 see if they're available again -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: -- to DPW? Thank you. MR. COYNE: I'm out of time. But IT and two factor authentication is not fully the way. There are better ways. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard. MR. HOGAN: God bless you guys. My name is James Hogan. I'm not here to yell at you. Again, I'm here to tell you that I thank you guys for what you do. I like to -- this is my third time out here. I like to come out here to thank you and just to spread awareness , not just to you guys but to people that watch this on the TV. It's been very helpful in what we're trying to do. Even as of recent, like a city worker had watched this and then they were a big part of helping us do something that we have been trying to do for a couple years. So it's very important that I come out here and try to be as humble as I possibly can. I'm a nobody. We have a lot of good people around 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 us. We're just trying to help spread love in this area. I know that might bother someone or it might, you know, you might look at that in a different way. But we really believe that it's happening . So that being said, I want you guys to understand and everybody in the city to understand that when I say that I help homeless people and we as a group help homeless people, I promise you we do whatever we can to not enable them. And I think it's important for people to know that. And an example of that would be like I work with Owen down at the Heritage Trail. I'm sorry, I can't pronounce his last name, but he had talked to you guys at the city about a dumpster recently . We now have a couple dumpsters set up in the area where the homeless live. Yeah, we're going to go fill them up. We're going to put all the garbage in it, especial ly around the Heritage Trail. We want to do that. You think I'm going to do it without homeless people? Not a chance. The homeless people are coming with us to clean it up. Now, it may not be the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 homeless people that made the garbage but this is a process . And they are going to get on the other homeless people when they see them, you know? So it's very important that the people understand , like, we're trying to spread love to these people and not enable them. We thank you. Last time I was up here I asked just for a little bit of help to be able to pass out some hot chocolate and spread some soup out there. And we were able to do it. And I really, really truly appreciate whoever played a part in helping us get that. You know, like I said, a city worker was a part in it. Joseph Harmer, an inspector for the city came down to a big event and thank you for letting us down there where we were to go right into where the homeless live in the cold weather and just dump love and tons of clothes and food to them. And for you guys to allow us to do that, it means a lot to me, man. It really, really does, man. So I was told straight up, ain't no one going to bother you tonight . And that's just awesome . I can't say the same for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 that all the time. But I'm not here to cause any problems . I don't want to get anybody , you know, in trouble . However , this is a passion of mine. And I do advocate for these people. And I have relationships with these people all throughout the woods and all in the area. And I don't say that to brag. This is just to get people to understand . That being said, I know which ones I can trust. I know which ones I can't trust. I know which ones I might need a couple more witnesses for this one, right, but when certain people talk to me and they tell me a story and they look me in the face I already know if it happened or not. All right. And when it happens with the same cop calling them scumbags , showing up at their tents calling them scumbags, that hurts, man. That's not right. It shouldn 't happen, man. It shouldn 't happen. So we're inside the woods and we're offering the city to clean up the whole area, all right. There's so many reasons why these people are homeless , okay? Don't go into the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 woods and be sneaky about it and get up in these women's faces and call them scumbags . Man. I'm sorry, but I'm here to expose that. I have to. Officer Petrucci , I've heard your name many, many, many times on doing this. I have proof of it. I have video of it. I have audio of it. I have many, many homeless people that you hurt and scared and made suicidal . Please, I'm begging someone to step in and stop any officer -- as we're trying to go through and work with the city and spread love and pick up all the garbage -- you know, the last time we did this was last Saturday . The women that he did this to are a married couple. They live in a tent underneath the Lackawanna Avenue bridge. All right. He got up in their face. He called them scumbags . He told them if he comes back again, their tent wasn't going to be there anymore and he was going to put them in jail. Okay. At the same time -- MR. KING: Thank you. I appreciate that. Your time is up. I'm sorry. MR. HOGAN: Oh, was I up? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MR. KING: Yeah. MR. HOGAN: Sorry about that. MR. KING: Thank you. I appreciate you making us aware of the situation . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn . I'd just like to mention that when Obama took office in 2008, three out of five homeless people were veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan probably . So I would just like to mention that. So who are you calling a scumbag ? It's a shame. Okay, getting onto city business , East Mountain fire station , it's to me, I don't see any good reason to move that. It's easier to slide down the hill in a snowstorm than it is to get back up. You know, I think that's a fairly good place for that. I don't think we need a $100,000 study. And I think we just need to improve it and give it what it needs. That's what I'm all about with management. Give it what it needs. And also, with this flood business , you know, it wouldn't hurt for us to give fire relief, not forever but for six months, a year on property taxes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 And the county and the school board could always help out there a little bit. You know, they might even be living in another town while their house is reconstructed or decision is made to tear it down. On flags, I think we should just have the government flags out front. I don't care much for either side in the Middle East. That's just the way I feel. You know, if the Mayor wants to resign over that not -- only if Netanyahu resigns because it's part of it. Water hearing s, we should have hearing s local and formal complaint s should be -- I appreciate your participation in that and advocating for it because that water bill is an atrocity . And that's all there is to it. It is a pure atrocity . They are digging every week on our streets , every week. They started in the early spring and they're still digging . Now, last week I had another idea pop into my head here. Everybody is here complaining about property taxes. And, yeah, they are high for what we own. And, you know, a house only has one value until you sell it and that's a place 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 to live. So, I mean, if I sold my house I just had an offer today. But where would I live? Go out and spend three times as much, go move to a neighborhood that, you know, with a bunch of Republicans in it or something . Give me a break. I never liked up valley bands. I played guitar and I never liked those valley bands because everything , southern rock, southern rock, you know, forget the Beatles or the Stones or anything else that's a little more fun for me to play. But anyway, wages, now what would profit from higher wages other than 7.25 an hour? First of all, they'd be paying way more in city wage taxes. Social Security trust fund would increase from higher wages. And on top of it, the city and the school would get higher taxes coming in from wages and that would make it possible that maybe not this year or next year, but we wouldn't have to have these constant increase s of 3 percent , 5 percent . And then some years we went 25 and 30 percent or 50 percent or whatever . And that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 is why they're so high in the first place. And I think it would be an excellent idea. And it would only be nonbinding if you people and the Mayor would get together and just say no more tax exempts , please. Go somewhere else. That's all I have to say on that. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Please go somewhere else, 37 and a half percent . Crazy. Enough. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . I wasn't going to come to the podium tonight . But just to come to say Merry Christmas or Happy Hanukkah or whatever and wish for a good new year. But then I heard other people talking and it's true. It's very frustrating that you have to -- you can't come into your building . You cannot get a person on the phone with the exception of the City Council . They answer their phone. They talk to you. Business Administration frequently will also answer their phones. But it just is terrible that we can't reach the people either physically or through technology . And then also we had rain and we had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 snow. And we have American Water up on Snook Street. And they are spending a lot of money. I can't understand that people can't see what they're spending if they lived on East Mountain I think they would know that they're spending a lot of money up on East Mountain . But also, I have brought forth that water that comes down from one source for -- comes down, it goes down Seymour Avenue, goes down 307. It freezes and DPW is not going to come up every day with salt I guarantee you that. I don't blame them. But when you have -- if you could explain to me why you have a single pipe that is getting the water on and putting the water onto Snook Street. Fifteen to 20 feet up above there is a drain. I believe it's a drain. It's got a -- yeah, there's a drain. And I don't know why -- I would go out and buy it if I was allowed to do it, the piping and put it on the end that's bringing it out and take it up the road a little bit and put it into a drain. Did DPW really try that? Did they look at that? MR. KING: I don't know, Mrs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 Schumacher . I know it is difficult to redirect water back up hill to a drain. But I think that we asked Frank to contact DPW to ask them to look for some type of solution to get us through the winter. MR. VOLDENBERG : They're looking into it. I'll follow up with them tomorrow . MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : It's not, you know, it's not a 90 degree angle. And it comes out of that pipe I would say pretty strong -- at least strong enough to go that little bit because there's going to be an accident . I guarantee you that and it just needs to be fixed. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : Enjoy the rest of the year. MR. KING: Have a great holiday . MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. LITTLE: Hi Council . I'm Rick Little from Scranton . And I was reading the newspaper and I saw this headline, a long closer look at elder abuse which truly sparked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 my interest . State agent chief sees new center as a key by this guy Jeff. And I'd like to talk to Jeff, you know, because when I read articles I like to know where the information comes from. I've done a lot of research on homelessness and how things work. And I discovered that -- that Scranton Housing Authority is being run like a private hotel over the years. I found documentation as far back as 1967 where they call it Scranton Housing Authority housing for the elderly and there was an interest in that. But I've lived there for 15 years. And, you know, it went from, you know, they burst into my room if you don't like it, why don't you move? And then I realize I can't move. There's no way I could move because they're diabolically connected . They are connected to, number one, Lackawanna County, number two -- which includes all the courts, especially the magistrate court and the police department , the fire department , all the legal agencies that are supposed to protect . And I don't want to -- I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 wondering , there was a legislation made that any renter has to have a license here in Scranton and as of September this year. Do you know if that is being enforced , by who, by anybody ? MR. KING: Code enforcement . MR. LITTLE: Pardon me? MR. KING: Code enforce ment. MR. LITTLE: Code enforcement . MR. KING: Yes. MR. LITTLE: You mean Scranton Code Enforcement ? MR. KING: Yes. MR. LITTLE: Well, you know, I did a right to know with Oleski and I asked, you know, is there a Certificate of Occupancy and he sends me this temporary Certificate of Occupancy when they put in the security system that costs, I don't know, a couple million dollars they said. But, you know, when I figured out it all goes right to the top is when I -- because I talked to this guy Jason Kavulich who recently -- he's the head of Agency on Ageing. And I could go to the Agency on Ageing. I went 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 through four social workers . And I tell him, you know, these guys working there -- I thought it was a rogue guy. They're banging on my door. I have PTSD. I'm going crazy because I'm trying to work on saving my child in another state's family court. But the solution is with the persons that are focused that will provide critical support for older adult victims of abuse, neglect , and exploitation as well as those facing homelessness . And I listened to everything about, you know, how the police are chasing the homeless . The people that run Scranton Housing Authority are the District Attorney 's Office, Karl Lynott, 14 years District Attorney 's Office; David Coyne, 12 years District Attorney 's Office. They know all the police. I call the police and the police say see the manager when they burglarized all of my stuff. And thank you, Tom, for looking into this. But, you know, then it goes onto this Montgomery County Court Judge Lois Murphy, you know, on the Council of Elder Justice in the courts.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 I mean, most of those people that are homeless , they shouldn 't have even gone to court because SHA is federally subsidize d and they are constantly sending inflated bills to everybody which is under Pennsylvania law a retaliatory eviction and much more stuff than that. I mean, they're aggressively moving people out so they have their own little dominion and they control it with the fear of eviction , the fear of the District Attorneys coming to prosecute you. And when they come, the District Attorney , he's the witness and the prosecutor and everything . This is the problem with the homelessness thing. And I would like to see some of the good things that I've seen happening enforced like, hey, they have to have a license to rent to people because there is no oversight . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. LITTLE: Have a good Christmas . MR. KING: You too. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. CARTIER : Hello. My name is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Kurt Cartier and I live in Scranton . I just want to say I hope you guys are having good day and you're holding up well. I also want to say thank you to you guys for, you know, being supportive to the community . And I just want to keep on seeing the community work together to be more supportive to each other and also to allow the community itself to be better self-efficient with itself. And, you know, I came here before once talking about the less fortunate portion of the population that's here in Scranton . And, you know, I just -- I figure if we could help them do it and maintain themselves then we could continue to do that with everybody . And there would be a sturdy foundation in people being able to uphold themselves and continue to grow on having us be a more communicable community and continue to spread the love and to continue to spread the encouragement and the support with each other. And I just really want to encourage you all here to be willing to have open hearts and ears to situations like that and to do what you guys can with any situation like that and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 for anybody that may have any ideas to some of -- on the board. And I just want to say thank you guys very much and may God bless you all. MR. KING: Thank you very much. Have a good evening . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yeah, just a few. Mr. Voldenberg , for this and I'll get you all the details too. First one is demolition of city properties . I want to know if there's a specific code or specific guideline on what the level should be at the properties and if they are allowed to use large fill with stones, larger stones or anything that's sticking out. Some of the lots that were taken -- taking down the lots, a lot of big stones sticking out. And they're just getting -- they are hard to take care of and maintain in the future so I would like to know that. And also the lots that are being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 done, it seems they're running large equipment over the sidewalks to get into the lots and destroying the sidewalks . So I don't know if that is something that we could add into the contract that if you run over, you know, destroy the sidewalks with a 20 ton excavator that they should be replaced instead of letting the neighbors deal with it afterwards . So if there is any specifications if they could give me that or provide it so I could look over just to see what they are require d to do. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get the information , sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Another thing, DPW the front of 1405 South Webster , I went by. The people said there's 24 by 24 inch hole in the ground so I went by. And I did measure it. It is a little bigger than that. So if we're doing cold patch if he could have DPW go over there and take care of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SMURL: And code enforcement , the corner of Prospect Avenue and Maple Street, I believe this one has been going on a long 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 time. It's a multi-family unit. But the garbage is out every day of the week. I went by there right now and I went by it before I came here. And it's still out. Most of it is blown into the street and into the neighbor 's houses. So if we could find out who owns that and maybe send them a notice. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Okay. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, a few things. First, we spoke about it in caucus; but, Frank, if it's possible , could you reach out to Scranton Police Department for truck traffic on Railroad Avenue? I know we got some calls about it last week and you reached out to SPD but we didn't get anything back yet as far as I'm aware of, correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : No. No report or citation s as of today but I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so if we could see how the truck traffic is going. I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 they're possibly going over the weight limit there and if we're going to be using the scale and enforcing that traffic along Railroad . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. MR. SCHUSTER : Also, can we -- I know we got some lists. But it came up tonight again about the condemnation list for people that were are affected by the September 9th storm. Can we get a definitive list from the city administration as to properties that were condemned ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And also, homelessness came up a couple of times tonight if we could also reach out to the Scranton Police Department about the update on homelessness , what, if anything , is being done at this point in time and that the voucher program -- I'm sorry, the voucher program it's under way I think through Keystone and Weston Field, ask for an update on that. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't have any motions or comments at this time. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I got a few. So first of all, I would like to wish everybody a very Merry Christmas , Kwanzaa or Hanukkah or whatever anybody else celebrates , just enjoy a safe holiday season. So next, I got a couple things here. So the first one is this is a long-time concern of a resident . The specifics I'll e-mail you, Mr. Voldenberg . But they are two busy and dangerous intersections at South Scranton flats section would benefit immensely with traffic signal upgrades to enhance safety, improve traffic flow these junctions of South Washington Avenue and East Elm and Hickory Street. So I'll send you all of that correspondence . MR. VOLDENBERG : That did come into our office and I sent the request out today. MR. MCANDREW : Well, thank you for that. Also, in addition to what Councilman Schuster brought up about the truck traffic that has increased dramatically on Railroad 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 Avenue, it's causing major issues with the resident s because they appear to be illegal weights associated with these trucks. So a question may be posed to the water company because they are actually the ones, the trucks we're talking about. Do they have any other dumping locations throughout the city? My understanding is they might or did. Can we clarify that maybe to alleviate some of that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : All right. So in addition to that, a concerned resident came to me and, you know, with a valid concern . It has to do with handicap parking . So when you want a sign in front of your house you apply for it. You fill out some paperwork and you get it in front of your house. Then also as having a placard , you have to pay a $10 fee -- annual fee to the city. All right. So and the concerns brought to me -- and it's very valid is, you know, if you go through the, you know, the motions of filling out the paperwork and getting a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 handicap sign in front of your house, okay, and I know it's kind of sketchy with regards to what the state law is, but you should be able to park in front of your house without any problems because you are handicap ped and you are paying a $10 fee anyways. But, like, say, for instance , if you are severely handicap ped you go to the store and you come home and someone is parked in front of your house with a handicap placard or not because I know the city states that, well, anybody could park there as long as they have another handicap . That person can be from Taylor or Pittsburgh, who knows. But I don't think it's fair to the resident that they have to maybe park a block away or two blocks and carry groceries being handicap ped and struggling to get to their home where they have pretty much a designated spot but it might not be recognize d by, you know, either the state with that language of the city. So with that said, can we take a look at the ordinance , see if there is any, you know, anything we could change. We have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 power -- I know the state recommends , but sometime s at the city level we have the power to adapt it or modify it. Maybe, Mr. Gallagher , before, you know, you leave us and we're going to miss you greatly , could you take a peek at that for us? See if we could do something to help these residents because , you know what, I agree with them after listening to a couple about this concern . I actually agree with them that, you know, this really isn't fair if you look at it. And it's by nobody's fault but if we have the power to change it and make it fair then let's try to do that, okay? Thank you. Also we got a copy or responses of inquiries as Council over the month of November . I got one back. And so I'll read it. It says, "Councilman Mark McAndrew , per resident 's request a query for LIPS Code Enforcement Department . Has there ever been a condemnation of a property that was simply rescind ed back to the homeowner without going the appeal process ?" Simple question . The response I got from the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 administration is, "The city administration is respect fully seeking more information to assist answering this inquiry . Can Councilman McAndrew kindly provide more context ?" I think the question is -- send it again. My question again is, has there ever been condemnation of a property that was simply rescinded back to the homeowner without going through the appeal's process because it is the process ; if so, when and why? There, I'll expand on my context ; if so when, and why. I think it's a simple question . And my eyebrow always raises when you ask a question and you're answered with a question . So could you just please resend that for me? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll go back, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And let me see, I think that's all I have. Yep, that's it. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Response to Joan Hodowanitz with the status with the Serrenti Center, we're currently completing the ARPA fund with the HVAC project at Serrenti Center. Maybe this was -- I think it was Joan and Marie Schumacher were asking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 about this. It should be completed later this summer. $125,000 was for the construction of a classroom , evidence room. Oh, so this -- excuse me, this was the status as of July 23rd. And then I'll give you the present day status. So 125 was for construction of classroom and evidence room. They're currently working through some grant funding logistics will begin construction after that. December 23 status is the HVAC project has been paused due to a dispute with the contractor , which we've read in the paper an -- over submitted change orders. The plans for the classroom and evidence room project are currently being reviewed by an engineer . This is all we could share at this time due to the litigation . The intersection s of South Washington Avenue and East Elm Street and South Washington and Hickory Street, Council submitted a request to the city project manager , city engineer , Scranton Police Department and DPW to conduct a traffic and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 site study at the intersection of South Washington Avenue, East Elm Street in addition to South Washington Avenue and Hickory Street to see if the five lights or a three light signal, both with left turn green arrow may be employed at these intersections . Both intersections are already on the list for updated road markings . There was a question about meetings coming up. On Thursday , December 21st at 6 p.m., we're going to have a reorganization meeting in the Governor 's room -- Council will. And then on January 1st I believe at noon we're going have a swearing in. And then January 2nd, we'll have our typical caucus at 5:45 and our Council meeting at 6:30. Also, with respect to the Pennsylvania American Water Company , once again, I've been in close contact with the state representative s and State Senator Flynn's office. I'm working with the Mayor and City Council . We have a letter prepared that is going to go out. It's going to go out on behalf of the Mayor of the city, Scranton City Council , the Mayor of the Borough of Dunmore 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 and the Dunmore Borough Council . It's just about completed . And I have to get signatures from all five Council members up here along with our Mayor and then Dunmore plans to sign it and send that in. And part of that letter is, you know, obviously to oppose the outrageous increases -- water increases but also to request a hearing here in Scranton . So that's going to go out shortly prior to December 18th. I know that I think, Frank, we had copies made of the PUC complaint -- formal complaint . MR. VOLDENBERG : We do. And we have been sending them out via mail and e-mail and we have a group of copies on Alison's desk for the public. MR. KING: Okay. If anyone is interest ed in filing a formal complaint with the PUC over these rate hikes by Pennsylvania American Water Company , you could get a form here this evening . As he said, anyone that has been contact ing Frank, he's been mailing them out or e-mailing them out. We're hopefully going to get that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 link on the website . I think there's plans to set up an office across the street so that people could walk in and fill out the complaint forms. And I think they are planning to even mail them in for you. So there's a big push on with this. And I know actually there was a recent meeting , meeting with state reps all the way from Reading all the way up to the Scranton area. So there is a huge amount of opposition that is happening with this. So we'll continue to fight. And if we're fortunate , maybe we could even get them to turn back that the huge rate hike that happened last year, which really hurt people quite a bit. As far as the tax relief, this Council is going to, you know, we're working on the legislation to finalize it. There will be no tax relief until 2024. Tax bills haven't gone out for any of those. But the plan is that regardless of what the school district or what the county does, I know that this body is going to, you know, pass legislation to grant tax relief in 2024 -- for those individuals who lost, you know, their properties were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 condemned . So that is in the works. And I did mention that the solicitors , that was an e-mail from the Mayor today trying to get the solicitors together from the three entities , the city, the school district and the county because we still want to continue to push and, you know, work with those three entities because , you know, that's fine if the city's going to do it. But we really -- it's going to be more impactful on those individuals if we could get the school district and the county to grant tax relief for them as well so we're working to that end. And it did take time, you know, the flood happened September 9th. It took quite a while until all the information was gathered before it was determined which properties were condemned . And at this stage of the game, they haven't been taxed yet. The tax bills haven't been sent out and they won't be for quite a while. Hopefully they'll know well before that what tax relief they're going to receive . Let's see. I would like to wish good luck to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 Attorney Gallagher . He's going to be a new magistrate . He'll be getting sworn in after the new year. And I know he'll do a great job and he does have big shoes to fill. But I know he could do that and do it well. We'll miss him here. I do want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and happy Hanukkah , happy Kwanzaa , just everyone have a peaceful and enjoyable holiday season and thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE – FOR ADOPTION – FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 102, 2023 – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 100, 1976, ENTITLED “AN ORDINANCE (AS AMENDED ) LEVYING GENERAL AND SPECIAL TAXES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1977”, BY SETTING THE MILLAGE FOR THE YEAR 2024 AND THE SAME SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT ANNUALLY THEREAFTER . MR. KING: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final vote of Item 7-A. MR. KING: On the question ? Roll call, please. MR. MCANDREW : Wait. On the question . MR. KING: I'm sorry, on the question . MR. MCANDREW : So as stated last week I'm not in favor. I'm not going to say I'm not in favor of a tax increase . You know, being fiscally responsible and recently exiting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 Act 47 I was for one, incremental ones meaning like one percent . But not -- I wasn't for a tax increase that was going to fund new positions and above age raises. So, you know, like I said last week, I would have voted yes for an increase that would benefit the many and not the few. So for that reason I'll be voting no for the tax increase . MR. SCHUSTER : I'd also like to echo those sentiments . I didn't really plan on speaking on this tonight . But as Councilman McAndrew said, I would have been in favor of an incremental tax increase or incremental annual tax increase to not see those larger tax increases every so often. I did make some suggestions for amendments that I think that we -- I think it proved that we could cut from some of the expenditures of this budget. We didn't cut -- or we didn't -- I wouldn't say cut because the proposals that were made were large proposals over the whole of the budget. So we didn't pull back some of the pieces that were made by administration as far 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 as I would have liked to have. As Mr. McAndrew said, it seems like fewer people make out from this budget than the whole. If we were seeing larger paving projects , if we were seeing crime prevention , if we were seeing things like that that the citizens could have benefitted from, I would have been in favor of that. But as it stands as of right now, I am not. MR. KING: On the question , I'm voting for this tax increase because I believe it does affect the many. It affects every Scranton Police Officer in this city because they got an arbitration award. We have to pay for it. It affects the Scranton Fire Department . Every one of -- our men and women out there protect ing the city, keeping us safe fighting these fires, put their lives on the line every day. They are going to benefit from this tax increase . There is pension increases . So once again, they need to be paid for. We have nine projects scheduled in city parks which will greatly benefit citizens all across the entire city. So with that being said, I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 supporting this 2 percent incremental increase , which PEL has recommended that we do over the next few years coming out of Act 47. MR. MCANDREW : Without disputing , I mean, the nine parks are being funded by ARPA money, not taxes. I just want to make a point. That's all. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl.
