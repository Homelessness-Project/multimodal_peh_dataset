Let us also once again take a special moment of silence tonight for people in our community and throughout the world who are suffering or who have passed away from the coronavirus .

CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM MAYOR PAIGE G. COGNETTI AND CHIEF OF POLICE CARL R. GRAZIANO DATED JUNE 4, 2020 REGARDING OUTLINE OF CURRENT SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICIES . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I'd like to make a comment on the -- regarding the outline of the current police policies . I stated in caucus that, you know, a few years back that I think the police department looked at these policies and they have a pretty good procedure in place. And some of the comment s that we got from citizens in the last week or so that they want issues addressed that had already been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 addressed by the police department over the last decade, I would say. And I've seen some of these things in regards to mental health in action so they are some things that are working on in our area and surrounding areas. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Any other comments on Third Order items? MR. MCANDREW : I'll just piggyback on Mr. Schuster . I'm just glad we're in compliance . I mean, we are. We've been for a while. And that's just great to hear. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Anyone else? Okay. If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a reminder. This I made an announcement a couple weeks ago. The Wright Center Blood Drives are coming up. They're being done for the American Red Cross. They're Friday, June 12th from 11 to 4; Friday, July 31st from 12 to 5, both at the new facility -- the new Wright Center facility 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 which is on 501 South Abington -- South Washington Avenue. I'm sorry. Appointments are being done with 15 minute intervals . And you could register online or by calling the Red Cross of Northeast PA. That's all I have. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And real quick I just want -- for the record, I just want to state that Dr. Rothchild has joined us. Dr. Rothchild , are you there? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I'm here. Sorry about that guys. I'm having some technical issues tonight . But I am here. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. No problem . Okay. Anyone else have any announcements ? Okay. I just have one and I made this quite a few times now since we've been in the Zoom meeting s. But if anyone would like to comment on agenda items or City business , please send those comment s in writing to our City Clerk, Lori Reed by e-mailing LReed@scranton pa.gov. Council will accept public comment until the day of our meeting which is Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. Public comment is reviewed by the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Council prior to our meeting and is placed then on the official record and in the minutes of our meeting s. Council 's agenda is being posted for public review the Friday before our Tuesday meeting . Our agenda and minutes can be accessed by going to www.scrantonpa .gov and clicking on the City Council page. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN S PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. I'd ask now if someone would please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Patricia Nestor, Fay Franus, Eileen Dorsey, and Marie Schumacher . MR. SCHUSTER : I'll make a motion to accept public comment . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. There's been a motion made. There's been a second or has there been a second? MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a second. On the question . Sorry, Mark, go ahead. MR. MCANDREW : I'm sorry, on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 question , the one from Mrs. Nestor I will address in Fifth Order. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you. The only other thing I wanted to mention on public comment is two things. So Miss Franus had sent some comments in. Mrs. Reed, can you just double-check with the administration tomorrow whether or not they can get back to us with answers to Mrs. Franus's questions about the garbage -- the garbage fees? MS. REED: Yes. MR. GAUGHAN : And the -- one of the other citizens that had addressed Council was Eileen Dorsey. She had asked several questions . I could answer some of them I think right off the bat. They're calling for City budget data to be made readily available and accessible to the public on a quarterly basis. The City budget is posted on the City's website www.scrantonpa .gov. One of the things that Council has been calling for in the past was for data to be posted in terms of the budget on a quarterly basis. So I would agree with that statement and a call for that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Unfortunately , we're not at that point yet. There was a push I think about two or three years ago for the City to use a platform called open Gov -- open dot gov, something to that effect. For whatever reason that kind of fell through the cracks. I have talked to the Mayor in the last few months and I know one of the goals of her administration and I think one of the goals of this Council would be to get that data up for public review. So it's not up there now. But I'm hopeful that, you know, within the next few months to the next year that that would be an initiative that would be able to take place. Her second question talks about the institution of community lead public safety teams as well as citizens review boards for the Scranton Police Department , when will this happen? That will be a decision that will be made by Mayor Cognetti and Chief Graziano . And on our agenda tonight I believe Chief Graziano did address the citizens review boards in his comments . And I've sent quite a few emails out to people with similar questions and he has addressed that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 She also calls for police officers to be removed from schools and wants to know when that will happen. I'm not in favor of that at all. I think that would be a huge mistake . So I don't think anyone would want to entertain that at this point. And how will the City of Scranton expand police oversight measures and keep those measures in place? Again, I refer to Chief Graziano 's letter that's on the agenda. And lastly, Marie Schumacher had submitted several questions . She stated that she wanted information in Third Order this week in terms of the small business loan program . I did state last week that we were going to put that in Third Order. But after talking with Mrs. Reed and looking at it, that's not something we would generally put in Third Order because it's already on the City's website . We sent it to Mrs. Schumacher . And that's really more for the small businesses . If anybody 's interested in taking a look at that, it's already posted on the City's website . There's several other questions that, of course, we'll forward to the administration .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 One of the questions why was the 2020 real estate tax levy only on land and not improvements ? I thought I answered this last week or the week before. I'll just reiterate that the reasoning provided by the previous business administrator and PEL was that putting it on land and not improvements would be less punitive on the taxpayer . And, Mrs. Reed, if you could also follow up with the administration just in terms of previous question s that Miss Schumacher has asked that have not been answered yet. MS. REED: I will. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of -- all those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. (Public Comment , letters submitted by the following :1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 (Patricia Nestor) Other places I've lived allowed citizen ride alongs with the police. I called a couple years ago and Scranton does not allow this. As a way of being transparent and allowing community involvement and understanding , Scranton police should allow civilians to do ride alongs. (Fay Franus) Council , June 9 2020 I am going to start off with two quotes that surely fit the circumstances in this city: Here is a quote I heard the president of the NAACP say today: "Public sentiment is everything . With it you can accomplish almost everything . Without it practically nothing ." Here is another quote you can learn from: "Do you know what happens when you should have dealt with things from the past but did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 not? It is that you keep reliving the past." This City continues to tax the people to get money to pay for ALL OF THEIR MISTAKES IN THE PAST AND EVEN NOW You simply have not learned anything . You take the easy way out. One really has to wonder why anyone would write in comments and questions when that person knows it is a complete waste of their valuable time. But I shall continue because I must. Last week's meeting really was yet another sad state of affairs in this city. A couple thoughts about it. I found it fascinating that councilwoman Rothchild said she felt the law about people who work in Scranton must live in Scranton was antiquated but then went on to say she thought it was right for people who worked in Scranton should live in Scranton . Also Ms Rothechild stated that she also felt it was wrong to have Eileen Ciprianni have to move into the City after six months or have to leave if she did not move here-- because she would have been trained only to have to leave in six months which would not be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 fair and how experienced she was. My gosh has her memory escaped her. Mary Pat Ward started in January as head of OECD and was trained and in six months she was demoted to be able to give this very job to Eileen Ciprianni . No concern about how wrong that would be to have to do that to Mary Pat Ward. BUT surely wrong to have to do the same thing for Eileen Ciprianni . Double standard ???? Also Council woman Rothchild at the time Mary Pat Ward was hired said how qualified she was as well. But I guess taking Mary Pat Ward out of that position wouldn't be as bad as having to take out Eileen Ciprianni . Why I have no idea but Councilwoman Rothchild must think we are stupid or have no memory of all that happened here with Mary Pat Ward. She got discarded with not a blink of an eye to take care of probably one of Mayor Cognetti 's friend--or someone who has connections she may find useful in the future. Of course the real reason will never be told but I'm sure we will find out in time when Mayor Cognetti moves on to a bigger and better 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 job. I agree with Kyle Donahue completely on this topic. If you work in the city you must move into the city after 6 months-- we have laws. What you need to learn is how to follow them, not cherry pick parts to make everything look correct and as though you are doing what is legal. As Bill Gaughan stated it's at the Mayor's discretion --yes and it also states the person must move into the City after 6 months-- but Mr. Gaughan didn't want to read that out loud. But when Dave Bulzoni got a waiver Mr. Gaughan felt strongly that if you work in Scranton YOU MUST LIVE IN SCRANTON . PERIOD! As to Mr. Schuster 's comment Ms Ciprianni is a cabinet member and may only be here for 2 years-- that is her choice-- you take the job knowing this in advance it is no secret. You all want to twist facts to make it appear right to put Eileen Ciprianni in this position . It is still illegal for her to be working here before you gave her the waiver. Judge Mazoni stated this when it was about Dave 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Bulzoni -BUT you still went ahead and did it yet again anyway. Then we have Councilman McAndrew who received a letter from a citizen which he read to the public. Which tells me I suppose the only way I can have my questions , and comments read by all of you council members is to write you all emails then perhaps you WILL read them aloud as councilman McAndrew did, considering I have not yet received one reply from any one of you to this day. But because of the way you have this whole send in your comments thing people have no way of knowing you never replied to me--and many of my questions were questions that that did not have to be sent to the administration for replies --they were direct questions to you. How about when Bill Gaughan said last week after replying to ONE of Marie Schumacher 's question --I'm paraphrasing here it went something like this--"That answers Marie Schumacher 's questions ". Oh no it did not-- but people have no way of knowing how many questions Marie asked last week because you refused to read them. Your replies should be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 made public-- same as our questions and comments . Go back to March 31st and start reading my questions . I STILL want answers -- SILENCE is far from GOLDEN. It should be criminal ! Fay Franus (Eileen Dorsey) To Whom It May Concern : The following correspondence is a list of questions and requests being posed to the City Council by the citizens of the City of Scranton , in light of recent events which have galvanized us all and set the stage for local and national reform. We are calling for the city budget data to be made readily available /accessible to the public on a quarterly basis. ·We are calling for the institution of community -led Public Safety Teams as well as Citizens ' Review Boards for the Scranton Police Department . When will this happen?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 · We are calling for police officers to be removed from schools . ·How will the City of Scranton expand police oversight measures and keep those measures in place? This is a pivotal moment, and the people are looking to you. Thanks to the Council , in advance , for their consideration and immediate action. Sincerely , Eileen B. Dorsey (Marie Schumacher ) Last week, Mr. Gaughan states several of my questions about the Agena items would be answered by the program guidance that the mayo provided ; we'll put that in Third Order next week and it will be I'm sure on the webite and the public will be able to view that. That should take care of most of the questions here. Yesterday morning I received am e-mail from Mrs. Reed what I believe Mr. Gaughn 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 described as Guidance the Mayor provided . Oh, and when I reviewed the Agenda for tonight 's Meeting I could not find the Mayor's response in Third Order. I use response because out of seven items in my Fourth Order submission for the 26 May 2020 Meeting : O Two were designated as "City Council Questions " so I hope one of the five Council Members will provide the answers this evening . O One was acceptably answered . Twelve LERTA applications have been received since th 10-Year City-Wide Program was approved in February 2019. O One was an out-an-out ignoring an answer to the question and an excuse for not being able to provide the data required to fulfill recommendation . Allow me to explain : - my ignored question was what percent of the Trash bills have been payed to date? To me this was/is a no-brainer as if the Bill was not paid in full there would undoubtedly be a follow up; if the Bill was paid in full the payment would be $270 as the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 discount period extends to 15 July. In any case, the system must have a tally of the payments and I'm sure they know the number of Bills that were mailed so the percent should have been easy. Heck if they provided the raw numbers I would have calculated the percent myself. - the recommendation was that Council provide the percent on a weekly basis. The excuse I received is, "The CIty does not currently have the technology or system to provide that information on a weekly basis." This forces me to wonder just how archaic is our accounting system? The number of Bill mailed stays the same and I can't believe the number of payments aren't recorded on a daily basis. So a new request is for a copy of the Process for accounting for the Trash revenue account . o Another question (When will those of us "saving" our cominged (blue container ) for recycling rather than the KeystoneTrash Mountain be relieved of our collection ? What is the holdup and who is responsible for resolving the issue?) Received a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 not-in-my-court but I'm working on it anyway answer. For those inferested in the answer: - The Recycling Center is not currently collecting commingles (sic) (which seems redundant to me as I wouldn't be "saving" my blue container deposits if I didn't already know this) and this is beyond the CIty's control (which begs the question , have you met with the County Commissioners ). However , the City is looking into alternative recycling centers and programs o Answer to the question "When will the City join all of the others (sic) municipalities in the County and base the property taxes on a single assessed property value": The CIty will look into this request (to which I say thank you). However , we note that the lack of county assessment hinders our ability to have accurate assessment at the City level (to which I say, Are you lobbying the County Commissioners ? How many times have you met with them on this issue?) O To the question "Why was the 2020 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 real estate tax levy only on land and not improvements ." The answer was correct but my question should have specified the Council increase which I believed Mr. Gaughan has answered as it was because Mr. Bulzoni asked. O The final question dealt with the CIty's pulling the two-Fire Engine Stations from use as polling places after the final list was published as I thought it was only fair the City should then also notify registered voters of those polling places of the last minute changes . I will hold the balance of my questions and comments , save one each, until next week. - The Question : Was the March 2019 request for a Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program (RACP) grant for the renovation of the Municipal Building rejected by the State? - The Comment : When will the answers to the many other questions from me and other requesters be forthcoming . (End of Public Comment .) MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : The only comment I'd like to make is it's nice to see businesses start opening and us moving into some more lenient phases. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I have a few. So last week two questions were posed to me by concerned citizen s. And then I relayed them to Mrs. Reed to reach out to Chief Graziano . And then also the one that came today I want to address. So the one -- thank you, first of all, Chief Graziano , for your swift responses to these concerned citizens . So the first question last week was how many text while driving citations have been issued. So he responded and said 37 since 2016. And it has been implement ed but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 difficult to enforce . An example being, you know, a driver has to admit to it, first of all, and/or an officer has to actually witness a person sending or receiving a text. But in light of that, also what could be a little confusing is when this is being observed, the driver might be using his GPS, which is not considered texting . He might be scrolling through a number or dialling a number. So I hope that answers the question of that concerned citizen . The second one was how do we get a speed bump study done? And the response from the Chief was speed bumps are actually illegal . They're not allowed in the City streets . They could cause damage to City vehicles . You know, an example , you know, of the DPW trucks our blades during plowing . And these are also safety issues with trucks and drivers . So any that have been illegally constructed bumps that have been found around the City have been removed . So thanks for that answer. And then today we received a public comment question from Mrs. Nestor. And her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 question was other places she has lived allowed citizen ride-alongs with the police. She called a couple years ago and was told Scranton does not allow this. As a way of being transparent and allowing involvement and understanding , Scranton Police should allow citizens to do a ride-along. So the Chief had, you know, his response was, we do have a very active ride-along program and has been in place for many years. This individual , maybe Mrs. Nestor, might have called the police department asking about this maybe during the Covid -- COVID-19 restrictions . And if that's the case, we obviously have the program currently suspend ed because of restrictions . However , it will be opened up once again as the COVID-19 restriction s are released . So at that point, you know, she could inquire again. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't have any. No, I don't have any motions or comments at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. DONAHUE : Quick comment . Yesterday I met with Tom Preambo the new Director of DPW. And I just want to thank him for taking the time out of his schedule . We just went over a couple of initiatives that will be upcoming and, you know, what we see are some of the deficiencies , you know, within DPW and how we can better operate . And I was also made aware today that I know we were told that the ad for the RFP for the engineering service for street paving went out last week. But they needed to make a couple corrections to it regarding ADA ramps. So that will -- I believe that's going to go out either later -- it either went out later this afternoon to the Times for the ad or it will go out tomorrow morning . So it should be in the paper the next couple days there. Miss Reed, would we be able to send 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 correspond ence to the administration regarding the reopening of City Hall and what processes we're going to use moving forward with that? MS. REED: Certainly . MR. DONAHUE : On top of that too, just some questions on the furloughs because as we reopen City Hall, hopefully , you know, some of the people that -- some of the City employee s that have been furloughed will be called back. So what will be the process -- and I could send all of this to you in an e-mail too. But what will be the process on how they will be called back, when will they be called back, how many won't be called back. And if there's even the slightest possibility that any worker won't be called back, you know, the administration has to just be up front and honest with those employees instead of keeping them in the dark on their employment status. And I think Council also needs to be provided with detailed explanations of who will take on the duties of these positions if those employees -- if certain employees aren't called back. And also just who is performing the work 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 now? A couple examples , who's processing garbage bills? Who's performing health inspections of restaurants ? Who's performing housing inspections ? Who's responding to quality of life complaint s? Who's overseeing the bidding and purchasing process , just as a couple of examples . So we'll pass that along to the administration and see what kind of answers we get. And that's all I have for tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Council man Donahue . I just have one comment . I'd like for a letter to be sent to the Mayor and the City Law Department and City Solicitor Jessica Eskra. I would like an update in regards to Northeast Revenue Services and the conditions that were stated in Attorney Eskra's letter to Sean Shamany from NRS on October 16th, 2019. Specifically I would like a copy of all correspond ence between the City of Scranton and NRS from January 1st, 2014 to present . As part of this correspond ence back in 2019, the City asked that the NRS ensure the prompt 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 exchange of all databases in a format acceptable to the City for all tax and refuse collection to the City and/or its designee . I would like to know if that has happened yet. NRS's IT Department and the City's IT Department would agree to work together in good faith to achieve a timely transition of data. I'd like to know if that has occurred yet. NRS will upload the 2019 payment s to its server to be combined with the data that will be transferred to the City and/or its designee . I'd like to know if that has happened yet. NRS will proceed with the filing of delinquent refuse liens for Calendar Year 2018, has the same already been prepared and ready for filing. It says, however , NRS will not proceed with the filing of 2018 delinquent tax liens. I'd like to get an update on that and know if that has happened yet. Also, it states that NRS will provide the City with a total dollar amount of cost advance d on liens that have been filed on behalf of the City. At that time the City wanted to see this amount within ten business days of October 16th, 2019. So I'd like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 know if that had occurred . And the City would require assurances in writing from NRS that the termination of this contract would not result in litigation . And I'd like to know if that has happened yet. So, Mrs. Reed, and Solicitor Hayes, if you could put that together and get that out to the Law Department and the Mayor and I would appreciate it. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS.
