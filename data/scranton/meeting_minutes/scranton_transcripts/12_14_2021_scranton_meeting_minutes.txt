AMENDMENTS TO THE CITY OF SCRANTON 2022 GENERAL OPERATING BUDGET. MR. GAUGHAN : Do any Council members have any comment s on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have one quickly . The incoming Council that will be seated in January will hold a public caucus this Thursday , December 16th at 5 p.m., in the Governor 's room to discuss reorganization . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have two that I wanted to mention . Maybe a couple weeks ago I had mentioned we're having a vaccine clinic that the City was hosting . We're going to be having another one. It's going to be from 2 to 6:00 on December 28th. And that will be at the Reserve Center on 1801 Pine Street. And that will also be with Scranton Primary Health Center and State Department of Health are partnering with them. And you'll be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 able to receive Moderna , Pfizer or the Johnson and Johnson vaccine there for first, second shots and boosters , ages 16 and above. Pfizer for five and above and flu vaccines will be there too. So I had gotten my flu vaccine and I just got my booster last week which I'm happy to say. So I just want to encourage the public to get your vaccinations as well. And then the second announcement that I had Mr. Bob Bolus had requested if we could announce his annual Christmas dinner that will be taking place. That's going to be at St. Pat's on Jackson Street. And it will be from 12 to 6 p.m. And I believe that's on Christmas Day that he hosts it. They will be doing takeouts and deliveries . They are looking for volunteers as well. If you want to request the takeout or delivery , you can call 570-346-7649. And that's all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I have a couple announcement s. It's with a heavy heart that I announce the passing of two great retired Scranton Firefighters . They were very close 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 friends of the family, Neil MacDonald, served the City for 28 years as a retired -- retired as a Captain and Robert Herky Durkin, a very dear friend that was a larger than life person. Herky served the City 35 years starting as a police officer and retired as a fire inspector . My heart, thoughts and prayers go out to the families of these two proud firefighters . Secondly , I would like to announce the 9th annual McAndrew Cookies for Kids Cancer Bake Sale Event. With safety always being a top priority , we've decided that this year we can't host an actual in-person bake sale. So like last year we did a virtual cookie chain. And for those who are new, a cookie chain is a way for the bake sale event to live on and to continue our mission . So if you're not a baker, you can simply donate to our fundraising page on Facebook . And due to the recent passing of a dear friend and strong support er of Cookies for Kids Cancer, we would like to dedicate this year's donation in memory of Mark O'Malley. Mark never missed a cookie event or any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 opportunity to support his friends and community . So when you submit your kids donation this year to Cookies For Kids Cancer, please keep his giving and generous spirit in mind. With that said, I would like to say how very proud I am of my family, my students , and our generous community . Over the past nine years we have raised $60,000 for less toxic drugs as treatment for the brave children of this horrific disease . And also, the Police Department , they are having three upcoming events that will be put on by the Scranton Police Department , Wednesday , December 15th, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., there will be a Scranton Police and meet -- a police meet and greet, second floor of the Marketplace at Steamtown . Then Thursday , December , 16th, there will be a car seat safety check at Toyota of Scranton , 3400 North Main Avenue from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. You could have your kids -- your child's car seat checked and also a chance to win a gift card from a local business . And then Thursday the 21st beginning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 at 4 p.m., Santa will be joining members of the Scranton Police Department to spread holiday cheer, check the official Scranton Police Department Facebook page, which is Be Part of the Solution for all the times and the stops that they will be having. And then lastly, Saturday , December 25th from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., the Backyard Alehouse will have a free Christmas breakfast . It will be free takeout breakfast along with new or gently used clothing for children and adults, also toys and nonperishable food items. This event is open to all but especially those who are alone and are in need of a little extra cheer on Christmas . That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? I want to thank Mark and his family too for the work that they do with the charity that he just mentioned . It's a wonderful thing. And I don't think Councilman McAndrew also gets enough credit for the Hometown Heros Banner Program that was really started under his direction . So I want to thank him for that. Mr. Voldenberg ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : The first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz in Scranton . Okay, what's the story on the audit this week? MR. GAUGHAN : We don't have it. MS. HODOWANITZ : And it looks like since there is nothing in legislation with regard to the new union contracts except we're ending the year without any legislation with regards to that. Those contracts are going to expire on December 31st. So it shall be an interesting January . And we're still looking for the missing documents for the firefighters to be posted to the City's website . But I've only been asking since June, so I'll give you a little time. MR. DONAHUE : I've been asking just as much as you have. MS. HODOWANITZ : With regard to Item 6-A, pocket park being named after Mayor Doherty , I don't think a lot about Mayor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Doherty . He's not here nor there in my mind. But I don't see him as being such an outstanding mayor overall to be warranted this kind of recognition . After all, he was the mayor on whose watch we had the double pensions scandal . But above and beyond that, it annoys me that after the brouhaha about Biden Street, apparently it didn't occur to anybody to solicit citizen input on who we might honor with the name of that park? I have four names that came to mind tonight : Tony Santoli , Bernie McGurl, Captain Robeson who died fighting a fire and Officer John Wilding who died pursuing criminals . These four people who have served the City year after year, two of whom gave their lives for this City, four people who would deserve such an honor. And I'm sorry, but I just don't think because he was the mayor and what he did for parks and recreations entitles him to that kind of recognition . And you heard week after week how people were distressed that we were renaming Spruce Street and the expressway after 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 President Biden. And for many people thought that was inappropriate . Was there any attempt to ask for citizen input on this -- this naming? MR. GAUGHAN : No, there was not. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, shame on you. Shame on you. You should have done that. I know you're going to pass this resolution and so be it. But when we have citizens like Santoli , McGurl, Robeson and Wilding , how we can over look them -- MR. GAUGHAN : Miss Hodowanitz , we didn't overlook anyone. I explain ed why we were doing this last week, which -- and I don't want to take your time up. But you are combining two things that Mayor Doherty was known for, that's the revitalization of the downtown , downtown living. There would be no park. There would be no reason for a green space downtown if it were not for his vision and his commitment to the park system. So it's not as if we said, jeez, let's name this after this person or that person. There was a definitive reason why we did it. It's not like we said, well, this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 person is better than that person. That's not the -- MS. HODOWANITZ : I'll disagree with your rational e on this. I'm not even sure we needed a pocket park on that corner. I think we ended up with a pocket park because there was nothing we could do with that piece of property considering the amount of contamination that was there. But be that as it may, should there ever be an opportunity to name something else, I recommend one, you solicit citizen input; and two, you look beyond politicians . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Jack White. MR. WHITE: Hi Council . I hope you're enjoying the peace, solitude and darkness on these days of advent leading up to the season of light on December 21st when our days start getting longer. I took pictures . I talked about Moosic Street last time I was here and the ditch due to erosion on the south side of the road, I guess, all the way, the whole block, deep, deep ruts. I suggested gravel to fill it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 in, which again is a day's work with City DPW supplies of gravel. Easy fix. But I was over there today. I took pictures -- more pictures . There are a bunch of pylons lined up, lots of them, 15 or 20. Somebody is listening. Somebody is listening. Coincidently a few days before that I got a note in my mailbox and it said, "If city government won't do it, we will." And it was signed -- the phone number is there. And it was signed Saul Alinski . He's a change agent. He talks about a cooperative method procedure for change, cooperative . And if that don't work, conflict . So Saul Alinski is no longer with us. But as a social worker and organizer I was thrilled . I was thrilled because somewhere he's alive and well. So anyway, I did take pictures but I forgot them. I left them home. And while I was there, an older woman kind of tiny woman was walking her tiny dog. And he slipped and went into a rut. He got startled -- he or she, jumped out which startled the woman and she went down. She didn't get -- well, she -- her hands and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 knees were scraped . Fortunately , she got her hands out in time. It could have been her head. So anyway, the pylons are there. They look good. They're a little bit safer, a little bit safer. But if you don't know that area, it's pretty dangerous . I think she may have hurt her ankle. I offered her a ride, no thank you -- her and her dog, no thank you -- lovely, lovely woman. So anyway, I'll bring the pictures next time. Again, I hope you have the peace of the season in your heart, in your soul. And I hope you can attend to some of these smaller neighborhood things. The neighbors -- there's a nice little hamlet that's on Harrison where it meets Moosic, a little hamlet that's really kind of nice. But a few months ago it wasn't. Garbage was piling up in this beautiful entryway to Scranton in the Hill Section . And I talked to Dr. Bob who lives right on the corner. I said, you know, you're wrecking it here. He said, it's not me. It's them. It's not them. And so I talked to a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 couple of them. It's not me. It's him. It's her. It's Dr. Bob. The garbage was two months. We ended up hauling it away, a lot of it to where I put my garbage . It's so nice now that we got together . We had meetings . We talked. And there was misunderstandings and conflict . Now, Christmas decorations , people are chatting it up. They're shovelling each other's sidewalks . It's beautiful . So any time you want, get a yellow vest. Come on over. We got stuff to do. Thanks guys. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. WHITE: I have a standing meeting every Tuesday after this so -- MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Thanks for letting us know. Have a good night. Next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner , taxpayer . Last week, Councilman Gaughan , during your comments you were praising Mayor Doherty for the great job he did with the parks and how nice parks bring people into the City.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 It sounded really familiar to me. It sounded like when Chris Doherty was in office, all the puppets on City Council , they said the exact same thing; and nobody came into the City because nobody wants to come into a City that has nice parks. People want to come into the city that has jobs. And under Chris Doherty we lost over 3,000. That's why nobody came into the city. I could just see people wanting to move here. Oh, let's move into Scranton . We won't have a job but we'll be able to sit in the park and feed the pigeons . That's not happening . It's ridiculous for people to think that parks are going to bring people into the City. And Nay Aug Park you said it was a jewel. Well, compared to when I was growing up, right now Nay Aug Park is like a rock, not a jewel. It was a jewel when I was growing up. There was stuff to do up there. There was the zoo, which none of you were around when that happened when we had the zoo. There was an arcade. There were rides. There were Dodge Ems in the arcade. There was tons of stuff to do up at Nay Aug Park.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 What could you do there now, go up there and sit on the park bench or walk around. Believe me, it is not a jewel. And Chris Doherty had nothing to do with it. And he should not be -- have a park named after him. I agree with Joan 100 percent , the four people that she mentioned are awesome people. At least Jimmy Robeson has a street going into Isaac Tripp School named after him. There are much -- many more people qualified to have the park named after them than Chris Doherty . Like I said, last week he cost us 40 million dollars and almost bankrupted the City. Next thing, I read in the paper today about the changes you made with the budget. What I didn't read was how you helped the citizen s of this City? None of that stuff you did helped the taxpayer s of the City. It didn't lower our taxes. It didn't lower the garbage tax or get rid of it altogether . You people run on a promise that you're going to help the taxpayer s but you get into office and you don't to it. It's just lie after lie after lie. Oh, and going back to the park, any of you that vote to pass this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 legislation , you'll never see my support in an election again. And I supported some of you. I cannot support anybody that supports Chris Doherty because he almost killed this City. But once again, like I said, I've been coming to these meeting s a long time. You're not the only Council to -- taxpayers don't get any help from you people. And you're suppose d to be working for us. But it seems like you're just working for yourselves. Lastly, when you're coming off the Biden Expressway into the City to turn onto Madison Avenue, as soon as you make a right to hit Madison Avenue, there's an abandoned car there. There is no license plate on it. It's been there for over a month. I stopped to look the other day. There's a tag under the windshield wiper. It says abandoned vehicle . I don't know if the police put that there or whatever , but it's been in that place. It's been well over a month, no license plate. And it's tagged as an abandoned vehicle . I don't know why it's still there. It's right on Madison Avenue as soon as you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 make the turn off the expressway . Maybe it could get towed out of there. It's a silver Toyota Camry. To me it's turning into an eyesore . Well, that's all I have tonight . And I want to wish everybody a happy holiday . And we'll see you next year. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening Council , Lee Morgan. Listening to Les speak tonight is just one more reason why the Home Rule Charter needs to be reviewed and rewritten , not just for the City but maybe also for the county because city government really hasn't worked for the residents . And I've been going to these Council meeting s long over 30 years. And we've just -- it's just terrible where we are. And when we start talking about naming a city park after Chris Doherty , it gets a little ridiculous . It's not quite as bad as naming anything after Joseph Biden but it's close. You know, you got to take a look at what this gentleman did. He built the pool 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 house at Nay Aug. The cost was just horrendous . But he didn't maintain the pool. He pushed the City into Act 47. He built a parking garage and said -- and the Council that was seated at the time if you read the minutes said that the City could no way afford that parking garage. But he built it anyhow. But he said look at the skyline because when's the last time you saw a crane over the City of Scranton . He monetized City assets and borrowed against them. He worked with the former Governor Rendell to break municipal unions and almost bankrupted the City in the process . At the time there were City employees coming here. He was offering them double pension s to retire. Well, the union was pushing it. Take it. The money's there. Take it. If he's going to give you it -- I was here for all of this stuff. Well, they did. And in the end you saw how that turned out, all right, they got stripped of it all. He spent millions of dollars in Nay Aug Park. He was going to restore the pride. This man was going to restore the pride in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Scrantonians , pride of the City, okay, because well, I don't know. He used Licensing and Inspections as a weapon. The City was sued over it. I think they lost. I mean, this is why the resident s in this City need to review the Home Rule Charter . We need to -- and look it, I don't expect the Scranton Times to write anything that is said here. But we don't need them to write anything . The residents in this City have to realize one thing. After being in distress for over 30 years, what's the City really look like coming out the other end? I think just, my personal opinion , that when former Mayor Courtright was prosecuted , there should have been investigations into the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority , of its reserve fund where that money went to, and the privatization of the Scranton Parking Authority and also giving one of those structures away and then giving a million dollars to the person who then was going to own it. I think Scranton in my own opinion has been a hot bed of corruption for my whole 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 lifetime . And I think that the resident s, they don't want to face the reality that the government we have just doesn't work. And it's time to really realize that this isn't working and we can write a charter and control every single thing of where the grant money goes, everything that this Council can do. We could build parameters around everything . And we can write it like the legislation that Council writes so that if one part of it is found to be illegal , it doesn't set aside the whole document because really naming that park after Mr. Doherty is an injustice to the residents of Scranton . It's like what the Lace Curtain Irish did to the Shanty Irish in Ireland , two sets of laws, two sets of rules. And that's what we've got to realize . And if you want to name a park after somebody that's a Scrantonian that deserves it, name it after Mark Walsh. Do your own research . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Would anyone else like to address Council tonight ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I'd like to start tonight with asking if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 anybody knows why we've had so many rebidding s. I don't -- MR. GAUGHAN : Well, I mean, because people aren't bidding on -- people aren't bidding on these RFP or RFQs. That's why they -- MS. SCHUMACHER : They're not bidding ? MR. GAUGHAN : Well, the reason that you would rebid is because no one bid on it. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, well -- MR. GAUGHAN : Either that or someone bid and they had to throw the bid out because they didn't provide the correct specifications . MS. SCHUMACHER : Because there have been a lot. And those are not cheap to put in the paper over and over and over. MR. GAUGHAN : Um hum. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Well, has anybody ever talked to anybody about that though? I mean, are they just don't want to work with Scranton or they don't want the jobs? I don't know. It just seems strange all of a sudden there is so many rebids. Okay, moving on then, can anybody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 tell me the status of the demolition of that garage in the 1700 block of Wyoming Avenue? Is it gone? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't have an update. I believe it's still standing . MS. SCHUMACHER : Why? MR. GAUGHAN : I think we covered this last week but there's a dispute between the gentleman that owns the garage and the City at this point. MS. SCHUMACHER : I thought they had a meeting this week. MR. GAUGHAN : They had a meeting on Tuesday . But as far as I know, the dispute is still not resolved and the garage is still standing . MS. SCHUMACHER : Unbelievable . Regarding the pocket park, I've noticed since about, I don't know, late spring, early summer nothing has changed there. And I don't understand why it hasn't moved along more than it has. Has DEP given us a -- whatever they do, certify that it's clean or is there a problem -- I'm sorry. MR. GAUGHAN : The final update -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 the last update I received was that it would be completed in the summer of next year and everything is moving along. So you may not see there was some work that had been done there, a lot of work being done probably in the spring you'll see things start to pick up. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And what about even Scranton Tomorrow ? They used to come in on, what, a quarterly basis? Have they been in? MR. GAUGHAN : They'll come in next year. Yeah, we were suppose d to schedule something , but there was conflicts between their schedule and our schedule . Plus, we had all the budget work sessions which I thought was more important . MS. SCHUMACHER : What about the Chamber ? It just does not nice things to me when I go by and I get stopped at that traffic signal and I see that same old thing, work in Scranton 10 years, no taxes. That's just a lie. How do we allow that? They're our marketeer? That's scary into itself. They are the LERTA marketeer. MR. GAUGHAN : We have no -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Councilman Donahue I know talked to I think Bob Durkin. MR. DONAHUE : I'm sorry, I completely forgot about your request from last week. But I'll reach out to him again. MS. SCHUMACHER : How are they doing on the LERTAs? Have we had -- MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, we had that discussion with them last time. And they said they were going to take it down. So I don't know why it's back up. But I will find that out for you. I apologize for not getting that this week. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. What about Serrenti ? I didn't see anything in the budget about Serrenti . Is that still a police project ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, it's mostly being funded through grants. They did give us an update. I thought we put it in Third Order within the last few weeks. But they gave us a breakdown of the cost, what they plan on doing and how they spent the money so far. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And when Joan brought up Wilding 's name, it reminded me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 of a couple years ago I checked the code to see because after he had that fall, there was going to be a code change requiring fencing when you had downward steps that somebody could do that. And I don't think that ever happened. MR. GAUGHAN : I'd have to go back and look. MS. SCHUMACHER : That would be a great thing to do though. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I agree. MS. SCHUMACHER : If it happened once, it could happen again. And I think -- okay, I'm about out of time and Merry Christmas to all and a good '22. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. DOBRZYN : I'm going to drum on that no taxes. What is that all about? MR. GAUGHAN : I'm sorry, what? MR. DOBRZYN : This no taxes come to Scranton , don't pay taxes for 10 years. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, no, I don't know why they framed it that way. What the whole purpose of the citywide LERTA was a few years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 ago was to try to spur construction for people who live in the City or businesses who were looking to relocate to the City. So you would get a 10 year exemption on city, county, and property school taxes just for the improvement . You would only pay on the land for 10 years. We've seen a little bit of success with it but not to the degree that I think we would have thought . MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, you're still paying something . You're just not paying -- MR. DOBRZYN : How about wage taxes and so forth? MR. DONAHUE : No, everything else is still normal. MR. GAUGHAN : Still the same. MR. DOBRZYN : I mean, I suppose it's okay. But my only message is, if you don't want to join the community and pay your dues, please don't come, you know, we don't need you. We have enough 36 percent tax exempt. That's what I've been drumming about that for years, you know? And I'd love to reconstitute the taxpayers strictly on Scranton issues. In 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 other words, exclusive and start figuring out ways to get into the Courts over this because it's excessive. It's totally excessive. I have a house next to me went for 2 or $3,000 in back taxes. The landlord is now charging $1,300 a month. And it's a shack, you know? They did some improvements . But it's a shack. Okay. Once again, is our audit in? I apologize . I came a little late. The general audit is still not -- MR. GAUGHAN : Most of the audit -- the audit is pretty much complete . We're waiting on the authorities to get their audit in -- just the Sewer Authority . There's a problem with that. If the City were to issue it at this point they'd have an adverse opinion because they would not have included that. MR. DOBRZYN : I think if they don't have it in by May 30th, that's the date, they should be given a two-month notice that their job no longer exists at least by August 1st, you know? One of the things I heard, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right. The Sewer Authority and, I mean, this guy was in here drumming Council -- three Councils ago about what a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 great idea it would be to do all of this with the sewer. My water bill is twice as much. So one thing I will always remember you for, you called it a back door attack. And that's what it is. It's about 600 more dollars a year I'm spending on water than what I used to. I understand upgrades were needed to be done. But the upgrades if you really thought of how many houses we serviced and it was Scranton and Dunmore with the Sewer Authority , it might not have been anywhere near that much every month. You know, it went from about $55 to 100, 110. It's like talk about inflation , you know? Well, last weekend we reached a milestone of 800,000 people dead. And by the way, I don't know if it's that way today if somebody is found dead in their home a little old lady or whoever, they're not -- they weren't being tested for COVID. They were not being tested. So we might be at a million right now as we speak. Nobody was tested if -- it was considered a waste of a test kit to test somebody that was already deceased . And it's really is a shame. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 And I'd like to thank all of the antivaxers and the people spreading this information . It's just a shame because guess what gang, I resent you and it's starting to borderline on the hate word because you're liars. You're stealing people's last breath. Thank you and have a good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. MR. DOBRZYN : That goes for antivaxers with their misinformation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments this evening ? MR. SCHUSTER : Just one comment I'd like to make is, I'd like to thank President Gaughan and Solicitor Hayes for their service to the City of Scranton . In my time here on Council it's been a pleasure to work with both of them. And I know they'll be missed, and I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 wish them the best of luck in the future. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Next speaker -- I'm sorry. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s? MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. I'd like to echo the same sentiment s as Mr. Schuster . It's been a pleasure and an honor to sit next to you for almost two years. I'm very proud of you. You've always been a force of the residents . And, Kevin, it's been also awesome working with you. Your eye for detail and your support and wisdom has been by well received by Council . I also have some things brought to my attention by some concerned citizens , some complaints . So on the corner of Ash and Capouse , I think we had a problem there before. There're tires -- they're stacking tires on the sidewalk s. So it's right across the street from John Adams School. So, Mr. Voldenberg , take, you know, if you could inquire about that. I think it's been an issue before. I think it continue s, so if you could look into that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 And then also, I have another concern brought up by a citizen . And it's a really weird one. It's on 436 8th Avenue in West Scranton . It was a vacant lot. It was purchased -- I'm not sure when, a few years back is what I'm told. And it wasn't purchase d, like, say by a neighbor buying the lot next door. But there's a camper on it. And it's very suspicious activity they believe is going on there. The lot is overgrown. It's like a jungle. There's a car. So it looks like someone is either living in this camper or doing stuff inside this camper. So it's kind of tucked away. It's hidden behind Price Rite on Luzerne Street. It's a weird little area to find. But I did take a ride by it. It does look -- it doesn't look right. So there's like a light blinking on the camper on the exterior of the camper. So if you could please inquire about that. And that is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s this evening ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 DR. ROTHCHILD : I want to echo the sentiments . I also really appreciated working with Solicitor Hayes as well as Councilman Gaughan . It's just been a pleasure . I've learned a lot from the both of them and I appreciate having them here. And I wish them the best of luck in the future. That's it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments this evening ? MR. DONAHUE : I'm going to save most of my comment s for budget items. But I just want to wish everyone a happy holidays , happy new year. And I'll save my praise for both President Gaughan and Solicitor Hayes for January 3rd. MR. GAUGHAN : Are you sure? You don't want to do it now? MR. DONAHUE : No, I'll do it then. MR. GAUGHAN : This is a great meeting , you know, everybody is giving thanks. So this -- my last official meeting as was mentioned will be Monday, January 3rd when the new Council gets sworn in. But tonight is my last actual 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Council meeting with any business on the agenda. So I wanted to take a brief moment to say a few words. I know we have a long meeting in front of us with all the amendments . But after eight years I do need to say a few things. The first thing is, I want to thank my colleague s who sit up here with me, Dr. Rothchild , Councilman Donahue , Councilman McAndrew and Councilman Schuster . It's been a pleasure working with all of you. As they all know, this is sometime s a thankless job. And I know the hard work that they all put in. And not only the fact that they are my colleague , but when you sit up here with people every Tuesday once a week you become friends with them. You get to know their family. So that's been really important to me. And it's been nice to get to know them and their children and their family. So I want to thank them for all the hard work and their dedication to the City of Scranton . You could say what you want about any Council member present or past. But there is one thing that has been a constant at least in my mind and that is that people really do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 care about the City whether you agree with the vote that they took or a stance that they have taken tonight or any time in the past. They do really care about the City. I've worked with a lot of Council people over the years, Jack Lascombe , Bob McGoff, God rest his soul, Joe Wechsler , Pat Rogan, Mary Walsh Dempsey , Wayne Evans and Tim Perry. I want to thank them. It was a pleasure working with them as well. I want to thank our City Clerk, Frank Voldenberg . I said earlier this evening this man has ice in his veins. Nothing phases this guy. He's been a really great addition to our staff, wonderful . Outside of the fact that he's a good City Clerk, he's a wonderful person and he's a gentleman 's gentleman . Everyone in this building has a lot respect for him because he's truly a good person. And, Frank, I want to thank you for the work that you've done. It's been great working with you. I also want to thank our former City Clerk, Lori Reed. Obviously she's no longer with us in the building . But I still keep in contact with her. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 She was also wonderful to work with. We got our start a number of years ago in City Hall. I got to meet her when I worked in OECD and I got to know her very well and her family. And she was just an outstanding clerk and an outstanding person. I also want to thank our Council Solicitor , Kevin Hayes. This is his last meeting as well. As everyone mentioned , you know, Kevin is an ethical person. He is a person who -- I don't know how he works the hours he does. He literally does not stop working . He cares deeply about the City. He has a deep commitment to Scranton . And I just want to thank him. It's not an easy job that he's in either. And he's really gone above and beyond with the work that he's done. So thank you very much, Kevin, for all that you've done here. And again, just as I stated earlier , you get to know all of these people. And Kevin and I over the course of the last few years have become friends because he also happens to be a wonderful person and he has a wonderful 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 family. I want to thank Kathy Carrera who works in our office. Kathy has done a phenomenal job. Again, some of the people like Kathy and Allison who sits here who's also done a great job, started last April. People don't see the things that they do. They make this all work for us. And they put all the items together for us and do a lot of things behind the scenes. And they just do a great job. And they truly care about the City. I want to take a second and also thank my family. I'll do this again on the third so this -- you know, I was very, very lucky to have the full force of my family behind every campaign -- well, I ran two campaigns . If it wasn't for them, I would have never been elected. You really do in a city our size with the amount of neighborhoods we have and the ground you have to cover, you need a strong family support behind you. So, of course, I want to thank my wife Kelly. She was just phenomenal over the last eight years in terms of, you know, raising our children , taking care 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 of our children . I'm in and out all the time with meeting s and everything else. And she's just done a great job and has been very supportive . My children , Jack, Murphy, Mave and Mary, it's funny we had Jack in 2015. So I've had four children over the course of my tenure on Council , so a lot memories here. I want to thank my mother Marie and my father Jack. If I told them I was moving to Alaska tomorrow they would say, okay, here's gas money and, you know, tell us what you want to do. They have just been a sounding board for me ever since I was a little kid. They were just great. They always say they're proud of me, but I'm proud of them. They are wonderful parents. My brother Eddie and Jackie, my sisters Katie and Kelly always helped out and worked on my campaign . And I want to thank them. They've been great. I had the unique family in the fact that I have a lot of aunts and uncles and they -- if it wasn't for them, I could have never been here because they literal ly worked on my campaign 24/7. My aunt Ann, Peggy, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Kathy, Pat, Maureen , Linda and Bonita, my uncles Jerry, John, and Billy, they were the nucleus of my campaign every time I ran, took me around door to door and they did a great job. My uncle Billy and Jim Gaughan always big supporters of mine. All of my cousins , we'd be here for another five hours if I was to go through all of them. But they were wonderful . And one of the great highlight s for me to be on this Council was the fact that my grandmother Helen Trently who her father stood at that podium in the 30s and 40s, ran for Council , sheriff big into politics ; she got to see me take office before she passed away. And she was a big force behind my campaign . That's how I really got involved in politics was watching how she handled herself with such grace. And my grandfather Edward Trently , my grandparents Elizabeth and William Gaughan . So my entire family has been phenomenal . Eight years up here has gone by very quickly in the blink of an eye. When people say time goes by fast, wow, does it ever. It seems like yesterday 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 that I was sitting next to my friend former Council President Bob McGoff talking about the issues facing the City at that time in 2014. Many things have changed on and off over the last eight years except you, the people of our City. It's been an honor and a privilege to represent you in these chambers . And I've always said since I was in grade school that I wanted to help people when I got older. And this is the perfect job to do that. There would have been no other position that would have afforded me the opportunity to meet so many wonderful people throughout every corner of the City of Scranton . I sat across the kitchen table from many of you, listened to your stories , your struggles ; and I realize d time and time again that what makes this City great, what makes this job worth it, what makes it worth it to come here every Tuesday and spend all the hours that we do is you. This is what makes the job special . And I only hope that my time here as a Councilman could be an example to my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 children , Jack, Murphy, Mave and Mary that this City is worth fighting for. Public service being involved in the community in any way is important . And I truly believe and I said this before that it is an obligation that we all have and it's in our blood. It's not easy. It's not for the faint of heart but nothing worth having as we all know comes easy. Now, when my ancestors left County Mayo, Ireland and stepped foot in this City like many of your ancestors did, they built this city from the ground up with hard work and a belief that we could always do better. And I will always believe that our best days here in Scranton are ahead of us. And I look forward to continuing to be involve d in public service in some way in the future. And again, I want to thank all of you for all of your support . It's been an absolute honor and a privilege to work on your behalf. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. No business at this time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. READING BY TITLE -- FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 106, 2021 - AN ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING THE NAMING OF A NEW POCKET PARK LOCATED AT 248 WYOMING AVENUE IN HONOR OF FORMER MAYOR CHRISTOPHER A. DOHERTY . MR. GAUGHAN : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , contrary to some speakers tonight I have received many phone calls and messages in support of this measure from people who recognize the impact that Mayor Doherty has had on our City, especially our park system and our downtown . As I mentioned last week, since 1866 the City's incorporation , we've had dozens and dozens of mayors. And each one of them good or bad made their impact on the City. No matter what you think about Chris Doherty , positive or negative , there is no doubt, no doubt that he had made his mark on this City in terms of a lot of things but especially our park system 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 and our downtown . I have four little children . When you want to move into a City, you look at a few things, one of them being a park system. I lived across the street from a park for seven years. And when that park was rehabbed , boy, did it make a difference in our neighborhood . I started to see people that I did not see before who were coming to enjoy the City of Scranton . So, yes, it does matter. Each mayor makes an impact, each Council member in some form or fashion whether you like them or don't like them, they make an impact. Chris Doherty had an enormous , enormous impact in our City in terms of the parks and the downtown . So for those reasons I am going to support this. I did support this last week. It's a good thing for the City of Scranton . And when you have a very positive effect on your community , you just deserve to be honored . There have been many mayors in past in the City who have been honored with a park, naming a park after them and other things. This one, Mayor Doherty deserves it. Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to suspend the rules to move Item 6-A to Seventh Order for a final vote. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 105, 2021 AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 72, 2019, AN ORDINANCE AMENDING FILE OF COUNCIL NO. 64 OF 2014 ENTITLED “AN ORDINANCE ADOPTING THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND VIOLATIONS TICKET PROCESS IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON (AS AMENDED )” TO AMEND VIOLATIONS IN SECTION 2; ENFORCEMENT IN SECTION 4; FINES AND PENALTIES IN SECTION 5; FINES AND PENALTIES IN SECTION 6; AND CITATION FINES IN SECTION 7. MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage Item 7-F. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question . Go ahead. DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I have a few points that I'd like to make about this legislation . Our City has a problem with blight. It's something that I noticed for a long time. And it's one of the reasons that I wanted to run for Council in the first place to help us fight blight. We, you know, I think that we have an amazing City. I love it. I love living here. And I want other people to do the same and to be proud of their City. And I think in order to do that, you need to -- we need to help correct our appearance . We need to address the issues with landlords and homeowners who do not care about their properties or their rentals , people who live out of town or out of state and, you know, just don't keep up with their properties . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 that's why we have a quality of life ordinance to help to address those issues. And we know that it has not been working . And I feel that since I've been on Council I've been working along side of OECD and our LIPS Department so that we can help to correct that process . And I think that there is still certainly is work to be done. This is one of the things to come out of those conversations is this piece of legislation . I think that it was a mistake when the fines were lowered before my time on Council . And you could see on the website it's actually on the home page there is a quality of life workflow that they have posted now. And to my knowledge , they've been adhering to that workflow. Once a complaint is received , it then gets forward ed to the Code Enforcement supervisor . And then it's assigned to a housing inspector . The housing inspector will then take a look at the property , see if the complaint is valid. And they will take photos and leave a door tag if the complaint is valid. Also, now with the addition of OpenGov , there have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 been a lot of improvement s. And this information is being entered into OpenGov . And it's a lot easier for them to track. Then within one to three days, the housing inspector will recheck the property . If it's not resolved , if the person hasn't, you know, say cut the grass, if that was the issue, then they'll send a certified violation letter to the owner. So this is two chances , two opportunities that they have to correct the issue. Then the housing inspect or will recheck the property . If it's not resolved , they'll issue the ticket. Current ly it's at $25. Then it could be escalated to $50. And that's within seven days of the previous step. And within 10 days the housing inspector will once again go out to see if it has been resolved . If not, they could file a citation with the magistrate which could be up to a thousand dollar fine. The magistrate sometimes were even getting stuck with these. So once people still have not paid the fines, then getting a hearing and, you know, getting the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 person there, that's been part of the issue. But I, you know, I don't think that it's been any more improved in terms of getting people to pay the fines. And it's not so that we could make money off of -- off of the residents so that people could be more compliant and take us seriously in getting issues resolve d. And I don't feel that that has changed . And I feel that it's been long enough, the two years since that had been passed and the fine was lowered . So this ordinance here will increase it to a hundred dollars . And then there will be late fees, 10 percent in addition to that cost for every week that it's late up to 10 weeks. And I think that we need to hold people accountable . And if there is an issue with addressing the problem that, you know, say the resident or homeowner is having, then I think there's room for that discussion with the City and we could work from there. And if not -- and then if we repeatedly get ignored and it doesn't get resolved , then that's when these next steps 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 need to be taken. And I did just want to provide as a resource to -- and this was something that was started this year that NeighborWorks had started this mobile tool kit. So this is something if there is like a neighborhood cleanup or a project or if you need supplies to get something done that you could contact NeighborWorks . And they can set up a date to bring this mobile tool kit near a property and then you could utilize it. So there's a lot of different tools. There's, you know, there's lawnmowers, there's shovels . They have done that over the fall time. And then I think they're taking reservations for February , 2022. So I just want to make sure the public was aware of that. And I believe that's -- that's all that I have on this. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question real quick, so it seems to me that it doesn't matter whether -- what the fines are. We're still having the issue of it getting thrown out -- those issues getting thrown out at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 magistrate level. So realistically it all comes down to documenting what you're putting out there because if you are not documenting it and you're not building a case, by the time you get to the magistrate , they are just going to throw it out anyway. So to me it doesn't really matter what the fines are. It's about compliance and deterrence . And I think a higher fine is a greater deterrence . So I will be voting for this. But that doesn't mean I don't think that, you know, the previous administration -- I think it was under Wayne Evans when we got the legislation dropping the fines. That doesn't mean that they were wrong. That doesn't mean that -- we have to get the process right at the beginning and documenting it and tracking that workflow. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, on the question , so it seems there's been improvements that have been made to the department whether it be workflow , whether it be the addition of OpenGov ; and the one thing I think is really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 going to help is the addition of the solicitor that's going to be in that department now. In 2019 there were issues that were going on and Council decided to lower that fee for the reasons that were occurring at the time. And at this time I don't know if the answer is to increase the punishment on the resident . I do think the workflow, the website of OpenGov and also the solicitor will help with the enforce ment of this. It's basically what I heard from the residents when I speak to them when they call me with a complaint . And this process occurs when those things are occurring , the problem is usually taken care of. When that process breaks down is normally when I get the call back that nothing is occurring and nothing is happening . I'm a person that likes to systematically go through things. I do think with these changes that have already occurred going into next year, I think we're going to see some more help with this. But I'll be voting no on this just due to the fact that we're increasing the fines. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, so I think it's premature . So whenever you make change or implement something new, you should take a three-year analysis , not two. Three is always a better number. And also I liked to see in the third year the impact of OpenGov , which is a great tool. I'm thrilled to have it. And I'd also like to see the impact of a solicitor dedicate d to code enforce ment. I'd like to see this process evolve one more year before raising the fees so that is why I'll be voting no. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR.

MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-G. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , there always seems to be some unfounded criticism out there that the City only concentrates on the downtown and neglects its neighborhoods . I think this legislation is another example of the City's commitment into our neighborhoods . I had the pleasure of serving on the steering committee for this neighborhood plan 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 along side with representative s from Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine , Lackawanna College , NeighborWorks , United Neighborhood Centers , the PA Department of Community and Economic Development , the Lackawanna River Conservation Authority , the Chamber of Commerce as well as residents and business owners from the Pine Brook neighborhood . This steering committee was organized back in the fall of 2019. We worked through COVID and dealt with those issues. And that was harder when we were going out trying to collect data from the neighborhood . But it's a great example of a public-private partnership that looked at an underutilize d section of our city and put together a plan to build this neighborhood back up to what it once was, which is a vibrant mixed use neighborhood that include s residential and commercial corridors as well as future plans for now for investments into the recreation al areas that Pine Brook has to offer such as Sweeney Beach, Chick Feldman Field and the Penn Ridge Complex . And I just think it's a good program for that neighborhood . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree. I'm happy to see what's been happening over in the Pine Brook neighborhood . I think there's a lot of improvement s that are being made. I was happy to see the school being taken down just a few weeks ago. And I'm sure that something great will be put in its place. But, yeah, so I will be voting yes for this. I think it would be great to get the Keystone , Elm Street designation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS.

MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-N. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I'm not going to rehash my comments from a couple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 of weeks ago regarding the school district 's unwilling ness to make this change at this time. But I do want to reiterate my position that I do not believe this is a perfect option, but it is the only option we have at the moment. The City's point of view, we either make this conversion now or we lose the ability to do so in January when we exit Act 47. And then although I prefer for the school district to make this conversion along with us, especially for the sake of the business community who will now have to pay two separate taxes, I still believe it is in the best interest of the City residents and taxpayer s that we move forward with this conversion on our own. Hopefully the new School Board will come to their senses. And I think I just saw in the Times the state is providing them the gap funding that they were worried about that 1.2 million dollars . But hopefully they come to their senses and make this conversion either an amended budget for 2022 or in their 2023 budget, which they will still have the ability to do moving forward even though the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 looses its ability to change. But basically I support this conversion because the Business Privilege and Mercantile Taxes have been labeled as the nuisance taxes by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania since the late 80s and can't even be levied any longer. There is very limited organic growth in either Business Privilege or Mercantile and neither is easily collectable on top of being a burden on our small business community . Payroll Prep Tax is a more modern easily collect ible tax. It has great potential for organic growth as wages increase. It's easier to verify what is owed. And it's spread out to cover all businesses in the City. And it has to be revenue neutral in year one and the City also has the ability to readjust the rate after year one to guarantee that it is revenue neutral . So for those reasons, I will be supporting this legislation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? On the question , I'm going to be voting for this as well. Obviously nobody likes any tax. But if there is one theme that I've heard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 since I've on been on Council , everyone unanimously hates the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax, all of our small businesses , never heard one small business person in favor of it. As Councilman Donahue said, I also believe that this will -- tax will improve collectability , has the potential to broaden the tax base and promote the general fairness in taxation . Over the 70 percent of the people voted for it when it went to referendum . So I think it's a no-brainer . Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS.

MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-O. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I'd like to thank Solicitor Hayes for hammering out the details with regards to the concerns we had with this initial contract . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? On the question , I'm going to be voting for this. And let me explain why, a few reasons . First of all, right now as it stands there is no director in the IT Department . Any entity that I've seen anywhere with over 500 employees at this point has some third party company helping them run their operation s.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 What concerns me is if we don't do this is, we have a police department and a fire department that rely heavily today on technology . Obviously we do not have the wherewithal now to do this on our own, especially with the fact that we don't have a director and the person that Mayor put in there in my opinion is not qualified , doesn't -- no background in information technology . So while I don't generally like hiring consulting firms and consulting services , this I think is needed. Otherwise , we'll be looking at a potential disaster moving forward because of the way that this whole thing has been handled. Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR.

DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : How about a hand for Councilman Donahue ? How about that? I don't know how he got stuck with this job for the second year in a row. So I don't know how that happened . Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Thank you, Councilman Donahue . And I heard a second, right? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. Second. MR. GAUGHAN : All those in favor of the amendment signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. What is the recommendation of Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of 7-P as amended . MR. MCANDREW : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25101 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Someone want to go first? MR. MCANDREW : I'll go first. On the question , I'm very proud of the work that Council and especially President Gaughan and Vice President Donahue put into this. I agree with all the amendment s. I know the biggest point of -- first of all, the 3 percent increase across the board is fair. All right. It's a compromise . This budget is a compromise . So that's fair. So the other exorbitant raises I was totally against . But I'm going to be short and brief. So I know the biggest point of contention between yesterday 's article and today's is the finance -- financial direct -- Director of Finance . And I'm going to tell you why I was not in favor of it. And so I listened to you guys and your points are valid. But, you know, PEL's plan was to exit Act 47 and the reins over to a competent experienced business -- a BA and his staff. So with that said, you know, we didn't hear a peep out of them recommending a Director 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25102 of Finance until last week. All right. So -- and I want to put this into perspective . Over at the school district they are in recovery , same thing as distressed status, same thing, different entity. They have a plan. It's a five-year plan. Dr. Finan is the Chief Recovery Officer , the equivalent of PEL. So at the end of five years with, you know, hopefully solvency , they're not going to recommend to hire somebody to replace her when she leaves. She's going to hand the reins over. And I think PEL should have done the same thing here. So that's my rational e. I appreciated yours. And that is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : So to go off of Mark here, you know, the biggest point of contention is this position of the Director of Finance . When I look at BA's office, we have the Business Administrator . We have the Finance Manager . We have staff accountant , special assistant and a financial analyst. Some of the concerns I raised months 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25103 ago when looking at this position are the same exact things that are occurring right now and through this budget process . I raised those concerns then. And I think if we're going to fully utilize these people in this office, the staff is there to do it. We just have to get to work in that office. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , first I'd like to say that I appreciate the work that I felt Council members , especially Councilman Gaughan and Councilman Donahue have done on this budget and the amendments , all the time spent over spreadsheets, making sure that every number is correct . It's incredibly tedious work. And we know that this process has been messy and has not gone the way that we've wanted it to as has been reiterated several times. But, you know, ultimately this budget is sound and balanced . And I'm voting for it as a whole. And I'm happy to see that we've increased some raises to the positions , the 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25104 percent for many nonunion positions , but then also some of the market based increases to department heads. We know that our salaries are far behind many of the other cities in our state that of our size. And so I do believe that we need to work on catching up. And with regards to the Director of Finance position , that is something that I would have liked to have kept in there. You know, I am I wouldn't say nervous coming out of distressed status, but still we're not where we want to be just yet or to the point where we don't need to be under Act 47 anymore. But's as a city, we still have a lot of work to do. And I felt that that position would give us the extra bandwidth to be able to do that. So I am disappointed that that is not in our amended budget. But I think that there are some options in the future as I've heard that we could possibly fund that position . So I'll look forward to possibly that. And I will be voting for this budget tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25105 MR. DONAHUE : So given all the amendments I just had to read, I don't think I need to harp on this year's budget process because we all know we have to do better moving forward . And we will be having discussions with the administration beginning in the new year about how to improve this process so we don't run into the same issues that we dealt with both this year and last. In terms of what's in front of us at the moment, I think it's safe to say that neither myself, my fellow colleagues or the administration are 100 percent happy with this budget in its entirety . But that's how compromise works. No one gets all of that they want. And there has to be some give and take. And that's exactly what this budget is I believe . It's a compromise budget. Personally I would have liked to see the Director of Finance position be included in this budget. I would have liked to see more resources included that allow the City to better monitor pave cuts and quality of life issues. But given the fact that there's four 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25106 separate contracts expiring at the end of this year that are still not resolved , questions surrounding the delinquent real estate tax collection number and the desire by both Council and the administration to keep tax rates steady, this budget basically comes down to a product of what we need to continue to provide essential services . We'll be getting though the City government on a more positive direction by modernizing city government operations . So I'll be voting for this budget because I do believe it is a small step in the right direction . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Before I give my comment s on the budget, I just -- everyone here had to painful ly sit through the reading of 95 amendments . I just want to make one point clear. This is not normal by any stretch of the imagination no matter what the Mayor says, no matter what the Business Administrator says. This year and last year were the most abnormal years in terms of a budget process that I've ever seen in eight years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25107 since I've been on Council . So I just want to make sure that the public understand s that. This isn't like the administration said, hey, let's get together and let's change the budget and let's all kumbaya . This was a disaster of epic proportion . I've never seen anything like it. And I know I said that before in the last few weeks, but I want to make sure that the public understand s that because it was such a disaster . It was such a mess. And as you sat here through those 95 amendments that Councilman Donahue had to make, I hope everyone understands that in a normal year there is never going to be 95 amendments to the budget, not even close, not even close. Now the job of City Council in my view is one of a watchdog. We represent the people. We represent you and your hard earned tax dollars. And we ensure that those funds are spent properly and they are spent wisely. This year I'm proud to say that this Council did its job on behalf of the people of our city. When we were faced with a budget present ed by the Mayor and the Business 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25108 Administrator for the second year in a row that was littered with errors, inaccuracies and omissions , we stepped up. We identified the mistakes and we fixed them. As I stated here numerous times the past few weeks, the budget process , the Mayor and Business Administrator have employed not just this year but also last year has left an awful lot to be desired . It was sloppy. And it was careless as evidenced by the 95 amendments that we had to make. Now I say this not to belabor the point, not to continue to needle the administration over their clear incompetence in this matter or to be negative but to tell the truth, which is what I was elected to do. And it's what I've have done for the last eight years. If I didn't point these things out and if we didn't make this public, then how would any of you know what was going on? These are your tax dollars . You should know what goes on in this building . How would this process and future budgets get any better? Now, last year if you remember , I sat here or actually we were at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25109 that point we were on Zoom because of the pandemic . And I made several suggestions and warnings that the process was not being followed the way that most Council people are used to. Obviously they went completely unheeded, which left me with no other choice than to this year say almost the exact same thing, except this year maybe a little bit more forcefully . I won't be here next year obviously . I stated that before. But for the love of God, make sure the numbers are correct . And this nonsense that is coming out of the administration that, oh, there was some columns that didn't transfer over and there were some numbers that didn't add up and we recalculated projections , that is garbage . That is garbage . If they had just taken responsibility for it from the beginning , I might have given them a little bit more credit. But the memo that was issued and this narrative that's coming out that's trying to spin this thing as if it's some kind of normal every day occurrence is very, very frustrating .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25110 Now, even though I'm confident in the budget that we will vote on tonight , I still have some concerns that I'll get to in a minute. The budget that we presented though tonight did a few things. It eliminated unnecessary and in some cases redundant positions . It scaled back gigantic increases for employee s to a more manageable level which was a theme last year and the Mayor apparently did not get the memo. And we tried to make revenue protections as conservative as we could in the face of conflicting information . The budget the Mayor originally propose d and the one we will vote on tonight has been decreased by nearly a million dollars with the decreases in salaries , the elimination of position s and other moves that we made here tonight , we saved almost half a million dollars . Now this is important because we should be running our city like all of you run your households watching every penny, saving where we can and not spending unnecessarily where there will be no added value or benefit . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25111 Now one of the concerns has been raised tonight and that I read about in the newspaper is this addition of the Director of Finance , which to be quite honest with all of you, has me completely puzzled. The Mayor's comment s in the newspaper today regarding this position of Finance Director where she stated that she was disappointed Council cut the position , called it extremely important given our impending exit from State Act 47 oversight , and she also stated that if we don't reverse course, she will try to secure private funding for a finance director arguing it's a position we just simply have to have. Well, let's take a look actually at the facts. First of all, we do not need this position , which is why it is eliminated from this budget. The Director of Finance is the Business Administrator . That is why we have a Business Administrator . That is his job. By the way, as Councilman Schuster pointed out, we also have a finance manager who has the title of Assistant BA. We have staff account ants. We have other employees in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25112 BA's department . We create a finance director position , people in that office are going to be tripping over each other. That would be like if I propose in this budget creating a Director of Council even though we have a City Clerk. What would the City Clerk do? They are both doing the same position . It does not make any sense. Before we start adding positions -- and this position would have paid $80,000, let's make sure we have people in these position s that are already qualified and know how to do the job. And I have to be completely honest. After going through this process , I have concerns that the Business Administrator is not qualified for the position that he is in. And one of the hallmarks of leadership is to admit when you're wrong. A few months ago I sat up here and listened to Councilman Schuster and Councilman McAndrew state very eloquently that they were -- they voted against Mr. West because they stated that they were concerned about his qualifications . I gave the Mayor the benefit of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25113 doubt then because the Mayor should have the ability to fill her staff with people who she sees fit. I made a mistake . After going through this budget it's clear that we need a new Business Administrator that has a financial background . The position is just too important , just too important . So I do think moving forward next year the Mayor needs to make a change there. Otherwise , we may run the risk of running into this problem next year. And the Director of Finance position is redundant . We do not need it. I'm also very concerned that the Mayor stated in the newspaper that she would secure private funding for the finance director position . This is a complete -- she's completely trying to circumvent again, Council 's role. So you don't -- we clearly do not want this position -- a majority of us do not want this position in the budget. So the Mayor's answer is, well, I'm going to go to outside private donors to fund it. That is complete nonsense . Who will this person then answer to, private donors or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25114 Council and the public through your tax dollars ? I would not be in favor of that. And I do think that it's something that next year's Council will have to watch very closely . We saw the same thing -- there's a pattern here, the same thing that the mayor did in the IT Department . We clearly -- five of us voted against Mr. Deeley to be the IT Director . What did the Mayor do? She put him in that office anyways. And I believe that is one of the reasons we have to hire an outside consulting firm to make sure that department is run correctly because Mr. Deeley is not qualified -- he was not qualified to be the IT Director . So these are crucial positions . We need to make sure -- the Mayor needs to make sure that we are putting qualified people in there, okay? Mr. West seems like a nice enough guy. But he's as qualified to be the Business Administrator as I am to be an astronaut and fly a spaceship to the moon. It doesn't add up.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25115 And again, I don't say that lightly . I literal ly witnessed mistake after mistake after mistake after mistake , 95 correction s to a budget where, I mean, if you look, we have a lot of budgets to look back at. It's not like we were recreating the wheel here and this was all being made up on the fly. So that's my concern . And I need to state it here because I'm afraid that if we don't, it's going to happen again next year, maybe not to this extent because we've raised the red flag and sounded the alarm for the second year in a row. Something 's got to give here. And this nonsense that PEL also recommends the position , well, that's nice. PEL has recommended a lot of things in the past like going to the State Supreme Court against the unions. How did that end up? We had a 30 million dollar judgment . So let's hire qualified people. Let's make sure they do their job. And we should be okay. We do not need new positions if we do -- where we do not hire qualified people to make up for that. It does not make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25116 any sense. Overall though, I'm pleased that we're able to present this budget to the public. It doesn't raise taxes. It's financial ly sound and balance d. It eliminate s unnecessary positions , scales back major pay raises and provides more help in our park system and our DPW. Thank you.
