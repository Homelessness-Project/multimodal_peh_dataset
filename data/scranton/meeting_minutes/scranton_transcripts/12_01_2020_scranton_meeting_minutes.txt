This is the road maintenance agreement between the City and Lackawanna County for maintenance of the 300 block of Center Street. On the question? All those in favor signify by saying. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mrs. Reed, please dispense with the reading of the minutes . MS. REED: THIRD ORDER. 3-A. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM DPW DIRECTOR DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2020 REGARDING RESOLUTION NO. 49, 2020 EQUIPMENT TO THE CITY FROM KEYSTONE SANITARY LANDFILL . 3-B. LACKAWANNA COUNTY COURT OF COMMON PLEAS ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 5, 2020 REGARDING CITY OF SCRANTON REQUEST TO INCREASE LOCAL SERVICES TAX FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020. 3-C. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM OECD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DATED NOVEMBER 24, 2020 REGARDING COVID-19 REIMBURSEMENTS THROUGH LACKAWANNA COUNTY CARES ACT FUNDING . MR. GAUGHAN : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? I have one. I did have a question on 3-C, which is the COVID-19 reimbursement s through the Lackawanna County CARES Act funding . I did reach out to the OECD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Director , Eileen Cipriani . I said that I was reading through the November 24th memo that's on our agenda. And in that memo it stated that the City receive d the reimburse ment from the County in the amount of $326,203.37. And it is thought that amount covers invoices submitted through the first week of December . I was confused with how this process was working . So I asked the county review each invoice and inform the City as to what expenses were approve d and what were not approved. Director Cipriani said the following , the attached -- she attached documents which we'll -- I'll share with Council and we'll put in Third Order for next week. The attached is what we received explaining the payment of $326,203.37. Eileen Cipriani has asked for a breakdown of what was excluded . But she's not received it as of this time. She said by comparing the vendors they listed, she was able to determine that the county did not fund the Serrenti building cost as well as a message board the police purchased and $18,000 in IT costs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 And there was a few other expense s that were excluded as well. The county did tell the City that they're eligible for $500,000 total in reimbursement . And she attached a spreadsheet of all of the City's submissions and the latest memo that's coming to Council that will be in Third Order for next week. And she also noted that it's important that they find out what the county did not reimburse the City for because the City can then reimburse -- submit those costs rather to FEMA for reimbursement . So will I be waiting for the explanation and the breakdown on that because I think that's important to know. Anyone else on the Third Order item? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I just have a couple. Just a reminder that garbage pickup is on schedule this week and that it is the blue containers . Next week, the week of December 7th is the last week for the fall leaf pickup and Recycling Program . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Just a reminder that leaves must be placed in biodegradable brown paper bags. All collections will be from the curbside of streets and avenues, no collection s in courts or alleys, no loose piles, no plastic bags, no household trash in leaf bags. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have one. Christmas came early this year to the McAndrew house -- actually three weeks early. My beautiful daughter Moriah and her husband Nick had a beautiful baby boy today. His name is Cillian Andrew Kich, so first grandchild , very excited here. MR. DONAHUE : Congratulations , Mark. DR. ROTHCHILD : Congratulations . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Congratulations . Very good news. That's great. Everybody is healthy ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, beautiful . Everybody 's great. MR. GAUGHAN : Good. Good news. Very good. And Cillian , that's not Irish, is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 it? MR. MCANDREW : You know, it is. MR. GAUGHAN : I figured , westsider, Irish, has to be. Anyone else? We can't top that one. DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I can't. Mine is a little more -- I don't know, depressing maybe. But I just -- I wanted to mention I know in the past I mentioned Lexi Caviston . She passed over the summertime. She was a 23-year-old woman battling brain cancer. And, you know, I was happy to see from her husband and her family members that a few days ago they had decorated her grave for Christmas with some Christmas decorations . And I thought that was really neat. And unfortunately , I think it was only maybe a day or so later, those decorations were stolen from the gravesite. And I just think that's a terrible thing for anyone to do. So I know that, you know, like the Scranton Times and the police I think have picked up on it because they're looking for whoever might have stolen the decorations . So if people look at the story and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 like the picture , I know there's like the grinch and a couple other things on there so they could take a look and see if, perhaps , they see them anywhere or have any information on who might have stolen that from the gravesite. And that was from Cathedral cemetery in West Scranton . MR. DONAHUE : And that -- and that wasn't the only one. There were a couple other graves where decorations were also stolen over at the Cathedral in the last few days too. DR. ROTHCHILD : Right. Yes, I think the Dougher family as well, Dougher family, so, yeah, it's -- it's a terrible thing people just trying to remember their loved ones and to have things stolen from their gravesites. So if anyone has any information on that, make sure you contact the Scranton Police. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just have one. I wanted to mention the retirement of Eileen Hurchick . Eileen Hurchick is a member of the clerical union in the City. She's been employed by the City for 31 years. And I just wanted to wish her a happy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 retirement . I worked with Eileen a few years ago and -- quite a few years ago. And she was a great employee of the City, dedicated individual and a really kind and caring person. So I just want to wish her the best and wish her family the best and a good, happy and healthy retirement . And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time, would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Patricia Nestor and Marie Schumacher . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record at this time? MS. REED: Yes, thank you. The first submission is from Patricia Nestor as follows :1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 I have lived on the 900 block of Green Ridge Street for over 40 years. The Meadowbrook Creek runs under 920 Green Ridge Street at the abandoned store. Every year when the weather turns cold, the rats come up from below and seek warmth. Two years ago a rat came up my toilet and my husband had to “take care of it.”. I want to make you aware that the rats on the 900 block Green Ridge Street are very active this year. My tenant hasn’t had any in her house but she said she has seen BIG ONES running on the sidewalk across the street. Yesterday a lady was walking her dog while I was outside and I heard her scream, “Ugh! A rat!”. I don’t know what you can do about it. I bought all of my tenants new garbage cans with secure lids so they wouldn’t be attracted to the cans. I just thought you should be aware and maybe have ideas to help. MS. REED: The second submission is from Marie Schumacher as follows :1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 O 6A - I thought the approved 2020 Operating Budget called for selling the delinquencies outright but it now appears that is not the case. Also the amount seems puny considering the number and dollar value of these delinquencies . O Considering the drop in gasoline pumping tells me many people were misusing the cards so now I wonder what the Employee Audit has turned up regarding unpaid taxes and fees by City employees . Taxpayers need to know. O Concerning unanswered questions , it has been 8 weeks since I noted a large orange sign stating "NO TRUCKS" had appeared on a utility pole at Prospect and River Streets . I asked whether it is only for the 600 block of River Street or all of River Street and how are these signs obtained . What makes this too difficult to answer for two months and counting ? O Also still waiting to hear if former Police Chief Graziano established a prearrest drug treatment program . O Considering universities utilization of virtual classes , is anyone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 looking ahead to how these changes will impact the City should they continue to determine what action, if any might be taken?. O It's been a long time since the City Council /School Board shared service committee has provided a report. When shall we expect an update?. O Please provide the heating and air-conditioning utility expenses for 2019 and 2020 to date for the former Serrenti Building . o If City Hall was inspected by a City Housing Inspector would it pass? O Please request how future employees will pay for their employment in cost savings or increased revenue . (This concludes public comment as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , just on Miss Schumacher 's question about the shared services committee , there is a meeting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 scheduled for next week. And I believe the main topic of discussion is going to be a HUP test. I'm sure Miss Schumacher will be thrilled about that. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Yeah, two comments ; number one, I already answered -- I believe I answered two of these questions on the large orange signs stating no trucks. I'll go back and look. If I didn't, I apologize . But I know I'm almost positive I brought that up before. And the prearrest drug treatment program , not only did I answer that question , but I also put the whole program , the documentation in Third Order for everyone to take a look at. So that question has been answered . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have comments . In caucus I brought up three question s that I posed two weeks ago at the work session -- the budget work session . And then Mrs. Reed actually sent these three questions to administration , Mr. Deeley and the Mayor. And I'm patiently awaiting the answers . Mr. Deeley said in caucus that I would receive them tonight . One being total comprehension for the proposed 12 new positions also including the amount for the parity increases for some employees . The second question was, I just want to know who's exempt and who's not exempt from overtime -- not hourly employees , I'm talking about management positions . I haven't got a clear understanding or an answer about because I'm hearing there's a lot of overtime being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 accumulated . And the final one was with the new fleet manager, who is actually preparing or collect ing or gathering the data for the fuel card usage. My understanding that that was one of the reasons why this gentleman was hired. And it wasn't reflected in the article in the Times which would be two weeks ago about who's handling the data. So I'm patient awaiting the answers to these questions . That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, none at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And, Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : The only thing I have is to make a motion to table Item 7-B just to get some further information . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion to table agenda Item 7-B. Is there a second? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Second. On the question ? And, Kyle, do you -- MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, we just want to table this just to make sure we cover all ends and do our due diligence in terms of the refuse litigation . And Solicitor Hayes set up a call tomorrow with Attorney Price to go over some of -- just some of those questions . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion to table agenda Item 7-B signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. DONAHUE : And that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Very good. Thank you. The one thing I wanted to mention was, again, I talked about this in caucus was about Nay Aug Park. So I did receive a few calls based on the comment s that were made last week about people who were concerned that the pool was not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 going to be open for next year. So I did speak to the Mayor. She's going to respond to our correspondence and our questions and hopefully we can get that resolved . As I mentioned , it was my understanding that there was money put aside in the budget for Nay Aug pool to fix the liner, to make sure that it's ready and operable for next year. So we asked for a full report on the pool and to give us an understanding of exactly what has to be done. And if they are in need of funding if we put it off this year, the pool's not going to be open next year and eventual ly it's going to have to be address ed. So I think it should be done sooner rather than later. The only other thing I have is I -- just like everyone else, I'm really disturbed and concern ed about the rise in coronavirus cases locally . And more concerning is the numbers that we're receiving in the increase in hospitalizations just within the last month is very, very disturbing and very distressing . And, you know, I know this doesn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 have much to do with City Council , but I just want to make sure this is on the record that I cannot for the life of me understand the incompetence and the lack of really any sort of discern able plan from the federal government . Just as a human being, I just -- I don't understand how since the very beginning everything is just been thrown on the states and the counties and the local government to deal with this. And if anybody is paying attention , our hospital s are in -- not only locally I think we're holding steady for now. But across the country it is devastating what's going on here. And it just seems like not many people in the federal government are listening or maybe caring. I don't know. It's really -- it's so disturbing to me. And my concern is locally that obviously we just had Thanksgiving . And we could be headed towards a real disaster here as we look towards Christmas in terms of the major increase in hospitalization . So I'm hoping that that doesn't happen but all the data points to that happening . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 So I would just urge people to stay home, if you can. Wear a mask, and just be as safe and careful as you can because this is not getting better any time soon. That's all I have. Thank you. Mrs. Reed? Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Reed. Sorry, before you go, I wanted to mention about this -- I know I brought this up before. I think I even sent an e-mail to Miss Schumacher . The large orange sign, that is not the City's. It could be a contractor that's working in the area. The no truck traffic sign was one that was replaced that was there for years and it was just faded. And I think I did address this weeks ago. Sorry, go ahead, Mrs. Reed. MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.

READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 37, 2020 – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT FOR COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT MUNICIPAL CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON WITH PORTNOFF LAW ASSOCIATES , LTD. AND APPROVING COLLECTION PROCEDURES , APPOINTMENT OF SOLICITOR , INTEREST ASSESSMENT , CREDIT CARD AND DEBIT CARD CHARGES , AND FEES AND COSTS TO BE ADDED TO THE AMOUNT COLLECTED AS PART OF UNPAID MUNICIPAL CLAIMS FOR DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. GAUGHAN : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? MR. DONAHUE : I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'd like to make a motion to table this item. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, I'm sorry, Councilman Donahue is going to make a motion to table after the -- we pass it into Seventh Order. MR. SCHUSTER : I got ya. I thought you guys missed it there. MR. GAUGHAN : No, that's okay. Anyone else on the question ? I have a few things. Number one, we will make a motion to table in a second and that really is because we did not receive the disclosure forms that would include the campaign contributions . Usually when we receive a -- legislation like this, we receive the full RFP. We receive the bidders -- all the bidders forms including disclosure s and the whole bid package . And we didn't receive that with this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 legislation . And as last I looked earlier today, we did not receive any of the disclosure forms yet. And even if we did, we wouldn't have enough time to review that. So that's one reason that we'll end up tabling it. We do have them coming in next Tuesday , December 8th, Portnoff , for a caucus to discuss their business model and to discuss the agreement . There's a few things that stuck out to me, one of which was the term in the agreement . It reoccurs automatically unless either party notifies one another with -- I think within 90 days. I think we should look at -- I don't like that language in there. I think that should come out and just make the agreement end and it'd have to come back up for discussion before Council rather than automatically renew with the 90 days. That was one thing. There's a couple other questions that I'll save for next week on the specifics within the agreement . The one item that I talked about in the caucus that I think the administration should seriously consider and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 that I would definitely recommend because I think it's a great idea and I've been saying this now for quite some time is an amnesty period for people. There are -- there's a lot of money outstanding in delinquencies in the City from 2002 to 2020. It's been proven in the past that it's very hard to get blood from a stone. We're in the middle of a pandemic . People are hurting financially and to think that we're going to hire a company to aggressively go after people who owe garbage fees and the garbage bill and then all the fees that are added on top of that I just think at this point is unrealistic . I think a common sense approach would be to offer a period of amnesty for people to waive the fees that have been put on top of the original face value of the garbage bill and have -- give people a chance to come in and pay what they actually owe to the City and get on a payment plan. And then after that period, then you would aggressively try to recoup that money. I don't know that an amnesty program has ever 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 been instituted in the City. I would think that the smart way to go about this would be a one-time amnesty , one time deal. This is it, only time it's ever going to happen and allow people to come forward and to pay those past delinquent garbage fees. One of the biggest -- the other big benefits I see to this is the opportunity for the City to get a -- hopefully a big influx of revenue in the beginning of next year in the first or second quarter . I did talk to the Mayor earlier today about this. And she was open to taking a look at it and analyzing it. I just think it's -- it makes a lot of sense. I looked at York, the City of York in Pennsylvania recently did it. And they were able -- they actually had people lining up out the door once it was announced to come in and get on a payment plan or to pay off the delinquency . I don't think it makes sense to have these people who owe this money to go after them and add on the list of fees that we have in front of us, fee upon fee upon fee upon fee. If you can't pay $300, what makes anyone think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 someone is going to be able to pay $2,000? It just doesn't make sense. So offer an amnesty period for these people. I think it not only benefits -- it not only benefits the people of the City but it also benefits the City. And it will help us next year I think it terms of revenue . So before I were to entertain this, I really would like to hear the Mayor's thoughts on this on whether or not this is going to be done next year. And as I mentioned in caucus, this was something that I pushed for last year. And it was talked about and included as an option in the 2020 budget. So that's all I have. Anyone else? Okay. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. DONAHUE : I'd like to make a motion to table Item 6-A. MR.

Again, this piece of legislation is being tabled for two reasons , one, until the requested documentation including political contribution disclosures have been provided ; and two, a caucus is being held with representative s of the firm which has been scheduled for Tuesday , December 8th, 2020 at 5:45 p.m. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS.
