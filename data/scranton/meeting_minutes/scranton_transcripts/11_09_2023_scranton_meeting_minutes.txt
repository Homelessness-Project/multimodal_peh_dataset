SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 DISTRIBUTED COMPARISON REPORT 2022-2023 RECEIVED NOVEMBER 8, 2023. MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have two quick ones. So tomorrow , Friday, November 10th is Veterans Day. And over at the Victor Alfieri 's they are doing a fantastic thing for our veterans . They're having a free luncheon -- actually dinner I should call it because it's starts at 4:00. It's free to all veterans . And they want to thank everybody for their service . That's fantastic . And then the police department is -- they're going to have their annual toy drive. And please drop of a new unwrapped toy to Scranton Police headquarters , which is on 100 South Washington Avenue by December 11th. Scranton Police Department will be distributing the toys to the children in need in Scranton in time for Christmas . Thank you very much in advance for supporting this very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 worthy cause. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : I think this one was announced maybe last week but the Ukrainian Veterans Club on Railroad Avenue is also having a Veterans Day celebration , Saturday , November 11th. It's going to be from 7 to 10 and they're going to have entertain ment there that night. So that will be their celebration for Veterans Day this weekend . That's all. MR. KING: Any other members ? I'd like to take this time to congratulate Mark McAndrew , Dr. Jessica Rothchild , and Jerry Smurl, congratulate them on their victories the other evening to serve four more years on this Council . It will be a thrill to work with you for the next two years, so congratulations . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN S PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Michael Mancini . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , resident of the City of Scranton . First thing I wanted to talk to you about this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 evening is the election . Congratulations to each of you who ran for reelection and actually won. I want you to reflect on the amount of time you actually spent on this Council and the amount of time that you're going to be spending over the next two or four years and what you envision for the city. Now, what I'd like for you to do is after citizen participation , I wrote a list of things that in my opinion are very important , one of them will be tax increase . Obviously nobody likes to have their taxes increased , my envision of Nay Aug, the sales of the Parking and Sewer Authorities , my take on nonprofits and then also the road and blight. First thing I want to talk about is the tax increase . I sat here prior to this and I heard from several people from the administration . One of the things I heard was $62,000 in overtime for the Parks Department . Now that was in 2022. Project ed for the end of this year was 198,000 in Parks overtime . Now I looked at the project ed for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 next year, you don't even have any projections for that. They also want to open up Weston Field, which is a great idea preCovid. It's one of our jewels here. So, you know, I'd like to see that open. But it has to be budgeted properly so this doesn't happen again. We see a 300 percent increase . Some departments you saw 700 percent . And it's unfair to the citizen s and taxpayer s of the City of Scranton . And that's simply because of mismanagement on the part of the administration . One of the things I didn't see here was for the next year was the Nay Aug Park complex . It was 12 different plans, you know, Fellows Park, Clover Field to name a couple. Nothing there for Nay Aug. All right. That's the crown jewel of the city. And I think it has a lot of historical value. And I truly feel that it needs to be brought back to its historical nature. For somebody to sit here and pat themselves on the back that all parks and pools are open, no they're not. Arrogance becomes your downfall. Arrogance leaving dirt in a pool for four years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 changes the future of our kids. All right. Now, another thing I want to talk to you about is non-profits . In February of this year most of you, probably all of you don't know that a PA hospital revoked property tax elimination is a warning shot to other non-profits , all right. This is March 13th, 2023. Spotlight PA, State College . Commonwealth Court recently revokes southeastern Pennsylvania hospital property tax exemption , denied appeals regarding three others. Decisions that one expert said should serve as a warning shot to non-profits . And here's the reason how it came about. There's five different standards according to the State Supreme Court Code of 1985, advance s as a charitable purpose . I don't see Geisinger really doing that. I don't see Regional doing that. I don't see University of Scranton doing that. Donates , surrenders graciously substantial portion of its services , benefits substantial -- class of person who are legitimate subjects of charity . Relieves the government of some of its -- relieves the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 government of some of its burden, operate s entirely freely from private profit motives . Now, the CEOs of each one of these gets millions and millions of dollars . These things I think are very important . I'd like to have your input after citizens participation as far as road and blight, bring back the public safety director, put code enforcement through a public director. Make it separate , allow them to answer to fire and police, DPW. When you have more eyes on something , more stuff gets accomplish ed. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Mancini . Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . I too want to congratulate everybody that won Tuesday . It was a great day for Democrats , not only here in the city but the whole state of Pennsylvania and other parts of the country . Just one quick remark, last week Channel 16 had a poll or they talked about a poll, said if the election was today Donald 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Trump would beat Joe Biden. But from the looks of what happened on Tuesday , what President Biden said after he saw all the results , he said, you know what, polls don't vote. People vote. I think people sent a message on Tuesday . That's all I have to say on that. Walking around my neighborhood with my dog when the people put the blue recycle cans out and put cans and bottles, I notice a lot of stuff that's in those container s that aren't suppose d to be in there. They put food containers in which you are not suppose d to. They keep bottle caps and lids on the containers . I was thinking when the city sends those cards around every year with the schedule if they could maybe put a reminder on there, like, what people are suppose d to do, don't put food containers and caps on bottles . I just thought that might help because I know it was a couple years ago when the recycle coordinator was here. And she said bottle caps and lids, they jam the machines . And, you know, if they put a lot of them in, it takes time to take all of them off. So if they could send a reminder I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 think it's a good idea. I see we're going have a 3 and a half percent tax hike. I'm not thrilled with that. But we haven't had a tax hike in a few years. I mean, the one year Chris Doherty raised our taxes 58 percent , which is unbelievable . I think every couple years I think we do need a tax hike so you don't have to raise it 58. So I'm not really against that. Bob Bolus and I just questioned the Mayor why the Ukraine and Israeli flags weren't up. And she said, well, they had the Ukraine flag up when the war started . And she said with the Israel flag it's a tough time. It might cause trouble , blah, blah, blah. I said, well, if people want to protest , let them protest . If they get out of control , throw them in jail. She kept saying it's a tough time. It's a tough time. I think it's wrong. And I don't think she's going to put it up. Another thing, she talked about the parks. She said the city owns the parks. Do they own the Tripp Park softball complex ? Does anybody know? Okay, there's a question . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 The people that run the leagues down there, they're locking the gates so nobody else could get in there after the leagues are done. Do they have authority to do that? MR. SCHUSTER : That they may. I'm not really sure. I know down at Sloan they do the same thing. And then people that are taking care of the fields and maintaining the fields have access to the key. So I would imagine that they do. MR. SPINDLER : I know why they're doing it because a lot of people used to walk their dogs there and not clean up after the dogs. And I was one of them and I always cleaned up. I took a shovel with me and I cleaned up after everybody else's dogs. My dog never went in there. My dog goes in my yard. But, you know, I was just curious if they do because , you know, the kids want to go over there and play. If there's no leagues going on, why can't kids go in there and play baseball themselves ? If the city owns it, I don't think they should be able to lock people out. MR. MCANDREW : I think that has to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 do with the lease agreement they were speaking of earlier . You actually , you know, you take ownership of it when you lease it. So I think maybe in regards to liability . I'm not sure. We could get that question clarified . But I'm just thinking out loud with regards to what they said earlier . MR. SPINDLER : Okay. All right. That's all I have tonight. But I think it would be nice if Council talked to the Mayor about putting the Israeli flag up. I don't think it would cause any trouble . If it does, lock the people up that are causing the trouble . Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Lenny Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council , Lenny Srebro, Keyser Valley. Last week we talked about somebody was going to call somebody and get a timeline on that Briggs Street 24 inch pipe. Did anybody get an answer? MR. SCHUSTER : So we just got an answer tonight . We were under the impression when we came down and met, we were under the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 impression that there was a meeting on that Friday. When we got our answer back, there was never a meeting on that Friday with the city. So I'm not really sure where that information came from. But as of tonight and in some of the answers we received , they're going to wait for the -- the city administration said they're going to wait for the plan to roll out before they address that pipe. MR. SREBRO: So it's another waiting game, right? MR. SCHUSTER : That's what it sounds like. MR. SREBRO: Just no answer. MR. MCANDREW : But guess what, they said there's going to be a meeting in the beginning of December that you guys will be informed about to talk about it. MR. SREBRO: Okay. That's another thing I wanted to talk about. Now, Mr. Schuster , you were -- I asked him about wasn't there a meeting , you know, at the Keyser Valley Community Center. Same thing, I didn't know that -- what was going on. Could we just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 make sure that I understand that there is going to be another meeting like that in December to let the neighbors know the progress , what's going on, make sure we know, like, nobody knew about that October -- MR. KING: We specifically asked the Mayor that tonight . We said please let us know the date and let's make sure it's advertised . MR. SREBRO: Okay. MR. SCHUSTER : So just to start off though, the week after the flood I specifically asked the Mayor to start a task force and to reach out to the neighbor s and get some of the neighbor s on that task force. And it was decided to do pop-ups instead . I felt like getting a task force together with the neighbors would have been more beneficial to the neighbors with communication rather than the pop-ups. But they went with the pop-ups. So I'm glad to hear there is a meeting coming in December . I would suggest that it's at the Keyser Valley Community Center and that there be a contact -- MR. SREBRO: Well, you know what, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 that is another thing that I wanted to suggest that maybe we could have a certain person to make the contact with the neighbors and what's going on with the flood protection . Okay, you know, today one of the neighbors there had to call DPW to get the storm drain opened up at his place. You know, we haven't had much rain lately. And for that storm drain, you know, at the corner of his lot to get plugged up again since the cleanup back in September , it kind of tells you something about the drainage system that DPW had to come and flush that out. I don't know where the mud was coming from, but they had to come and take care of it. Okay, I notice they are doing a lot of work in the pump house. Do you know what they are doing there? I did ask one guy going by. He said they're putting in a new control panel, you know, but then I didn't know anything after that. He didn't know what to tell me either. So could we find out what's getting done there with that pump house? MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , if you could reach out to the administration and try 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 to find out exactly what improve ments are being made to that pump house? Appreciate that. MR. SREBRO: Yeah, I know they were in there working and replacing stuff. But I don't know anything after that. That's all I got for tonight . Thanks. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Srebro. Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Congratulations to the winners . Let's see how well we get represented . Any idea how many vacancies there are in the police department ? The budget has city funding for four patrolman positions . We all know it's a lot more than four that we need. The city recently did away with its current testing for the police officers and went with a third party national testing network company in the hopes of getting more applicant s. Do you have a total number of applicants that took the test? Was it explained to the applicant s that the city was only budgeting for four officers before they paid the $55 test fee? There was also a hardship 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 scholarship available that would waive the testing fee. Do you have a total number of scholar ships that were provided ? Do you have any comparison in the number of applicants the old testing attract ed versus the number of applicants the new testing attracted ? Are you aware of any issues with the national testing network test scoring ? In the minutes of the meeting for the Civil Service Commission of August 1st, 2023, there was an issue. It states to progress with the candidate s who scored 70 percent of a weighted score, it is noted that the weighted scores weren't incorporating the written exam. So there was a motion made to schedule a special meeting so that Solicitor Owens could speak with NTN represent atives, inquire what the scores actually mean and how to fix it and report the finding s back to the Commission and back to the Scranton Police Department . So is it fair to assume there is an issue with the new testing company ? Everything the city changes and tries to do is a disaster . Did it affect any of the candidates negatively 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 or positively and what is being done to clarify the issue so it doesn't happen again? Now that the testing for the police department is done by a third-party testing company , will the Civil Service Commission still be overseeing the hiring of the police? Also back in May, one of the board members Miss Garcia announce d that she would be resigning in June. Since that resignation , has the administration filled that board seat? As of last meeting it was still vacant. I filed a right to know regarding city vehicles . During the appeal process the city most recently responded and filed a certified copy that stated: As I conduct ed a thorough examination of files in the possession , custody , and control of the agency for records responsive to the request underlying this appeal, the City of Scranton regarding city vehicles , take-home vehicles , who uses them, and who -- an inventory list of city vehicles . The City of Scranton has no existing records regarding all city-owned vehicles , take-home 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 vehicles by employee s and who the employees are. We don't know who our vehicle -- what vehicles we own. We don't have an inventory list of city vehicles . It is not required by this administration to create a record who does not current ly exist or to compile , maintain , format, or organize a record in a manner in which the agency does not currently compile , maintain format or organize the record of vehicles . This is the city's response to my attorney from the Right to Know Office in Harrisburg . So maybe tonight we should request that the administration compile a list of all vehicles and drivers with their license -- licenses . So if we have no idea of the vehicle s that we own as a city, how are we paying Knowles Insurance ? What are we paying a premium for? If the city doesn't know what they own but Knowles Insurance is insuring city vehicles ? What are we paying for? Did anybody have gas cards? There was an issue in the paper last week where we were looking for tires for city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 vehicles . What city vehicles ? Where are we putting the tires? Maybe it's time we had a list of city vehicles and start running the city like a city. You guys have four more years. Let's see what you can do. We're not going anywhere . We're going to hold your feet to the fire. Have a good night guys and congratulations to the winners . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . Ron Ellman. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , I've also requested a list of city vehicles . And that was not the same answer that we received , right? MR. VOLDENBERG : No. We receive d the answer that it is pending. I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : It's pending . All right. Thank you. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . I don't know if any of you noticed or care, but I've run into a Rolo shortage. It just absolutely -- I can't find them anywhere anymore. Anyway, I've come tonight to complain why this administration deliberate ly conceal ed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 a tax increase of 3.5 after last years' 2 percent . And then in the same article , there's intentions of five new offices and hiring. This is outrageous for the people. You people don't hardly hear the remarks like I do because you're working and I'm wandering around downtown like to Sheetz and the Dollar Store and so on. You know we're -- the school board in the very same article in the paper mentioned up to an 8 percent increase next year. They want to hire new teacher s for kindergarten . I guess this is more important -- kindergarten is more important than people having their homes and families having their homes to this budget, the school board. Then we have a city full of wealthy cheats hiding under the Pure Charity Act. And all we get out of the Mayor, she tells us what she's going to do and doesn't. The last time this was address ed was by Janet Evans. And shameful ly the results were very, very bad. She was told to go to hell by Lackawanna College . And they are one of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 worst -- you remember we gave them money to fix a roof on a building that wasn't even being taxed anymore. That's the kind of government the city has had over and over and over again. Then we got Basalyga in the paper a couple weeks ago he praised how well the complexes , the apartment complex is doing. And then next week he pleads poverty and wants 10 properties off the tax rolls. Last year the Electric City Garage was reduced from 500,000 to 200,000. This -- this is just hypocritical . We got this -- I believe his name is Tobin who works for the county, an assistant . I don't know how he keeps a job between him and the school board, they just don't seem to have any interest in the taxpayers . They keep yielding . You see, you yield to these people and what happens ? One after another like WNEP, they all just -- they don't want to pay their fair share. They want the burden to fall on the rest of us. Then I hear go vote if you don't like it. Around here the poll -- you try to vote, it's a popularity contest. The man that got the most money for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 the television commercials and so on can show all of these smoochie pictures of his kids and his wife running around. Then there's some bleeding heart that feels, oh, this is wonderful . Experience and political knowledge don't mean nothing around here. That's why we have such a poor, poor administration . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Rick Little. MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council . Congratulations on the winners this time. I'd like to talk about a street sign thing. Everybody talks about street signs so about 13 years ago when I still had a car because I had to do visitation going to New York all the time, I'm driving down Beech Street where it runs into South Washington . And I heard about, you know, the big thing was the Office and Poor Richard 's Pub and, you know, so I'm driving and I see South Side Bowl. And so I wanted to see where, you know, the Office was, you know. So I drive straight and my car gets stuck on the railroad tracks because the curb goes down. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 It looks like a street. It's a little bit better now. They have the voodoo place that John Basalyga built. But, you know, I walked by the other day. There should be a sign there because there's lots of streets around here, especiall y the little alleyways , Kressler Court and everything where, you know, they're dark. There's nothing there. And my car got stuck on the track and a train was coming, you know. A train was coming and I would have lost my car. I would have lost my child. And luckily some good citizens helped me and a motorcycle cop from Scranton Police Department came and, you know, was able to lift my car off the tracks. But this is ridiculous , I mean, 13 years. It looks like you could drive straight and you can't. And I learned that lesson. Anyway, I'd like to talk about the cartoon world we're living in, you know, with the media and judicial . Those are the two main problems . The media has been taking complete ly over. I mean, since 2016 there's a federal agency called CISI. And they have targeted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 conservatives . All the elections have been run by this thing. And before that, when the NDAA was passed which was sort of a part of the Patriot Act passed by Obama in 2012, it basically said that anybody in the media can say anything they want, you know, because it's their opinion and they can't be sued for it. And that's why we're watching TV. That's why we're watching , you know, Rachel Dean, you know, hello, Governor , wash your hands, sing happy birthday twice. This is how to survive Covid for two years. I mean, they're killing us. They're killing us. And we better get a handle on it. You know, I heard about, you know, on the voting day the certain voting machines in Pennsylvania for the Supreme Court judge were marking yes to no. I don't hear anything about that on the regular media but I know it's a fact. Government agencies using private contractors , this has become an epidemic of privatized contractors like the inspectors for the code enforce ment of Scranton . Oh, we have a private NEIC person. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 You see ads on the TV every day about Medicare , you know, and I get 30 calls a day. And I ask them are you from the federal government ? No, I'm a licensed contractor , you know, in flex cards. And, you know, the target is children and elderly. That's basically it. And I learned that going through the New York State Family Courts. That's why the schools are most important because they're not teaching the civics that should be taught. And it's become, you know, a Democrat -Republican thing when that really has nothing to do with it. The same with the American Rescue Act, you know, the Lackawanna County Area Agency on Aging appoints or the Health and Human Services of Lackawanna County, they appoint Area Agency on Aging to be the go-between handing out the American Rescue Act, the ERAP money. And that's another privatized thing. If these people in the government can't do the job, they have no business farming it out to all of these private entities . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 James Hogan. MR. HOGAN: How's everybody doing tonight ? My name is James Hogan. I was up here just once before probably about six months ago. I did start a nonprofit organization helping people. It's called Dark to Light. We love to help people. We've been doing this for about four years. I'm here tonight for two reasons just to ask for your help on two very small things actually . I believe they're very small but I can't get anywhere without coming here. So we just did a big haircut event at Nay Aug in the summer. And we had a bunch of barbers all over the city come up and we filled the pavilions and we just showed love to as many people as we could in the area, you know. Thankfully the Mayor showed up and everything . And, you know, she did give me her number and stuff. I don't abuse it, you know, but I'm just like that close to just -- I'm not trying to tick anybody off, you know what I mean? But let me just say two things. Weston Field, I'm not sure if that's going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 be used again for the emergency shelter . But I'm very involve d with that. Although I'm not the Keystone Mission but I have closer relationship s with the homeless all over 24/7. We set up a table there last year me and a lot of Dark to Light individual s and my son. And we love to spread the message of helping others helps yourself as well, you know, that's a big motto of ours. So we're down there about 10 of us and we got the cops called on us for simply trying to spread love. I just spent my own money on two tables, two thermoses for hot chocolate , a bunch of soup. We put smiles on everybody 's faces going into that building because I know I get phone calls from them all the time. They weren't allowed to drink or eat inside that building . They were only allowed to go in and get warm when it was below 20 degrees . So we go outside to show love to these people and we get the cops called on us. Marisa Duffy at the time was the Parks and Recreation person. I know it's now Scott Gassenmeyer . I got to meet him.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 However , over 20 calls and e-mails to both of them with no response . Last year Marisa Duffy's the one came out before they called the cops, the Keystone Mission and told me I needed to stop passing out the hot chocolate on the sidewalk of Weston Field. I needed to leave. She said she could help me though with just signing and getting a peace of paper signed because we do it all over the city. We do it at the shelter . We do it at the pavilion . We do it all over. But when we go to the emergency shelter when it's really cold, the Keystone Mission doesn't want us over there. Unfortunate ly it's a fact. We're not looking for any credit for anything we do. We simply just love helping people. And we don't -- we just want to be there to be allowed to stand there to give them a little bit of something warm before they go to sleep. That's all. So I'm just asking if you guys are aware of any form that Marisa Duffy had said I could come here and ask for. She said I needed to come to you guys. So on top of that at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 end of the haircut even last year, Mr. Gassenmeyer I believe his name is, he was setting up a big tent or a big video screen for a movie. And I got to meet him when I was pulling out all the chairs. And we had such a great talk. And I explain ed to him what's going on and I need some help. Oh, well, I'm your guy. I'm new. I was put in here for this and this won't happen now. I assure you I'm not trying to get anybody mad. But I've called his office over 10 times in the past two months. I've showed up in person. I've written him e-mails. There is no reason like in my eyes right now -- and now I'm becoming , like, hurt and a little bit bothered because I love the people that are less fortunate, like, how are they not important ? I'm just being told that he's just busy. He's just busy. I just seen him here. I wasn't going to ask him anything . I just want to do this the right way. How could we continue to try to spread love in this area and help people? How can we do it? There's -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 we're being stopped . And I'm just asking for just a tiny little bit of help that we need to be able to continue on. I'm trying to prepare myself to not have the cops called on me this winter. Is there anything that could be done is my question . Just to simply sign something which she said there's a paper that could be signed so I could do it legally . Lastly -- I wasted too much time on that. There's something that's very sentimental to me and to us which is Sweeney Beach. And Sweeney Beach is a beautiful area where we've done service s with the homeless . We've actually taken -- many of them have been baptize d them in the river. But to put church aside we don't push God on people. We're saving lives off the river and we're setting them up with a bunch of Christians and good people that come to that area. And I get them to be mentored one on one and we get them up off the river into apartment s, into homes. I'm not allowed at Sweeney Beach no more either and it's hurting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 us. Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Hogan. I believe there are some forms that do need to be filled out through the Parks and Recreation Office. Mr. Voldenberg , can we inquire as to exactly what forms would need to be filled out in order for Mr. Hogan and his group to set up at these various places, Weston Field, what have you? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. I'll secure the forms and reach out to Mr. Hogan. MR. KING: Thank you. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . I'd like to start off a bit here with Nay Aug Park. What I see is the most asinine thing going on millions of dollars , the stupidity filling the pool in with dirt. When simplicity would test borings 3 inch, 4 inch holes around the area, dumping some dye in the water and see where it comes out from and then you seal that area with Gunite or a substance similar to it and you stop the leak. The stupidity that I'm watching here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 that's taken place up there, you can't even put it in words. When they put a liner in it was (inaudible ) some of you may remember that. Us old gray hair people remember that. It's a natural cut. It had fissures in it. In the mines what did they do before they did the test drilling ? Test bores, small ones when they filled the mines up so you knew where you were going. That should be done. Talk to engineers and stop letting them worry about how they're going to rip us off. Let's figure out how we mitigate the cost of what we're doing there. And I could get you people that could do it. I own environmental companies . And we do this when we're trying to find both substance that's leaking , that's a contaminate and stuff. So it's simplicity if you use common sense. There's two trailers yet with disinfectant wipes that my fellow masons and myself have donated. One is still at Weston Field. The other is up in Clarks Summit at the firehouse there No. 4 and they're free. People should have -- take them, use them. That's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 what they're there for. Everybody that was -- how do I put it -- impacted by the flood, they're there. Use them to clean up what you need to do. Don't spend any money. They're free. That's what us masons are about. We're out to help people. And we've done that. Now, the flags which has annoyed the living hell out of me. I was in Florida . But I made sure these flags were ordered two for here Israeli and Ukraine . The Government Center, Ukraine , Israel and the Courthouse . I don't want to listen to the stupidity . I've been through all of those countries . I've been through Gaza. I've been through Saudi Arabia. I've been in Iraq, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi. I had an office in downtown Tehran. Don't educate us on what these animals have done to people. Remember Hamas attacked Israel, not the other way around. Now everybody is getting involved . We're involved in Ukraine . But remember , no matter what uniform you wear, it's an American bullet killing a Russian . Joe Biden is putting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 us in World War III whether you believe it or not. He let million s of people come through the borders , terrorists , and everything else. And we're going to get hit here. Hear are my words. It's going to happen. You haven't been in countries like I have in the past. It wasn't military wise. It was business wise on what goes on over there. You think it's a pleasure to see a young girl on a motorcycle screaming for help while her boyfriend 's got a rifle in his back by those animals ? What kind of life do you think she's going have if she even survives or anybody else? We need to fly those flags. This is our city. And I'm here asking tonight . I talked to the Mayor. I don't want to hear it's a touchy situation , get people out. That's going to happen one way or the other whether they go into Egypt or anywhere else. Hamas attacked innocent people. And I don't care what your nationality is. You're a human being. Butchering babies, raping women, murdering people just for the hell of it, you got to deal with the animals . Out here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 we flew the flag. You few the (inaudible ) flag for a month. You flew the black flag for a month. We wanted to have a convoy and use the square down here we were told we couldn't use it. Yet you had the BLM people down there doing everything they wanted to do. You need to turn around the veteran flag. That flag right there is what America is about. And those flags, veterans flags, look at all the crosses all across the country . All over the world those little white flags, those guys never got a chance to come home. What did these other people that we're flying their flags do to honor America ? Not a damn thing. They didn't give their lives. They didn't do anything . We need to honor the people. That Washington DC protest , those clowns from the colleges and everywhere else protesting what's going on over in Israel are a joke. Israel should level Gaza and turn it back into the desert is what it needs and take these people that have done what they're doing and take them to task. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Please put the flags up and let's honor those that are being really prosecuted and persecuted by these animals . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. That exhaust s the sign-in list. Is there anyone else who would like to speak before Council ? MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Forgive me if I ask question s about things you may have discussed . I got here late because I had a conflicting board meeting . With regard to Mr. Argenta 's request for a list of city vehicles , I've seen such a list before. And I'll try to get my hands on it again and make sure that the women's name is Gracie Franco. She, I guess, is the open records officer for the city. If I get it, I'll make sure she gets a copy so she could forward it to Mr. Argenta . What is the status of the 2022 audit? MR. KING: Frank, have we heard anything in reference to the Scranton Sewer Authority ? I believe it was Attorney Shrive. That's what's holding it up. MR. VOLDENBERG : As of today, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 BA's Office is still waiting on the opinion from Attorney Shrive on that one change. I'll follow up. MR. KING: If you could, please. MS. HODOWANITZ : I think it's time for the BA office to go down and kick in some doors. This is unacceptable . The firefighters ' contract is still not on the website . It's 219 days. I don't understand how you could be making expenditures with backpay and pay raises and we don't have a written contract . When are we going to have the contract ? MR. KING: We'll keep inquiring . We ask constantly when that's going to be uploaded . Apparently it's back and forth with the union and the city attorneys . MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, somebody is making a profit and it's not the taxpayer . There was suppose d to be a meeting today with the three taxing authorities to discuss possible relief actions for those who are affected by the flood. Did that happen? MR. KING: That did happen this morning . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MS. HODOWANITZ : Can you brief us in Fifth Order about the results of that meeting ? MR. KING: Sure. MS. HODOWANITZ : Thank you. Item 5-C, the amendment to the 2023 budget to transfer $850,000 from the contingency account to the police other salary. That in effect zeros out the contingency fund and apparently it's to cover the arbitration award and which is backpay and unbudgeted police retirements . If there are unforecasted, unbudgeted police retirements , what is the staffing situation in the police department ? Anybody know? It's something you need to look into. Are we going to have to compensate with overtime ? Are we budgeted for that? How is that going to affect your 2024 budget calculations ? Do we have a safety net financially for that? That's something you might want to ask when you talk budget. And with having no contingency fund left, let's hope we don't have any emergencies between now and the end of the year. And with regard to the proposed 2024 budget, I read in the paper that the Mayor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 said, quote, we propose a 3.5 percent real estate tax increase in line with the Pennsylvania Economy League's Act 47 exit plan recommendation of modest annual increases . And she projected that the average residential taxpayer would have their bill increased by $36.33. Now, keep in mind that taxes went up 2 percent last year. She wanted 3 percent . You gave her two. Let me tell you, this is the exit plan from October of 2021. Let me tell you what PEL did say, quote, the coordinator recommends that the city increase its property tax millage rate by 5.1 percent , 14.8 percent and 0.7 percent in the years 2024 through 2026 respectively to eliminate the projected operating deficits in those years. Now, if that had transpired ignoring the 2 percent last year, we would have an increase of 20.6 percent by 2026. It's going to be more than $36.33 if that happens. And also keep in mind it's not taking into account the school district taxes and the county. You all have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Hodowanitz . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, congratulations to all the members of Council who are going to be staying . I wanted to address and thank Dr. Rothchild last week for when I had asked about the voting for Geisinger and the change of opinion , she had talked about meetings she had gone to beforehand. And she offered at that time after the meeting to open up her phone records and her meeting records and let me review them. Though I never considered and expected that she was not at any of the meeting or any of those conferences , I wanted to make it clear that she did offer the transparency to me to take a look at that records . And that is something I did not expect, did not ask for. But I needed to address the fact that the records were freely offered for me to take a look at. And that's clarity that we've lacked a lot in this government . City vehicles , if you're not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 tracking them, if the city is not tracking them, doesn't know who takes them home, doesn't know where they go to, doesn't know how much is being used for private and personal use off the job with the gas cards and not, it seems to me like the city is colluding in federal tax evasion because anything that is granted to -- when those cars go home to employees , that portion of the time that they are used publically is considered income and revenue for those employees . That has to be reported as federal income tax. That's not just a we're giving it as a benefit . Whatever percentage of time the employee has to use them has to be cut out, has to be reported and has to be put to the IRS as an extra benefit for the job. Not doing that and not having the records of it is just saying we want to violate IRS law. So if the city is not complying and not knowing where any of those vehicle s are, you got a serious problem because you're dealing with IRS fraud. We had a comment about the pickleball courts. I would love the pickleball 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 courts to be reduced and maybe off of the splash pad. Have an ice skating arena for the winter. Most cities like Philadelphia , they have spring events, summer events. And at City Hall in Philadelphia , they put an ice skating rink out for the people in Center City even though they have ones down near the river. It would be nice if the park could be used year round, not just a drive-through in a car to look at Christmas lights. But hey, you know, we had that stand up front where we actually had concessions . You know, ice skating and hot chocolate and having something up there, it would make it look like an actual family park, like, something you would want to go to year round. But I guess we only want it for six hours a day a certain number of weeks for swimming and then close it down and just pay for maintenance for the rest of the year. We have to tap into reserves for the budget. And we're looking at 3.5 percent real estate increase . It's kind of interesting when you look into the numbers . Most of the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 administration is getting a 4 percent to 6 percent increase before contract s are even done. I see the Business Administrator needs another raise. But it does not disclose in that document the added pay she gets from the OECD monitoring that is on top of it. That's not -- that's not disclosed that she gets a secondary check for those four years bringing her to the highest pay. We need to give her another raise on top of that. And even more than that, we have the deputy administrator who gets a 50 percent pay increase -- not 5, not 10, 50 percent increase . It was also question ed on housing in the city. Where do we house the poor? How do we get them off the streets ? Take a line out of Baltimore . Take a line out of the big cities. When someone builds a multistory dwelling they have cut out of it in the budget that 10 percent of that building has to be zoned for low income housing . So if you're building a thousand units, a hundred of them have to be set aside for low income or you don't get to build those building s.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 You want to get the homeless off the street, you've got to put in teeth in there to make people actually force builder s who make the money to put some of it back in. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I'd like to talk not what I planned when I came tonight but on time management . I think when you guys have a premeeting meeting , it should -- five minutes would be one thing, but going over it by half an hour and letting people who came, I don't think that's right. I think you should adjourn and pick it up maybe the following week. I'll let you figure it out, but that needs to stop. And then we talked about -- it was on the 10th of October I brought some signs that were left after construction on East Mountain Road. And Mr. Smurl has told us that they were going to call the enforcement -- code enforcement and see who pulled the permit for that so they would be the ones that should be contacted to remove the signs if they're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 complete . I believe they're complete but the signs are still there. So what happens next? MR. SMURL: I saw the construction company up on the mountain I believe two days ago doing patching again where that sunk in where they had (inaudible ) so the signs are up again. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I think they need to go. Now, getting back to one of my favorite things is stormwater . It's all over the city. But there is a plan I think for -- let me go back. Would you prefer to extend a stormwater pipe to the nearest drain or if it was like 15 or 20 feet or would you rather have the DPW come up every day when it's freezing to put salt on the roads? Anybody have any -- MR. KING: Are you talking about East Mountain ? I don't know where you are referring to. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, it's Snook Street. MR. KING: Snook Street. Well, there's obviously a huge stormwater study that had gone on. HRG did it. We just had the meeting October 25th, up at Howard Gardner and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 there's a plan to address Snook Street, East Elm Street. MS. SCHUMACHER : I know that. I know that. But what I'm saying is now. Do you know how much traffic goes across Seymour Avenue and you've got a -- you've got -- all of the water that comes down Snook Street and goes down to 307 is from one place. And that -- if you go about 15 to 20 feet above where the water is coming out -- that stormwater is coming out of the pipe is a drain that goes in, you know, there are drains on Snook Street and there are not drains. But 15 to 20 feet I would think you would prefer to put that -- figure out how to get that water into that drain so it goes as it should be rather than go down and go into ice. I remember last year the ice was four or five inches. MR. KING: I'll have to inquire because I know that they've been working up on Snook Street too. There's a major project going on there even like that section of Lake Scranton is closed off because it's all tied in there.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, they put a road -- road signs, yeah, I'm aware of that. But that doesn't solve the water problem that goes on all the time. So I do not know why we can't get somebody up there to get that water that is now going down into a drain which there is a drain, like I said, 15 or 20 feet away. How much pipe is that? MR. KING: We can inquire with Mr. Pietreface if you would, Mr. Voldenberg , ask him why the existing water that's draining on Snook Street if it can't be tied in with a temporary pipe or something like that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask if they could do that work in the interim . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . Is there anyone else who would like to speak? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: I do not at this time, Mr. King. MR. KING: Mr. Schuster , any motions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a couple comments . As we just got a copy of our budget for the new year, we started off our caucuses here tonight . We had the Mayor. We had the BA. We had Parks and Rec, OECD. We're going to start these conversations . A couple things that stuck out right off the bat was this budget this year is very similar to budgets in the past three years. We do see pay increases for lots of positions . We do see a tax increase similar to last year. So one of the question s was thoughts on the tax increase , my first thought on the tax increase is that we had $50,000 allocated to complete a study on Scranton taxes with a goal of trying to reduce some of the taxes in our city. That money was reallocated to another position I'd say two years ago. I did fight to keep that money dedicate d to that study because I would have liked to see that study take place. So this is something I still would like to see. This administration had promised that they would look into studying the taxes in our city and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 seeing if we could reduce them. And I would like to see that move forward . I did see that Spotlight PA article as well about the non-profits . And I think I had I mentioned it when that came out. But we do see increased salaries . One thing I want to point out to all of Council I pointed out for three years, we've had three years of salary increases . Now this year we don't have as many new position s as we've had in the past. I think we've had about 10 to 12 for the last three years. This year we have five to six. And we do have salary increases . To look at some of those increases , the executive assistan t for the Mayor in 2021 we had a 2 percent increase . Into 2023 we had a 23 percent . And now we're looking at another 3 percent increase . These are large increases . From 2022 to 2023, we're talking $10,000 increase in salary. We're seeing increases for the IT Department . We're seeing increase s for the Treasury Department , code enforce ment, the Law Department that we've adjusted last year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 I would suggest that Council freezes salaries . I think we had a lot of increases over the last few years and that would be my first suggestion on this budget. Mr. King, did you attend the tax relief meeting that occurred today? MR. KING: Tax relief -- for the flood victims , I did, yes. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And you'll have an update for Fifth Order? MR. KING: I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That was something I would have like an invite to as I am the Finance Chair. I would have liked to have been involved in that meeting . We did get a question about the police department and thank you to our officer tonight . The police department has 111 officers currently . But we can go up to 147. We do have a couple positions that do get a stipend from our ARPA funds. We discussed it a little bit tonight in caucus. And I would have like to have gotten that answer. I know we've had it in the past. But if we could just send a quick e-mail to ask for those handful of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 positions . I know Jessica Eskra, Eileen Cipriani , and there might be one other -- and if we could also include Matt Domines ' to see what his salary breakdown is because I know there's some funds that he's getting there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . Keyser Valley was brought up tonight that there would be a meeting in December . I would suggest that the meeting take place at the Keyser Valley Community Center. And I think the point of contact should probably be the President of the Keyser Valley Neighborhood Association . He did get a tour of the neighborhood together with a lot of the neighbors from down there. And he does reach out to those neighbors . So I think if he was the point of contact along with having the meeting at the community center, we should be able to get most of the neighbor s attending that meeting so they could have direct communication with the administration . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 I'm sure I have a couple other things that I've forgotten , but that will be all for tonight , Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. I've got quite a few things I'm going to try to move through quickly . First, one of the biggest things on my list and what I have been mention ing for quite some time now has to do with parking for those with disabilities who use a handicap placard or might have signs, like, that they paid for in front of their homes so that they could park there. I've been receiving complaint s from a number of people about it, people who, you know, have others parking in those spots who might not have a handicap placard or those who are, you know, parking partially in the spot and not really giving them enough space to be able to utilize that -- that spot. And I know I requested a couple weeks ago to Solicitor Gallagher to take a look at that ordinance which he did and responded to. But I want to see what else we could do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 with regards to enforcement of that ordinance , maybe evaluating if there needs to be an increase in fines because people clearly are not taking seriously and even if they do get a ticket, they still might be repeat offenders . And I'm also communicat ing with SPD. I spoke with the Chief about this issue too because it's, you know, clearly affecting many residents who need the handicap parking in order to access their properties and if that's not available to them, then they have to try to walk or get quite a distance to their homes which might be very difficult if they are using an assisted device. So that is something that is really important to me that I want to continue to work on addressing and so I've got some ideas about how we can do that moving forward . Another complaint , I've received some updates today -- some updated pictures on Front Street over in South Side. It's pretty much in the same state that it was. I know that there were quality of life tickets issued but I'm wondering now if there's a status with the magistrate because clearly nothing 's been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 done with that property . MR. VOLDENBERG : I sent that followup this afternoon , Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Excellent . I appreciate that. And then some updates with regards to some of the paving within the Hill Section . So particularly Prescott Avenue and then Myrtle, I've been talking to a lot of neighbors about that situation . And I think that is relevant to pave cut issues and other problems that I think need to be addressed in the future. But with those streets directly for Prescott Avenue, the response we received is that they'll be installing a permanent base within the next 10 days and then an overlay done early December if the weather is good. And we received several e-mails stemming back from September if the weather is good -- if the weather is good and pretty soon it is not going to be good. And so I'm very concerned and worried that those fixes might not take place before the winter. And I want to see what pressure we can put on American Water to make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 these fixes because the streets are in -- they left them in terrible condition for months on Prescott and now they are doing the same to Myrtle. And we just received notice of another rate increase with them so what are we paying for here I think is the question that a lot of resident s have and rightfully so. And then for Myrtle they said no overlay will be coming until the spring. Myrtle was address ed recently and will be fixed weekly until permanent restoration can be completed , which still isn't much of an answer. And then the -- for Prescott if I mentioned too that base within the next -- that was going to laid within the next 10 days. That was an e-mail from November 2nd. Today is the ninth. So -- MR. VOLDENBERG : We'll follow them closely , Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Three more days to be able to do that and I haven't seen any work done there. And we did receive a request for lighting around the area of 600 North Garfield and Pettibone Street. And I know you sent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 correspondence and sent the information on how to obtain the petition for those residents to be able to get a light there. So I appreciate that. And I had receive d a question with regards to the recycling bins. They went to go pick up some at DPW and there's a sign that there were no red or blue bins available so if we could please find out from DPW when they plan on having those recycling containers available for people. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out. DR. ROTHCHILD : And I know this is also the time of year that they have some leaf bags for resident s. So if we could also find out if they have those available for people. I received a complaint about 1219 Jackson Street. And there is a neighborhood cleanup that I had done with Neighbor Works over the summer and actually Kathy Carrera from our Clerk's office she had joined me and a couple of others. And we worked along Jackson Street right along that area. And I know exactly the property that they're talking about. And it is been just a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 shame how much garbage and trash and material is there on that property . They are renters there. I think they said someone had gotten evicted but then the renters that moved in were, you know, just as bad with it. And there's trash along side of the property that's also blocking a potential fire escape. So they know that there have been tickets to that property in the past and I think they mentioned also having gone to the magistrate 's office. So I want to see what else we could do to get the problem correct at that property . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll see where they're at on that property . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And I didn't see any response for the -- there was some request over in Green Ridge for crosswalks. Did we receive anything and I missed it? MR. VOLDENBERG : Nothing as of today. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Can we check again? MR. VOLDENBERG : It was reported and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 requested but I'll follow up. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, because we're also running out of time for painting crosswalks . So I would like to see if we could get a response on that. And I had mention ed in caucus when we had them presenting about Clover Field that I receive d a complaint that there is a tractor -trailer driver that drove onto parts of the grass on Clover Field. So I want to get Parks and Rec out there which I did inform Mr. Gassenmeyer so that they can take a look and see what damage there is from -- from that vehicle . That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. I have two things, so with regards to caucus and the first budget meeting I agree with Mr. Schuster . So there should be a pay freeze this year. I'm not talking about the contractual obligations . I'm talking about the same people that every year or employees that when it's presented to us get large raises or propose d large raises, some not even here a year, some six months. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 And we're told, oh, you know, they need more money. How are we going to retain them? That hasn't been effective either because it's still a revolving door. So that's not working . And when we -- these salaries are listed. It's not total compensation . It might say 50 here, 70 here, 90 here. You have to add $30,000 to that with bennies. So it's been the biggest point of contention with me because last year there was 12 they want -- the administration wanted 12 new positions and that equated -- and substantial raises for a select few. That equated to the same -- numbers don't lie. That equated to the tax increase , same amount. Scarey, isn't it? So we just got this draft budget. I didn't take a deeper dive. I want to run the numbers again and see who it reflects the increase s that are being asked for. I just think, you know, we've given -- we all agreed or I thought we agreed to incremental raises and then if need be incremental tax increases to stay out of Act 47. It's not -- these raises aren't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 incremental . We've given substantial ones more than the national average the past four years, right, so that's the issue I have. So to reel it back a little bit, I'd also be in favor of a pay freeze. Okay, and then next, so I receive d a couple questions from actually the resident s and we also a got an e-mail from the city controller about the towing contract that expired 10/31. So and it's a 15 vendor towing contract . So, you know, Mr. Voldenberg , could you please find out is it going to be put out to bid again? I only remember it getting renewed . But I think at this point it probably should go out to bid. And can you inquire about that and see what the plan is for that instead of some type of emergency legislation that we have to hurry up and renew this contract , you know, because of, I don't know, reasons that will be present ed to us that maybe we don't agree with. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions , sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 you. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few responses , Norma Jeffries the leaf truck is out daily primarily following the paper and cardboard recycling schedule . Leafs are placed out in bags are also picked up during paper and cardboard recycling schedule . The street sweeper is in use and primarily follows the trash pickup schedule . Delores Parker, response , the unit block of Hertz Court was reviewed by DPW Pave Cut Inspector and City Project Manager and will have the roadway patched to a safe level. In terms of the budget, this is an introduction , you know, asking for 3.5 percent . Now we all have to go to work and dive into this budget and take a look at it and make suggestions as to what we think, you know, differentiate between needs and wants and then ultimately , you know, come back to the Mayor and say here's where we're at. Here's what we could live with. Here's what we think is reasonable . I know that this Council we asked for two new positions to deal with, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 trash in the city and picking up in the, you know, throughout the city. And I think it's greatly needed. So those are certain things that I'd like to see stay in the budget. In terms of Nay Aug Park, Mr. Mancini , I know that the funding for Nay Aug Park we're looking at some LSA money I think of a million dollars there. We're looking at I think 3 million dollars of ARPA funds and applying for a RACP, 3 million dollar RACP to use as a match to help pay for that project . But that is the funding we're -- the ball is rolling on that project . So we sent to the Mayor what our suggestion was, what we would like to see with the two pool option. And, in fact, asked what the difference would be between the six lane pool and expanding it to the eight lanes. So it would be a larger pool. So we'll be waiting to hear back from them on that as well, okay. In terms of you mention ed that lawsuit . I found that interesting that the -- that particular -- that hospital was originally a nonprofit and then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 the courts decided that it wasn't. That's why we're doing that HUP test. And we hired that company to go out and take a look at that. Now, I'm not sure if you're aware, but Regional and Moses Taylor are both for profit. They came back on the tax rolls probably about I think around 2012, 2013, somewhere in that range. Geisinger has not. So hopefully when they go through and do this HUP test they may determine that when some of these nonprofits originally applied for tax exempt, maybe they are not meeting the original mission when they applied for it. So the hope is that maybe some of those will no longer be renewed as nonprofit and have to start paying taxes moving forward . That's the hope. I know that Dr. Rothchild mentioned Pennsylvania American Water Company , we got an e-mail today from one of our residents I think it was Faye Franus. She indicated that she received something in the mail today. I don't get my mail until six or seven at night. So I don't know if I got it yet. But I know that we sent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 a letter last time. But it was too late because the tax increase had already happened. But if we're getting notice now that they're looking to do an increase , now is the time that we should be fighting it. So we'll look to do that. And I want to research that a little bit further . So I'm not sure if everybody has received those notices . I didn't get one yet. Maybe I did today, I don't know. But now is the time to attack it before the tax increase goes up. And I did meet today myself, the Mayor, the Business Administrator , the Acting Superintendent of the Scranton School District . It was also Chris Chermak , County Commissioner and Debbie Dominick stopped in as well to talk about tax relief for those stormwater victims . Generally it seemed like all three taxing bodies were interested in providing relief. The question is going to be -- especially I'm trying to determine exactly who gets the tax relief and who doesn't. I believe that everyone is on the same page in terms of if homes were condemned , I think that one absolutely that I think all three taxing bodies 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 are in agreement on that. They want to go back and have their solicitor s look over it to make sure we have the authority to be able to do that. I don't see why we wouldn't. So that is an ongoing conversation . But the hope is that we could move on that in the next couple weeks because the goal would be to provide the tax relief going into 2024 since the vast majority of 2023 is over with. And I know that happened on September 9th. So we're over eight months of 2023 taxing year. It would be very difficult to try to go back on 2023. But at least moving forward for those condemned properties , I believe all three taxing bodies are absolutely interested in providing tax relief for those victims who lost their properties . And I know that Council and the city is also offering that $5,000 funds available through the Scranton Area Foundation will be the ones that the applications go through . So hopefully , you know, I think Eileen Cipriani indicated to I think 93 applications were submitted so far for up to $5,000. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Some people may have submitted 3,300, I don't know, 4,000, 5,000, what have you. But hopefully that will be a pretty quick and streamline d process so those people could get relief that had to replace boilers or whatever they have to do. So that's all I have at this time. MR. SCHUSTER : Can I ask one thing, Mr. King? MR. KING: Yes. MS. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , today I was told by the Mayor that Council received the substantially damaged list or substantially damaged report of the addresses of the properties that were affected by the storm. She said that I received it on the 2nd of November . It wasn't something I was aware of. Do you know if we receive d a list of affected properties ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did receive a listing today, a number of lists regarding condemn and damaged properties . But I'll check the November 2nd response . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I was looking through it now. And I don't see that list. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 But we did get a list today. MR. VOLDENBERG : Today we have a number of lists and it might be in that group. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. KING: I receive d a list at the meeting today. MR. SCHUSTER : We didn't receive one on the 2nd of November though, right? MR. KING: I don't recall. MR. VOLDENBERG : I don't believe so. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

TO PERFORM CITY 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 OF SCRANTON ’S REQUEST FOR NORTH SCRANTON STORMWATER ENGINEERING SERVICES . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-M be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , very similar to the Nay Aug Pool contract that we got into in this in 5-M and also in 5-N, it's being conducted the same way. So we're agreeing to both phase one and phase two. So we're saying that phase one is not to exceed 74,000 and change. But we're agreeing to a phase two. And it's stated in backup documentation that we're going to negotiate the price of phase two. So can we please reach out to the administration and ask them what their plan is for negotiations of this and why Council should be approving this contract without the pricing and plan for phase two? And also something I want to point out is, there's a couple actions and events 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 that go along with this. One was a kick-off meeting with the city that happened on the 26th of October . So the contract is in front of us today. It's the 9th of November . They've already had a kick-off meeting with the city on the 26th of October . They've also done study and data collection that was occurring today the 9th. And then there's going to be a stakeholder meeting on the 13th, which is in a few days. So it looks like there's a couple actions that are already taking place by the city on some of these contract s that haven't even come through to Council yet. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. MCANDREW : I have the same issue. How do you negotiate the second phase of a contract when you have a contract ? I've never seen anything like that before in my life. I mean, contracts are binding and the costs are clear. So please, you know, before final passage we get some type of explanation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 That's nonsense . MR. KING: We definitely need to have an explanation of that. I don't want -- I would like to introduce it to get the ball rolling on this because obviously the stormwater issue is a big issue. But that is important so if we could get some answers on that. We'll get it introduced. If we don't get the proper answers we can always table it at the next level. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree. I think those are all valid concerns although I would like to see it move quickly and I hope we get a quick response because as we know with stormwater , it's, you know, a ticking time bomb until the next flood. So I want to see us be able to get those engineer ing services as soon as possible but we certainly need those answers . MR. SCHUSTER : One more thing I'd like to add, I know Mr. McAndrew brought it up earlier in regard to the towing contract . He said, you know, we don't want to see something come in an emergency action that we have take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 and be put behind the eight-ball to use that term. So something here, we had a West Mountain stormwater study. It was done three years ago. We took our time moving on it and we had an emergency situation that affected a lot of people. If these things come through in a timely manner and we get responses to our questions in a timely manner, we won't be in an emergency situation and I don't ever want to see Council deciding on things based on an emergency that's at hand. So if we could please get answers on these before final passage in Seventh Order, that would be great. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-N.

TO PERFORM CITY OF SCRANTON ’S REQUEST FOR MINOOKA AND WEST SCRANTON STORMWATER ENGINEERING SERVICES . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-N be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? I think we all agree we want the same answers . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so just an additional question here. These are two different RFPs, one I think had four people that bid on it. And this one had five that bid on it. The last question I would like to ask is, in accepting the bid there is a 10 percent possible savings if both projects are completed by this company . Was that something that was taken into consideration when we accepted the bid? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR.

SMURL: As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I know that we did get some of our questions from last week and the week before I think we got some of the answers sometime today. Did we -- and you might not know this offhand , did we get a list? I know I asked when this was coming through Fifth and Sixth Order. Did we get a list of the FEMA projects that are yet to be completed , those that are pending , and those that have yet to be started ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I did not see that list in the group, sir. I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. If we could request that again. Thank you. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 324, 2023 – AMENDING RESOLUTION NO. 113 OF 2022, APPOINTMENT OF ANDREW T. LAZELLA , PH.D. AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF ETHICS, TO CORRECT AN ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR IN THE TERM LENGTH FROM AUGUST 31, 2027, TO AUGUST 31, 2025. MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I wanted to mention this previously . When these pieces of legislation come down to us, they need to be the proper terms for it to come -- for them to come back to us so that we need to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 make corrections again, I mean, this is not the first time that this has happened . So, like, it's kind of frustrating that they're bringing these appointments to us but don't have the correct amount of years for their terms. I think that should be -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'd like to make a comment on that one. I think we could thank Mr. Voldenberg for picking up on this one. I did check the city's website . I think it brings up two issues. The two issues are the city's website isn't up to date. This individual 's term had expired in 2022 or -- like it was far past the end of his term. When I brought up to Mr. Voldenberg , he realize d when he went back through the legislation , the legislation was incorrect . So we got incorrect legislation that didn't go along with the charter of the board, correct , Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . MR. SCHUSTER : So the Law Department sent us down legislation that had the wrong term. So I think the Law Department should be going through their documents . And they should 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 be 100 percent correct before they get to Council . MR. KING: Agreed. MR.

VOLDENBERG : 7-C.

KING: On the question ? I would say on the question the one thing I don't see on here is when Karen Desandis 's time was suppose d to wrap up. Is that listed back here? MR. MCANDREW : I think it said last week though, didn't it? MR. KING: Did it? ATTY. GALLAGHER : It says that in backup but it's not in the legislation -- oh, no, it is, pardon me, first paragraph . MR.
