MR. KING: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community , especially Betsy Youngblood . Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. Please dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3-A. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED MAY 23, 2023 FROM OECD REGARDING CODE ENFORCEMENT REPORT FOR CITY COUNCIL . MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I just have one. So it's not June yet but almost. And June is LGBTQ Pride month. And it's one of the ones I look most forward to and the city raises a flag during that month. And I believe it's going to be taking place this Saturday at 10 a.m., if any of the members of the community are interested in attending. But I haven't seen it announced from the city so I'm not sure why. But I believe it should be Saturday at 10 p.m., for the LGBTQ Pride flag raising . That's all. Thank you. MR. KING: Anyone else have any comments ? Okay. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Derek Raines. MR. RAINES: Present . Derek Raines, 918 Monroe of Scranton . First off, my wife and I went on the Heritage Trail believe it or not, me as the guy who can't really see, can't really do much. They purchased a two person bike and I got to ride a bicycle in tandem with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 my wife. I was able to pedal and exercise . It was so beautiful anybody who lives here who has not gone on the Heritage Trail, it is wonderful . We did see one homeless person I think just because he was out in the middle of nowhere . And we did not see any loose dogs today. So I was pretty happy with that. But it was so beautiful and I am so grateful that we have something like that in our backyard . Oh, my recurring problem with my paving on my street. The holes, they seem to be getting more and more holes that just pop up. I did have the head of DPW come out a long time ago and they said they would take care of it. We still have the hole on the Ash side. And we still have the hole on the Myrtle side which is on -- they are both jumbo holes that somebody could easily fall and get hurt on. And the water issue is still there which goes all the way back to David DeCosmo when he was still a news actor. Oh, we did go to the greenhouse because you know how much I love flowers. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 we got a ton, a ton of flowers. And they were all just wonderful . It's another great thing that people in Scranton , a lot of people that we told about it they're like I didn't even know anything about it. A lot people should realize that the Scranton newspaper really doesn't tell everything . This weekend will be the Heritage Fair. If anybody goes to that I will be up at the entrance . I will be on the disability aspect of it talking to people who would like to know about whether it be -- whatever issue you have may have, multiple sclerosis , blindness , you name it. There's going to be information there for all of those people. There's going to be a lot of great food and a lot of -- MR. KING: Mr. Raines, what was that? MRS. RAINES: It's the Heritage Fair. MR. KING: Oh, the Heritage Fair, okay. Thank you. I just didn't hear you. I'm sorry. MR. RAINES: Thursday , Friday, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Saturday , Sunday. Attorney Gallagher , are you here? ATTY. GALLAGHER : I am. MR. RAINES: Well, I did something I said I was going to do for a long time. I filed a complaint with the Department of Justice against the City of Scranton for numerous issues, number one being handicap accessibility into this building . Number two, the lack of handicap throughout this whole area. I mean, how hard is it for the city to make handicap parking spaces? Attorney Gallagher , he saw my van today. And if I can't -- where is my thing? So it's a shame the city the size of Scranton does not have ADA required parking spots. They are required to be everywhere , every corner should have those little corner things on them. I can't think of what they are called. Unfortunately -- here's my visual. This is what my wife and I use when we go somewhere without a place and we set this next to the car because if somebody parks next to us, I can't get back out of the car. And it's truly such a shame that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 behind this building there is no handicap -- legal handicap parking . And they said, oh, we did this -- we did this -- if you look at the signs they made, they are not legal handicap signs. It's like somebody got a little label and made them. They're just horrible . We need to have true handicap accessible signs for handicap parking . I don't think it's too much to ask. So they said, well, would you like to go further ? They gave me a whole list of attorneys and people like that to go on with my lawsuit against the city. I will talk to Attorney Gallagher and see would it be better for me to file a lawsuit against the city because they don't have any legal -- they don't have any true handicap parking or would it be cheaper for the city to do the right thing? To me it's a no-brainer . We have all of these people that work for DPW. It's not like they're working 24 hours a day -- oh, is my time up? MR. KING: Yeah, that's all right, Mr. Raines. I'm going to speak in Fifth Order 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 about some of the things that are going to happen with handicap parking. I met with the Mayor today. MR. RAINES: Well, I'm sorry I have to go. This thing is just killing me, this grueling vest that I'm wearing and it's just killing me. Thank you all so much. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Raines. As you're pulling out I will let you know that the engineering department is prepping to identify all of the handicap parking throughout the city and that's going to get handed over to DPW to address in the very near future. I know that Dr. Rothchild has been hot on that one. So we're moving forward . Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Next Monday, June 5th through June 11 which is a Sunday, seven days, the Friends of the Scranton Public Library are having their next book sale. As usual it's at the Marketplace at Steamtown on the second floor right in front of Crunch Gym. Now it's a real bargain . They have hard cover, soft cover books. We have, you know, children books, fiction , nonfiction , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 CDs, DVDs. We'll even have vinyl records . Okay, this is an example of a book that I bought at a prior book sale for two dollars . It's hard cover. It's Doris Kerns Goodwin 's Team Rivals about the political genius of Abraham Lincoln. If you know anything about Doris, she is a Pulitzer Prize winner historian . She was a great writer. She's much like David McCullough . And speaking of Doris, she will be our guest in the Lackawanna County Library System on September 13th at the Cultural Center. She is an A-list lecture r. She's going to be great. So mark your calendars Wednesday , September 13th. I'm not sure of the time. It's usually around 6 p.m. We have ample opportunity to work out those details. Now, I hope you all enjoyed the holiday . I had the pleasure of going to Cathedral Cemetery for the service that they had up there. And it's inspiring to see all the flags on the graves of our veterans and to remember those who died on active duty serving the country . You also remember first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 respond ers who may have died in service to their communities , which is one reason why I'm particularly annoyed for the last several weeks. I don't know how many of you when you come to this building ever look up at the American flag flying in front of the building . But for several weeks it's begun to have problems . One edge, one hem is coming apart. You only notice it when there's a breeze and you see it, you know, unfold. I don't know how many people realize this. There's a US statute on the proper protocol for the United States flag. And once it begins to tatter it should be taken down and repaired if it's a minor issue. It also shouldn 't be flown during inclement weather , illumination notwithstanding because it gets soiled. You know, the flags tend to get grayish . So I don't know, two weeks from tomorrow or two weeks from Thursday it's Flag Day. Now to have that flag flying, you know, for Memorial Day that way it's a big shame. And I didn't have time to mention it last week.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 But I would certainly hate to see it flying there on Flag Day. And somebody in this administration ought to have the responsibility of watching that flag and taking it down when it needs to be taken down. If it gets to the point where it cannot be repaired when, you known, can a tattered American flag still be flown, you know, the sewing to repair it should be invisible . If that can't be done, it needs to be retired. And the proper way to retire it is to give it to an organization like the Boy Scouts or VFW or American Legion and they will dispose of it properly by folding it into a triangle and then they smooth it and then it gets burned properly . So hopefully somebody will do that. Just to remind you that the firefighter 's contract is not on the website . The only thing on the City's website is the arbitration award which was posted on April 5th. And do we have any information on the police union contract ? It's the end of May. MR. KING: I believe there was an arbitration meeting or hearing today. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, but no results yet. All right. Now, let me just mention one thing. When you have a public caucus, please use your public voice so those of us in the peanut gallery can hear what you're saying. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . About over a month ago I mentioned 1424 Mylert Avenue. I believe there was a raid with the State Police and the Scranton Police with prostitution , drugs, chicken fighting and other things. Many people were arrested . It was a biker gang. I believe some of the people part of that biker gang were employees of the City of Scranton . I asked you to check into this but silence from then on, never a word. The city owns this building for the last several years. I brought the deed from Lackawanna County that night that I came. And nothing has been said about it. And I'd like to know who's been paying the rent in that place for the last seven years. Howard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Moss, the man who owned Green Ridge News used to own that. Is he still collecting the rent? I'd like you to find out who is paying the rent and what happened in that situation . That was over a month ago that I asked that question and I still don't -- so I'm hoping next week I'll have some answers . Also, I asked you last week about Robin Selemba forgiving the rental registration from 2022 back and the city is in dire need of money and they are going after the University of Scranton for all the apartments to get rental registration so they could get some money. Did you get that information for me that I asked you to get last week? MR. KING: I don't have an answer on that yet. MS. FRANUS: How long do you think it would take you to get that answer other than making a phone call? MR. KING: We'll work on it. MS. FRANUS: Pardon me? MR. KING: I said we will work on it, try to get you an answer. MS. FRANUS: Try, not too hard. How 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 many months have I been coming here? Next week I really do hope to expect an answer on that because this isn't right. What you're doing is you're trying to put things off so the people would never find out the truth. You pick up one rock and there's something else underneath it. This is just unheard of. I asked Frank to make sure you get those questions answered for me and you didn't on purpose I'm sure to take care of the people in the city. Now, I'm sick and tired of it. How many times have I asked to have Chris Smith, the refuse supervisor and Scott Pietreface , the Director of DPW to come in here to answer questions about their overtime ? Months and months and yet you still don't have them come in. Could you give me a reason why you are not having them come in? Please answer the question . You're taking up my time -- MR. KING: Miss Franus, this is public comment . So make your comment s and we'll take notes. MS. FRANUS: No, no, this is not -- this is public -- you're trying to say I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 have a right to ask a question ? This is not a public hearing where we could speak and we don't get answers. I'm asking you questions that I deserve an answer. So how come you haven't had them come in here and answer questions about their overtime ? MR. KING: We decided not to do that at this time. MS. FRANUS: Why not? MR. KING: I don't know. MS. FRANUS: You don't know. MR. KING: No, I don't. MS. FRANUS: Do you think maybe you're trying to protect them? MR. KING: I don't even know them. MS. FRANUS: Pardon me? MR. KING: I don't even know them. MS. FRANUS: Let me put it this way then, Mr. King. You're certainly not doing your job. You're President of Council . This is not just public comment . This is we ask questions of Council , which is another thing. I think we have a right to know your phone number so we could contact you instead going to Frank, having him contact you, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 having him contact one of you and then he calls Frank back and then you have to get back to Frank. We have a right to have -- because Jessica wrote me. I wrote her an e-mail. She wrote back two weeks later saying I'm sorry I didn't get back to you, two weeks later. Mr. King, I've written you e-mails. I never got a response . Mr. McAndrew and Mr. Schuster answer me. That's it. You don't and Jessica and Kyle said -- he never answered his e-mails. So we deserve to have a way to get in touch with you. We're paying you $12,500. And what are we getting for it? The nerve of you to say this is public comment and you don't have to answer questions . You don't have answers for the overtime . You don't have answers for Robin Selemba forgiving the rental registration . When are you going to start answering questions that the people need answers to? When are you going to stop protecting the Mayor and her cronies , when? Let me explain something else to you. A person -- a property -- Robin Selemba 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 wrote somebody up in code enforcement a couple weeks ago, last week for harassing -- harassing the people at the property with their garbage . I personally don't believe this guy that the code enforcement officer was harassing him. But that's not the point. The point is, the person called up and complained about a code enforcement officer and they got written up, okay? I called up Carrie, the human resource direct for Chris Smith harassing to the point where a neighbor had to come out and say do you want me to call the police? And I said, no, that's okay because they were picking up garbage at an apartment that was six apartments or more and they weren't supposed to be. But I wrote to her and she said I don't have a right to know what happened to him because that's an employee . But how come this person that filed a complaint , they got to know that this person got written up? Don't I have a right to know what happened to Chris Smith for harassing me? That's a question . MR. KING: I don't have the answer to that. From my understanding , any time an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 employee is disciplined or has a discipline record, but that's a personnel record and that's not discussed . MS. FRANUS: Yes, but when the person is involved in it, they have a right to know just like a police report. The person involve d has a right to know. MR. KING: Okay, thank you for your comments , Miss Franus. MS. FRANUS: Mr. King, would you please have answers for me next week? Try hard. MR. KING: Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : I wasn't sure where I was on the list so pardon the hesitation . Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And the first thing I wanted to talk about tonight is the Electric City Flower Show. It's going to be held on June the 10th. And it's from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Nay Aug Park. And I left a flier at each one of your station s if you could just take a look at that and if you have a public place that it could be display ed. And, Frank, I don't know if it's permissible , maybe you could have it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 displayed here at City Hall that it could get some publicity here, so I did leave one at your desk as well. We tried to do a lot. Last year we had, you know, what went well and what didn't go well with the flower show. One of the things that did not go well we got a lot comments on was the things for the kids. So we tried to improve that this year. And we are having a scavenger hunt. There's going to be a map that each one of the kids will get. And I think it's 10 station s that they'll go through the park and there will be different individuals to give them a stamp. And once their map is filled, they will bring it back to the SMRA tent. That's where I'll be. And I'll be taking their little maps. And at the end, there will be a drawing as to -- for all the maps that were complete d. Also, the children are going to be getting a sapling to take home with them. And there's going to be a lot of talks down at the Butterfly Garden for them as well. So we're trying to address some of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 those issues that we were given last year. Another one was the food. We didn't have a lot of food. I guess people come hungry. So we are trying to work with that as well and having more food trucks there for the display . And the third thing is we are running transportation from the city. The first stop will be at City Hall. And they'll be running up Mulberry Street. I'll get more information on that because I'm not sure exactly the time that it starts. The show starts at 10:00. I think the transportation is going to start at 11:00. But it is free, transportation to get people from the city up to the park and return to the city as well. So I'll try to have more information next week on that. That's all I wanted to say about that. And the second thing that I wanted to talk about was something that really perked my ear last week. I don't know if any of you know I was an HR director -- not a director , a project manager in HR. So I when hear things about HR here at Council or even if I hear things or read things in the newspaper , my HR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 hat goes on. So last week when it was mentioned again that there's no performance appraisal s that were given to employees , I thought , oh, my heavens, I've never heard of such a thing. I've never heard it. And then I thought maybe because this is a government entity they don't have to do that, but I don't think so. I know as an HR manager you had to really go to the supervisor s and make sure that they had those performance appraisals in. They were done at six months. And so you gave Mary Sue six months to get her act together . And then you went back in six more months to -- and do another appraisal to see if there's been an improvement . So I don't know -- it's not fair to an employee not to have a performance appraisal because how do they know if they are doing the job right or not. And I know, Mr. McAndrew , you did speak on this a few years ago. And when you don't hear something you more or less assume that it's being addressed . But when I heard it last week, I thought , oh, my heavens , they are still not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 doing performance appraisals which is completely unacceptable . So it's not only unacceptable to us the public, it's unacceptable to the employees because how do they know if they are doing a good or a bad job in what they're doing? So I hope that could be addressed and it can be, you know, started . The third thing that I want to talk about was the streets department . You know, I'm always up here complaining or -- and about things going on in the city. But I wanted to thank the Streets Department today because as I was sitting , it was a beautiful day. And I was enjoying my coffee on my porch. And I hear this ruckus outside . And it was the Streets Department filling holes that were there. I called many a time but they never came. But I just wanted to give a shout-out to the guys Brian, Freddy and John. They were just so determined to make sure that the holes in front of my house -- and not only in front of my house, but on my street were filled. And as I drove around, they did a great job in the Hill Section today. So, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 know, a shout-out to those DPW workers . And I know there's a lot of other streets that need to be -- potholes need to be fixed but a little bit at a time. And I'm glad they got to mine. Okay. Thank you, guys. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . Last week I griped about the woman in Dunmore receiving a home. There wasn't any information how -- of her abilities to take care of it, nothing about people, full families waiting much, much longer than she did. And this whole scenario stinks from favoritism . Anyway, this week is another very -- well, last week now, another very poorly assembled article about that bear allegedly attacking the two children , one was what, 14 months and the other one was five years out on a driveway in a wooded area with no supervision , nobody around them. Nobody knows what happened . Where was the mother? She ought to be arrested for neglect or the guardian . This -- it could have been tragic. But we don't know if the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 little boy threw something at the bear, if the bear had babies, you know. The conservation officer was in such a hurry to slaughter this poor beautiful animal, he could care less about the circumstances . I find him -- people like him ought to be in a slaughter house, not working for the state trying to preserve animals in the forest. And the mother -- none of this would have happened if she was with her children like she should have been. She's a disgrace and started all of this scenario . She's surely not a victim. And I'd like to -- I sure need something done about the speeding cars on North Main. We need some stop signs. Besides speeding cars, I've complained -- you can't walk down the sidewalk and all over the place because there is illegal rooming houses everywhere . I know Mr. Oleski is not capable of doing anything . So who are you suppose d to tell? Who are you suppose d to complain to besides you people? Now the place is full of the little quads running all over the place and trail bikes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 It's just a tragedy waiting to happen. You can't use the new trail that they opened up for a bicycle path. The quads are running down it racing each other. And it's just a complete unsupervised mess down there. I've been -- when it's shady out and bad weather I walked down it with my little dog. There's a boy on an electric bike that lives on the plots. I don't hear him coming and he goes as fast as he can. He doesn't belong there any more than the quads do. It's just time -- I don't understand why you can't chase one and pick them up and when the owner comes down there to get it, charge him with no license , no insurance , no inspection , one or two daddy's lose their driver's license for six months, maybe put an end to it. But my neighbor hood is absolutely full. They're not all young people. There's a couple -- there's guys up on Parker Street that they just go wild with it, I tell you. I see him almost every day. Like -- who can I complain to about speeding cars and quads and sidewalks besides 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 you people? MR. KING: Scranton Police Department . MR. ELLMAN: Yeah. Thank you for allowing me to let off some steam. MR. KING: You're welcome , Mr. Ellman. Mr. Voldenberg , can you please contact the Scranton Police Department and ask them to take a look at the issues concerning the speeding cars on North Main Avenue along with the quads and motorcycle s? I don't think they're actually not suppose d to be on trails at all either. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Good evening , Members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . Now, I do understand some of the arguments coming up here about DPW and the overtime and record keeping . When you take a look at the amount of snow days that were marked down for overtime and they break the -- exceed the amount of actual snowfall days during that period of time, it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 does get concerning when you see more overtime targeted for snow when we didn't have the snow in that period of time. I understand some of them have to be on call just in this case it happens , but that's what an on call is. It doesn't mean go out, sit on the side of the road and wait for it. It means when it starts falling in the city somewhere they get called up to come in. They don't get preemptive overtime to go out there and sit in a truck for an event that may or may not happen because we have radar. We could tell by phones. We could tell by cities and weather patterns when the snow is going to get here and how much time we need to actually mobilize them. So having them sit out there for multiple hours waiting for a snowfall that may or may not happen and pulling in overtime , there is something seriously wrong with that whole concept . For handicap issues, I understand them very well. You may not know, but way back when I was actually taken out of my kindergarten back in Minooka . And I was put into Marshall 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 School because the City of Scranton , the educational department decided that people who were mentally ill, who were physically handicapped or had any disability had to be segregated from the regular population . We were transported to Marshall School and that's where we actually got schooling because obviously someone in a wheelchair can't be seen in a regular school. I understand it's no longer the 70s or the -- the early 70s. But the problem still is here. For two years I was in a wheelchair and then went to crutches . So I understand the difficulty of accessing places especial ly for times before you actually had laws to protect you for handicap access. It's not something that should need to be looked into for how we're going to do it. That should have been done 15 years ago. The back door locks for that handicap button. I talked about that now for month and months. How can you lock a handicap person in this building ? The button is disable d after a certain period of time when that back door locks. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 That never should be disabled because a handicap person should never be locked into a building where they may be locked in and unable to exit in an emergency . But obviously it's more secure to keep people out than to let handicap have an access to get out of the building . I also heard about parks closing at dusk and wanting to put up signs for closing the parks at dusk. I don't understand why we need to close parks at dusk. Believe it or not, I like to go up to Nay Aug Park and I like to do night photography . It's nice to have a place in the city where you could actually see stars without some of the light pollution . If we're going to close the parks at dusk, are we going to ban Geisinger or the new group from parking up there after dusk or is it only the population , the public who is banned from using that park while a commercial entity is free and clear to use part of that park's assets? Is there a gigantic drug waive up there, maybe a murder ring happening up in the park that we're all unaware of, some gigantic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 public safety issue that we need to close down that park at midnight or is that a place that the police officers can go up there, park in their car and fall asleep at night and no one will bother them because the park is closed. I find it horrible that the public is not able to use the park in the even hour. And I would actually love to see someone being able to have camp outs there, have night things there, have star parties . But obviously the nighttime is too scary for people and the public needs all to be home. I don't understand all of this. And the last comment is maybe someone should take someone from OECD, Miss Cipriani 's name off the door downstairs since she's no longer in that position . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? Mrs. Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . It's been a while since we've had a report -- I think the only report from our lobbyist . And I wonder why? Now, I read the first one and I didn't see anything on there that should not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 have been able to have been done by the Mayor's secretary . And we're paying, what is it, eight thousand dollars a month to this person? I believe that's it. It might even be a little bit over. So I would like to know why we're not getting regular reports from him. Also, I believe the nurse that we've hired or we hired, I guess, but somebody else is paying for it. So why do we not get a report from the nurse? What is the nurse doing for our public health? And do we really need a person? It seems like that's just sort of the thing everybody wants to do. The county wants to do it. The city wants to do it. I think you should be looking on how to consolidate things and save the taxpayers money than is happening . And then Norma talked about the pothole today. And I think that's great. But it's not -- very rarely is it done correct ly. I have seen them come down Seymour Avenue and they just throw a shovel full of whatever they call it -- asphalt and nobody tampers it down. Nobody puts tar around the edges so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 it doesn't get washed out the first time we have rain, although if that could cause rain I would appreciate them going out tomorrow because we sure need it. So -- and then I don't know if anybody has told -- or I don't know -- who has the HR? Who is HR? MR. KING: Kaylee M. Pikulski . MS. SCHUMACHER : No, I mean here that interfaces -- don't you all interface with different -- MR. KING: We do, yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : And which of you have -- MR. KING: That would be me. MS. SCHUMACHER : You. Okay, because I would like to see what the department of public works -- I would like to read that policy on what they're suppose d to be doing because apparently I saw in the complaints department on Harrison Avenue 525-527 and 520 and they are Lackawanna County Land Bank owned. And it is the job of the municipality in which the county has Land Bank properties that they maintain them and not let the grass grow up to their hip. So somebody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 needs to whisper in his ear and do something about that. And then -- and then Joan talked recently I believe it was about the $600,000 that we are owed for the rental -- of the property over there by the Ice Box or whatever it's called now. However , the period of time was changed and the Solicitor said that $600,000 is not due until the end of the 198th year. So I don't think any of us in this room will see the -- that money turned over to the city. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton , taxpayer . I'd like to mention once again now there's nothing worse than fentanyl that's flying around and causing overdose deaths. There's an apartment on Vine Street. And it's empty to this day and 25 people were displaced because of one apartment somebody overdosed . And I don't think that's advisable . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 And if something like that happened to me, I don't have a group situation . I think I would be more than interested in suing. I wouldn't appreciate being put out of my house because of what happened down on the second floor or up on the third floor. So it's something to consider . One of these days somebody is going to get a bright idea because they were put out and did nothing wrong. And last week the subject came up on smoking in Nay Aug Park. And, you know, I wish we could keep in mind that people are paying taxes for the upkeep of that. And here we have a bank device in my pocket -- it's locked so you push the button, no alert, no nothing . And once again you hear the cigarette butts, yeah, that is concerning . But it's time we start to punish the people that do wrong and not just punish everybody across the board. It's not right to constantly be put out because somebody else doesn't do anything right. I went to admire the buggies that a bunch of carpenter rebuilt up by the (inaudible .) Guess what I seen there? A bag 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 full of dirty pampers. Somebody threw it. This was a couple years ago. I don't go up there much anymore. But the thing is, are we going to ban babies from the park because somebody -- it's disgusting enough to throw a bag full of pampers into a buggy that a bunch of volunteers built. And once again, I would like to ask what is socialism ? Public schools, is that socialism ? Veteran 's benefits , is that socialism ? During the Civil War, you know, maybe you think it's such a great pension even though you are called up -- public transportation , tax dollars goes into that, Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid . And by the way, if somebody comes into the hospital sick or shot up or whatever , that gets figured on your insurance when they don't pay or can't pay. The hospital has to stay afloat and the government and the insurance companies and the hospital gets together and decides that it's okay for them to raise the rates. In 2006 I think it was, I picked up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 the newspaper and that was a real heavy year or the year before for medical expenses for me. And I saw George W and our Governor , and they talked Blue Cross out of a billion dollars in Pennsylvania Chip insurance . I'm all for kids being covered but you're actually taking money that sick people paid because the government is too stingy -- certain elected officials to cover children 's healthcare . Fire, do the policemen and fire ask you if you paid your property taxes? Roads and bridges , public parks and it just goes on and on, public housing , financial aid with colleges and universities , tax exemption for all of those institutions . So, you know, it seems like socialism is here already . By the way, in China if you have a child, you have to pay for the school. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta . My first problem is, there's new garbage cans up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 in West Side, North Main and Jackson . For the last couple weeks now they've been filled over the top with the household garbage . DPW or whoever does empty them and they are filled back up again. Today the bags were so full that it was blowing down Main Avenue. If we can find out who is doing or go through the garbage to see if somebody is stupid enough to leave some mail in there, maybe we should just remove them because they are definitely not good for a photo op. Secondly on the pools, Weston pool -- Weston Field, the bathhouse down there looks like it's ready to crumble and disintegrate on both ends, the roof is caving in. Tomorrow is June 1st, if not Thursday ; it doesn't look like it's anywhere near ready for swimming season. And thirdly , I'm sure you're all well aware that I've been posting blighted properties , all kind of craziness in the city. And I'm up to over about 250. Maybe you guys, open invitation if you want to meet for coffee or breakfast . I know you guys are busy and you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 have lives too. It might be better if we take a walk around and let's visibly look at that instead of me coming here with what I plan on coming here with and making a mockery out of it if maybe we could get together . You guys have some type of authority . I could show you what we're all talking about and you'll get a firsthand look and it would be better that you could bring it back to the Mayor if she's willing to sit down and look and see what it's all about. I would be willing to meet up for coffee, breakfast , and do a walk around. This is our city. And you guys all care -- and woman. I'd be willing to do my part. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Has anybody seen Waldo? Thank you. MR. KING: Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. First is a building at the bottom of Moosic Street if you're coming across from downtown you could see it. I believe it was the original Nativity Social Club. Anyway, there's third floor windows. There's broken windows. There's large pieces of glass hanging from there and also plywood pulled off the front door and glass on the streets . I think we need to have code enforcement sent there, check on safe conditions . The second one, on Memorial Day I was at a few services for our veterans . One was at the courthouse downtown . And all of the garbage cans were full and overflowing at the courthouse . I drove around town and I also noticed a lot of them were overflowing . So I would like Director Pietreface to be notified do we pick them up weekly? I thought we picked them up twice a week at one time. So if he can monitor that and determine if we need to go back to multiple pickups, I would appreciate that instead of it blowing all over downtown . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 The third one is the playground below Hanlon's Grove at Nay Aug Park, the one that we had the insufficiencies at. That's all been cleaned up. Everything 's been cleaned up this past weekend . It's prepared right now to be painted and stained so that will be done this weekend at Nay Aug Park. So I ask Parks Director Scott Gassenmeyer , I believe he's our new director , I asked that he would contact Mr. Gattens from the Recreation Authority to arrange or to see how we could get the playground mulch deliver ed down into that playground. I know we're doing the Jay Bird playground so maybe we could do that at the same time. And our -- the pool at Nay Aug -- the pool complex , we need to send out the -- administration needs to send out two RFPs need to be issued, one is for the master site plan at Nay Aug Park. The city did park reassessment s and site plans for everything except Nay Aug Park in 2020 and 2021. The plan would be specifically for Nay Aug Park. It needs to be evaluated for ADA compliance , maintenance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 needs, sustain ability and potential future development . This is one of the eligibility criteria for funding from DCNR. They require a master site plan. So if we are looking for funding or apply for funding , we must have that first. The second RFP would be for the actual engineer ing design of the pool complex and the for the drawings to be done. That's basically a feasibility study, drawings , schematics and stuff so it could be put out for bid. We're asked by the administration what we were looking for at Nay Aug Park. So this is a -- basically a template of what we are expecting for Nay Aug Park. This we're going to send to the administration , one is the splash pad. We have an approximate size of 54 feet by 38 feet which gives us about 2,000 square feet of availability with 1,200 square feet of spray area. It's similar to the one that's up at McDade Park. And with that, we've included water quality management systems , refilter , recirculate water, underground chemical 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 receptor s. And there's a company -- a Costar company that was doing theirs up there. I also put that down in here for reference , not that they have to use them. It's just that's who is being used now by the county and also for the park to enlarge the bathhouse to accommodate the amount of people that will be able to use the pool and the splash pad. That would be enlarging the existing -- the building that's there, make three separate male/female and family rooms, also include that pump house onto that. And the pool that we have discussed is an Olympic size pool 165 feet by 75 feet, basically concrete apron, lighting , cameras , and fencing . And that is just the beginning of what we're going to send from Council to the administration so that we could continue on moving with Nay Aug's pools. That's all I have, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few things. I'm happy to see that the pool is starting to move along. We've been talking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 about this for some time. I hope when it gets underway we do still have some ARPA money that could possibly be used to go towards that. I still think we should be looking back into that to see if all of that funding that we've earmarked is still relative . A little bit of history with the Nativity Social Club, when that request goes in for Nativity Social Club, could we also get if there's a history of stop work order. I know it was hit by a car. And I know that the owner of the building attempt ed to shore up the door and the city put a stop work order on it to stop work. So if individuals have entered that building broken windows , it may be -- MR. SMURL: Yeah, this is probably -- MR. SCHUSTER : Two years ago. MR. SMURL: It has been shored up. This is the window up top you could see the birds flying in and stuff now. I know they did internally gut the building . So there's nothing on the inside. So they pretty much emptied it. So it's just sitting there now and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 with the animals going in and out and a large piece of glass that's hanging . That's really a safety hazard. MR. SCHUSTER : So if we could get a little bit of history on that too just to understand what's happened with that property . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Another one that was brought up in public comment tonight the Weston Field bathhouse if we could get an update where we are with that. We -- our Solicitor currently is -- actually has written legislation on overtime for our departments . So that should be on our agenda for next week. I do have the new address for code enforce ment, Mr. Voldenberg , 1429 Hawthorne Street. The individual living there has built some kind of addition onto his house from old wood -- his own parking pad. I really don't know what's going on at the house. Also, if we could just get updates, the last couple of weeks I was sent in a couple addresses 305-307 Putnam, the rear of 1111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 Blair and also the blocks surrounding Alpha Street, Parker Street, North Main Avenue. I know we haven't gotten any updates on that yet. Those are all address that have been in for quite some time. I was happy to attend Ukrainian Veterans Memorial Day service . It was a nice event they had over there on Monday. And I'm bouncing all over the place now. I was happy to hear in public comment tonight references were made to performance evaluations . This is something that each year of the budget process Mr. McAndrew and myself had mention ed. It was -- I do think it's unacceptable that these are not current . I'm glad to see it's getting some attention from other members of Council . Also, a few weeks ago I did ask it was also brought up in public comment about our health coordinator , our health individual . It's been I'd say over a month now. I don't know where we are with the homeless population s along the expressway and other areas of the city. I ask that we reach out to her to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 see what her take was on the homeless population that this could be or -- a health issue in the City of Scranton so that's something we could also follow up on. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few updates and requests . The first one I wanted to bring up was about the performance appraisals which I had mentioned last week and request ed that we get an update on. And we were are told by HR Director Pikulski that the first order of business was to get the employee handbook completed . And now that's been finalized and is available to employees and they are working on implement ing an employee evaluation process . But that was about all that was said. There was some challenges having union and nonunion employees . So I would like a bit more of a concrete timeline on that as to what the goals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 are for when that could be completed and if that will help factor into the budget process this year. And I also wanted to request again to PennDOT , they are the ones that are suppose d to be responsible for taking care of the property -- the vacant property that's after the Harrison bridge. And that's frequently overgrown throughout the summer months and something that I've asked about a lot in the past and they said they would put on the maintenance schedule and clearly have not. So that needs to be -- there's a house toward -- like, I think a yellow house that is towards the back of it. I'm sure they access it from another road. But you could hardly see that house. And I don't know how those people stand it. They must get, like, animals and snakes and something from being so overgrown . So if we could request again for PennDOT to take care of that and put it on the regular maintenance list. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And I also wanted to respond to something that Miss Hodowanitz brought up about the American flag outside . I did not realize that it's starting to tatter. And I completely agree that it needs to be repaired or replaced properly so that we're respectful to the American flag and I think that is something that needs to be done right away. And if it's -- if it can't be repaired, it's not hard to find an American flag and for us fly it properly or have our building maintenance take care of it and remove it when there's inclement weather like she suggested . So I appreciate her bringing that to us to make sure that happens . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. DR. ROTHCHILD : And with regards to the handicap parking downtown , I did receive an update from ABM that they were working our DPW Department to get the signs up. I haven't seen if any of them have changed over yet. But they are saying that's happening . I would also like to ensure that DPW is going to work to paint the lines and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 curbs to make it clear as to where those handicap spots are. MR. KING: Dr. Rothchild , it's my understanding that Reilly Associates is preparing the specs. They are going to be sent over to DPW and that's going to begin shortly . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. And I also would to like to request that -- I know it had been mentioned during public comment but that we get the report from the lobbying firm and a report from our public health coordinator . And I think that's -- that's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I also had the great pleasure and honor to attend the Memorial Day service at the Ukrainian Club on Railroad Avenue. It was very inspiring . They did a fantastic job. I'm also glad to hear the employee handbooks are completed . I asked for them three years ago. So I can't wait to see them. I look forward to seeing them. And thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz , for bringing to our attention that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 maybe Old Glory is in a little bit of disrepair . I think we should, you know, like Dr. Rothchild said, maybe we reach out to Mr. O'Hora. That's probably his responsibility I would imagine . Maybe he could take a look at that and keep an eye on that for us. And also definitely , we need an update from the lobbyist firm Nossaman . I wasn't too happy with the last one. I actually voted no because I thought that those responsibilities should have fell on our local legislators that are supposed to do that and our inhouse people. So I'm interested to see what occurred between the last report and this one. What else? I think that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have some followup from last week's public comment . Fay Franus had mentioned rental registration . A request for rental registration department for an explanation regarding cancelation of prior year violation s has been sent. We haven't heard back yet, correct ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet, Mr. King. MR. KING: Okay. Thank you. And overtime legislation , City Council , our Council Solicitor has prepared -- is preparing some legislation that will be sent up to this body to consider for overtime . So we should expect to see that coming soon. Also, I know that Mrs. Franus had questions about this melee, whatever happened up in North Scranton over a month ago. I know we inquired about that. But, you know, we were told that it's an ongoing investigation . Andy typically the police don't report to City Council or follow up about, you know, investigations of this nature. So I don't expect a report from them as it's an ongoing investigation . Jack Watkins was here last week. He was concerned about the North Scranton Little League. Mayor Cognetti advised her office Tom Oleski in the LIPS Department , he's been in contact with Mr. Watkins to move the playground forward with attention to permits and environmental reviews .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 The playground build out is underway . Mr. Oleski continues to keep neighbors informed and attention on contractor s to get the work completed on time and correctly . Mrs. Schumacher , the Meadow Brook right-of-way easements , per Attorney Andrew Cutillo , Deputy Solicitor , the RFP has been posted on the city portal in Opengov and responses are due June 15th. Legal was proactively advertising this posting including in the weekly news letter of the Lackawanna Bar Association . The department does not expect to have any updates on the number of easements outstanding until after these services are procured and awarded contractors begin their work. The HUP test concerning pilots, that RFP went out and bids are due back by June 8th. So that is in reference to going out and monitor ing all of these nonprofit s that may have been deemed nonprofit 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 years ago. And they go out and do this HUP test to ensure that they still fall under the nonprofit of which they were initial ly granted .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 So that's going to be happening shortly . Birch Street section between Derby Avenue and Mountain Road -- East Mountain Road. Department of Public Works Office will follow up with the DPW project manager for placement on the 2023 paving list. I believe that's Birch Street. It's the upper part of Birch Street that connect s Derby to Mountain Lake Road. So that's going to get put on the list. IAFF Local 65 Firefighter 's Collective Bargaining Agreement , Andrew Cutillo , Deputy Solicitor for the city will follow up and advise on the posting of the agreement on the city website . Regarding the Scranton Sewer Authority , request was sent May 26 to the Scranton Sewer Authority for the number of easement s that remain in addition to the updated balances related to the easement escrow and then it has here Blackrock slash FNCB and then indemnity escrow which will be Delaware Trust. Also I thought since it's the end of May, I know that Mrs. Schumacher had asked me to develop some goals as President for this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 year. So I thought it might be a good idea to just kind of give an update as to where we are after five months. So the first one had to do with paving as many city streets as possible . And that list has been posted and, you know, that's moving forward . There's a list of city streets that are going to be paved. I wish that there were more. Last year we had a list that was OECD list but this year we only have a city paving list, correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , sir. MR. KING: The second was to ensure the East Mountain stormwater study was completed to occur, city administration apply for all infrastructure funds. That has been done. HRG has complete d the study which now puts us in the position to be able to apply for additional funding to address all the issues identified by HRG in this study. Work with city administration slash DPW to continue replacing old, faded, missing street signs throughout the city. That's a work in progress . I'm told there's only three 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 people in that department . But the Mayor told me this afternoon , what they're doing is building up -- they're getting the signs printed and built up. I think they have about 208 of them sitting there now. So then they'll move forward and start focusing on getting them actually put up in those parts of the city. So that's a work in progress and continuing . The next one was to bring zoning ordinance -- to bring the zoning ordinance to a hearing and ultimately a final vote and that has occurred and it's done. Make a priority to work with city administration to update the city website on a weekly basis at a minimum . We're getting there. We're still not quite where we want to be. So that's a work in progress . Push the city administration to properly plan for summer swimming as pointed out earlier at city pools by ensuring enough lifeguard s are hired in a timely fashion by ensuring that all pool maintenance requirements are addressed prior to the summer swim season. That's progressing . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 A few things that have happened, working with Red Cross to train lifeguards. They increased the hourly pay to $16 per lifeguard. Also, it's my understanding that there are three different contract ors that have been hired to address the needs of the pools I believe at Weston Field, Weston Park and at Connell Park. So that work should be commencing . Also, we encourage city administration to continue upgrade s in the city parks throughout the city. A contractor has been hired and that work is beginning at all of those parks. And there was a number of them on that list. The second one was just addressing the parks. There's upgrades to the parks. The other one was just pool related . There were three different contractors for that. The next one was to work with ECTV to improve the acoustic issues in the City Hall Chambers and that has happened. So we're thankful for that. Push administration to get work started at the Pocket Park. And that work is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 actually being done by Scranton Tomorrow . It's well on its way. My understanding is that the water that's needed -- the underground water pipes have been laid. So the next thing is they're going to come in there I think with more soil and, you know, hopefully finish that up within -- hopefully within the next month or two. So that is progressing along nicely. Work with city administration to ensure the walkability study continues to be a priority and ultimately review the recommend ations to determine what makes the most sense for the future of Downtown Scranton . That's progressing . On June 21st, Jeff Spec is going to be at Lackawanna College . And I believe that's at 6 p.m. He's the gentleman from I think the Boston area that is running that walkability study. So that's going to be open to the public. I believe it's 6 p.m., Lackawanna College , June 21st. I mentioned this earlier , work with city administration and Scranton School District to identify nonprofit s throughout the city and actively seek additional payment s in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 lieu of taxes to improve both city and school district contributions . Part of that had to do with the HUP test. And, you know, as I said, that's coming back -- the RFP on June 8th. Also, there was a meeting with the solicitor s and engineers recently . So that is progressing . Oh, excuse me, that's stormwater issue. I was told that -- this has to do with the HUP test as well, but on June 5th the Scranton School District is going to be hiring a development coordinator that's going to work in conjunction with this HUP test and really kind of focus on non-profits and really try to seek additional funding -- payment s in lieu of taxes. Work with the administration to get regional stormwater authority up and running. That's the one where solicitor s and engineers have recently met and that is progressing . So we're ultimately going to get to a stormwater authority . But there is some legal things that need to be addressed . Work with administration and Council Solicitor to review and update the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 Administrative Code. That's still not as far as I would like it to be. But the Mayor and the Solicitor are aware that that's a priority . I spoke with them about that today. And then work with the administration to ensure that new Rental Registration Inspection Program is institute d. That will go live June 1st on the website . Postcard s are going to be going out to all landlord s. So that's a five month update on some of those things that I had indicated I was hoping to accomplish from this seat. And, you know, on a final note, I realize that we're not perfect . We don't always have all the answers that everyone would want. We try to get the answers as much as we possibly can. Sometimes people want things that we can't deliver on. But I will tell you that we take the job seriously . Just from the comment s that you heard in Fifth Order, a lot of what goes on in City Council persons happens outside of these chamber s. We're constantly on the phone, getting text messages , e-mails, meeting with people, constituents . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 And we try to do our very best to address the needs of the city. And in the meantime , many of us sit on other committees as well. So we do the very best we can. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
