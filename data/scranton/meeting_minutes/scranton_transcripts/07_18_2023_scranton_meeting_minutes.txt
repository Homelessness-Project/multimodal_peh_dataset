CONTROLLER ’S REPORT FOR THE MONTH ENDING JUNE 30, 2023. MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I got a few comment s, same comment s I had in our previous caucus. I'm looking at 3-A, the overtime report. I did notice that refuse overtime was the highest since January . At that point in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 time we probably had some weather occurrences . I am looking forward to Rubicon and the City Refuse Coordinator coming in to give us a review of what's going on. Last week or the week before I did ask a question about the smaller trash trucks, didn't get an answer but the response that we got was that we were advised that the administration is schedule d to speak about Rubicon and how the collection is going so far. So they're just -- although we didn't get an answer about the smaller trash trucks and the trips to the landfill , they will be in to explain that so something just to point out there. And Mr. King said 3-C, our payroll preparation tax is a little short this month. Hoping to see that come up. And two things that I had for Mr. Voldenberg during caucus was we had 3-H and the Controller 's report, Bread Basket of NEPA. Money for this organization come out of the community center line item, so just looking into the justification for why money came out of the community center line item for that organization .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 And then Rubicon was also on the Controller 's report for this month. And Controller Murray had asked several questions about the scope of their work that we're looking to get some answers and hope to get those answers soon regarding that contract . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Any other comment s on Third Order items? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a comment on one of the code enforcement complaint report. And there's a number of the properties on there, some of them from 2022. So I wonder if they could clean up the list or got the current status of the properties . And one of them in particular there's been complaint s about since and I'm wondering where it stands is the 708-710 Harrison Avenue which is an empty overgrown lot that's been a problem for years. And it sounds like it was with the magistrate . I'm not sure what happened from there. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you would be able to check in on that specific property for me and then if we could take a look at some of these other outstanding ones. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, when we're looking at the list, I mean, a lot of properties go in. I notice they don't show up on the list or the list doesn't seem to be up-to-date. That was something I talked about a couple caucuses ago. But I'm not sure how they get onto this list, how they're process ed through the list. Even the one that I've had several complaint s about is the 1600 of Hawthorne Street. It also has the magistrate as Ware which is incorrect . MR. KING: Okay, if there is no further comments on Third Order items, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SMURL: Just one, Weston Field I believe the pool opened today finally . The final repair was done to it. And now that's open, I know the bathhouses and stuff down there are -- I believe are going to be demolished . I hope we don't move forward on any of that stuff until the end of the pool 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 season so if the pool does stay open for the rest of the summer, we don't close it because of any other reasons . MR. KING: Frank, can you inquire with Scott -- is it Frank Gassenmeyer , Parks and Rec to find out what's going on with that with the bathhouses, what the timeline is? MR. VOLDENBERG : He advised me that it's with OECD at present so I'll follow up with both. MR. KING: Okay. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few announcements to make if no one else has any. So this weekend at Nay Aug there will be a carnival for kids. That's going to be hosted by Children 's Advocacy Center. I think it's the first year that they're doing it at that location . So that will be exciting to have them there at Nay Aug. And so there will be carnival food, treats, games, prizes, arts and crafts, pony rides, bounce houses, basically everything . That will be great to keep kids entertained . So that will be taking place this Saturday from 12 to 4 p.m. at Nay Aug. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 And then the Friends of the Poor opened a satellite food pantry and that's going to be located at the Holy Rosary Center on West Market Street. And that will be taking place every third Thursday from 2 to 3:30 p.m. starting on July 20th. And the following weekend , June 29th that Saturday , there's going to be a craft fair at Nay Aug. There's going to be 5-K. There will be a lot of different events going on that day from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. That's going to be to help raise money for the butterfly playground they've had for a few years now. So that will be taking place the following weekend . And then there will also be St. Joseph's Center Festival that will be at Marywood from Friday the 28th to Sunday the 30th, Friday and Saturday from 4 to 10 p.m. And then that Sunday will be from 12 to 7 p.m. So a lot of good summer events and festivals going on. MR. KING: Thank you. Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : No, I don't have anything . Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : I do have one. I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 told today that the North Scranton Hometown Heros banners will be going up and installed this Wednesday and Thursday . And 227 banners throughout North Scranton will be hung for the Hometown Heros. That's all, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Just a few things, I was happy earlier tonight during our caucus we had our new auditing firm, CLA, which is CliftonLawson and Allen come in and report to us along with Matt Domines ' and Eileen Cipriani . It seems like they are off to a good start. We'll know for sure when the deadline hits for our audit. It sounds like they are pretty confident they're going to be able to deliver it on time. So that will be the first time in quite some time. So we're looking forward to that. Also, the 117th Waldorf Park German Day is scheduled for Sunday, August 6th from 1 to 6 p.m., at Waldorf Park. It's generally a good time. So we remind everybody to come up and attend that. Also, since we're going to be off all of August, I just want to remind everyone on Labor Day weekend we have the huge 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Italian festival in downtown Scranton around the courthouse square. So we hope people can get out and enjoy that. I'll also announce that I will be participating next week but I will be participating by phone because I'll be away. But I will be able to participate in the meeting . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN S PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton , last week you told me -- you gave me some information about why we don't have the delinquent property tax database on the City's website , some of the answers . But I don't know how -- how much that satisfies me since all of those answers apply to the delinquent refuse database which is on the City's website , which is only updated once every quarter which contains the names, addresses , and delinquent status of various citizens . So what is the difference between the refuse database and the property tax 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 database ? The same argument should apply to both, so either no database should be on the website or both should be. That's my opinion . What is the status of the arbitration on the police union contract ? MR. KING: It's still status quo. I think it's right down to the lawyers on both sides. So they're expecting it to be wrapped up shortly. MS. HODOWANITZ : I'm sure Mr. Ufberg is happy because in the month of June he got paid $49,000 for his contribution . Also in the June Controller 's report I see that Rainey and Rainey, the firm that was hired for two years beginning in 2015 to ensure that the audit would be done on time got paid $4,400. God only knows what they are doing upstairs , but they're not getting the audit done on time, at least they haven't in the last seven years. And then something strange and odd, when you see these resolutions reappoint ing or appointing someone to one of the authorities , you'll see a memo from I think it's usually Brittani Hammer to Andrew Cutillo , Deputy City Solicitor . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 So it sounds to me like he's an employee . Yet in the Controller 's report under Law Department Professional Services his name pops up as it has in the past for $1,500. So is he a paid employee or what is his professional service he's being -- he's providing . I could understand if it was training or a conference or something , but it's kind of odd. It's not the first time his name has popped up. So see if you could find out why or what that professional service was because he should be paid as a salaried employee and I don't understand what this is. Let's see, July 17th and 18th Pennsylvania 's declared a code orange for air quality . And we still haven't heard from the city what their plan is should we ever get down to a code red. Have you heard anything through the Mayor about for a plan for code red? MR. KING: I have not recently , no. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Let's see, I was hoping that maybe our public health coordinator Dr. Saxena would have some input. DR. ROTHCHILD : We were given 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 something late this afternoon . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, good. Item 5-I, the community wide health and safety landscape assessment which was being awarded to Muflehun $69,000. That is another public health issue that I would hope that she was involved in since it's health and safety. And also in the newspaper recently a story on the city's climate action plan for greenhouse gas reduction and reduction of heat islands in the city and related public health issues. These are all items that Dr. Saxena should be involved in. And I see no feedback to the citizens , not only on code red but some of these other issues. It would be nice to know what she's doing for that $120,000 a year and that the Mayor wants to make it a permanent position . And if you could in Fifth Order give us an update on the pocket park. I was very happy to see CLA come in and speak openly about their audit. And I will personal ly erect a statute to CLA if they get it in on September 30th or sooner. If they don't, 10 percent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 penalty . MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Scott Thomas. MR. THOMAS: Hi. I'm Scott Thomas, CEO of the Scranton Public Library . I want to thank you for your help in getting the no parking sign moved by the Albright Library . Our people come out and but books in our book drop. So we appreciate that and also the authority appointment s that are on the agenda. We also -- I also wanted to voice our support for Item 6-C which is the Marion Street rerouting and one way. We -- our Nancy K. Holmes branch is one block away from that intersection . And we've long been concern ed about the safety there. And I got a petition together there last year for that. So we're happy to see that that's being taken care of. So thank you for that. And I'm hoping that 7-C will allow the green to go grant that the city got to upgrade the traffic signal and the crosswalks at the corner of Wyoming and Green Ridge Street where our branch actually is to get those upgraded. I know that's been around for a long 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 time. So I'm hoping that legislation will do that. So I just want to put that out there. So thank you very much. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . There are several things that I would like to cover. And I'm going to give this to Council and then I'll discuss it. What I've given you is something regarding the bathrooms in this facility . Since the very first public restroom s were built it's been standard practice to have one for females and one for males. For more than a century everyone seemed pretty happy choosing between a women's room and men's room. Now, gender neutral bathrooms as the only bathroom s in the company are a very bad idea. They work for almost no one. Gender neutral bathrooms along side the standard male and female bathrooms are a good idea. They work for almost everyone . So what I'm saying is here in City Hall if you want gender neutral bathrooms , you have to put a separate one in and leave it for men and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 women. That's our choice. The fact that many people find it extremely stressful to share a public bathroom space with people of the opposite sex, you're in there using the bathroom and women come in there or vice versa is very uncomfortable . What I gave you is a whole outline , Mr. King, regarding everything that it takes, the laws and everything related to gender neutral bathroom or regular bathroom is what we need in the facility . Now this facility on this floor you have unisex bathrooms . And yet on the third floor and the first floor they are designated men and women as they should be. There's urinals , everything as they should be, proper stalls, proper things. Yet on this floor we don't have that and that's a joke. Either you make them all the same or you don't use them at all, one or the other. I don't want to go back. I've travelled all over the world. I've been in third world countries . We don't like what we're doing here, put a hole in the ground, put a hole in the floor. We'll use them. That's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 where you're taking us backwards. We're not going forward . We're going backwards. A while back Bill Gaughan made some comments . He called me an ignorant fool. Name calling can't (inaudible ) the rules here because of the related to Rothchild -- called me a week-minded bully, disgusting and disgraceful comment s, uneducated venom. This came from the Council President who's in a federal lawsuit with me right now because I (inaudible ) for people like that who have contributed nothing and they want to live off the system and make comments . I donated as I told you disinfectant wipes to child outreach here, a total of $50,000 worth between Trump and myself. Yesterday we donated $5,000 to the Friendship House of disinfectant wipes. I could ask Jessica here could she -- my physician 's out of the country right now. Could she write me a prescription for dicyclomine ? It's for heartburn. Can you do that as a doctor? DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm a doctor of physical therapy . So I don't write 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 prescription s. MR. BOLUS: That's right. You're a physical therapist and I've always -- DR. ROTHCHILD : (Inaudible .) MR. BOLUS: Yeah, but you can't write a prescription . That's what I'm getting at. DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, but I earned a doctorate . It's a doctor -- MR. BOLUS: I understand that and I want to make it clear -- DR. ROTHCHILD : We've gone over this a lot of times and I -- MR. BOLUS: I want to make it clear. (Inaudible due to cross talking .) MR. BOLUS: If we go back a little Jessica who had a passion for (inaudible ) when she founded her school's first LGBTQ student organization . And what I want to bring that up, I'm a Catholic . The University of Scranton is a Catholic Jesuit school. The violation in the Catholic law is sex is a man and a women. I'm requesting that the University of Scranton lose their tax exemption status because they are a Catholic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 University and they violated the rule of law. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. MR. BOLUS: And that's what I want to bring up here. MR. KING: Ron Ellman. MR. BOLUS: And I understand -- MR. KING: Thank you. Your time is up, sir. MR. BOLUS: If I could have one second more to say something else if it's not a problem , I want to talk about something about the (inaudible ) satisfaction which one resides is the other -- men walking nude with an erection in a parade with children and people around is a total violation of law enforcement indecent exposure , yet they are never arrested. And it's time we all take a stand as we are because we're not all part of the -- MR. KING: Ron Ellman. Thank you. MR. BOLUS: And I'm sorry if it offends somebody here, but we do have that right. MR. KING: If offends a lot of people. Thank you. Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: I got to finish my Rolo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 up there. Good evening , Council . First off, again, I realize there's little patriotism or devotion to our country presently due to the policies of this White House. Last week some Biden bureaucrat ordered the needless unnecessary destruction of a bald or American Eagle. This is a standard -- this is a emblem of our country . Right there behind you is one on that pole. I am a real animal lover. And a couple years ago I found a pigeon on the sidewalk . I ended up taking it to Stroudsburg because I thought it was dying. Actually there wasn't nothing wrong with it when I got it there. But this destruction of a symbol of America is no different than somebody grabbing that flag and shredding it in front of people in my opinion I guess anyway. I realize there is plenty of people out there that have no feeling for the flag anymore. I can't imagine who gave somebody authority to destroy a beautiful animal like this, some cretin in government or somebody is just a contemptible vile act. And it doesn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 seem like people care. I did see it on the news but it looked like a veteran's group or somebody would have some comment on such a despicable occurrence . It's an example . It's epitome example of the abuse of someone 's power and authority in their position . I'm not attacking you, Mr. Smurl, in the least bit. But you never came to meetings . And the first act that you did was destroy the slide at the swimming pool that wasn't bothering . It wasn't any expense . I never -- I'm not the only one. This was a needless waste of city property and money. Now it seems like it could have fit in eventually . I was told -- I've only seen it from a distance . I was told there wasn't a thing in the world wrong with that slide by several people that I see at Weston Park that knew about it. Well, I also saw in the paper this week that the Mayor and Miss Lizzy declared Christmas in July for downtown , 75 retail businesses and 50 cafes or restaurant s and pubs and so on. Another example , the whole city out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 there is hurting and everything goes to downtown . Miss Lizzy thinks that she declares these businesses are -- need support and Groove Brewery was given $70,000 a few months ago. And last week they got over 83,000 more. That doesn't seem like a small business in need of financial aid to me. There's little restaurants all over this city, these small business es that could use the financial help a lot better than they're dwelling out according to the paper last month. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Len Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Good evening, Council , Lenny Srebro. I'm a resident of Keyser Valley, the flood prone area. I'm wondering did we get any information since last week I was here or a couple weeks ago? MR. KING: We did get a report. I think I announced this last week that regarding North Dewey Avenue and Lafayette Street, is that -- MR. SREBRO: Yes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. KING: The city public works director advised that DPW will place the drainage issue on their list and schedule as time and staffing permits . So it sounds like they are aware of it now. They have it on their list and expect to address it ASAP. MR. SREBRO: Okay. Those picture s are immediately around my house and around the neighborhood there. You'll see the drainage ditch. You know, to see that reply that you just gave me sounds like the same thing that I heard for years, you know, but what's really going to get done about it. You know, it's they're going to look at it. You know what I notice that flood control trucks come by. They only come by after a storm is over, you know, and eventually it does drain. You know, so they see -- and I'm sure they put in their report that it's draining . But, you know like, somebody should really come out there in the midst of the storm. And it's unbelievable now that the drainage that comes down the streets as you could see in the pictures , you know, like, now 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 it's like boulders come down. It's rocks. You know, it's not just dirt and debris. I don't know where they are coming from further up the line. But, man, I'm telling you it's unbelieva ble the real debris that comes down. You know, with this new Council since I've been coming here -- jeez, I sure hope you guys do something more than the old Council . That's all I could wish for. And in the past, you know, I rounded up the neighbors numerous times to come here and back up what I say all the time. And that's been over 25 years people have been coming here. And they say, Len, I don't want to bother anymore. They don't do nothing . And you're wasting your time going there. Well, about 10 years now so far the people are right. Now I understand why neighbors don't want to come out. The storm drains that are up above me, you know, I don't -- I don't really see them even doing anything , you know, because -- immediately when there is any -- it doesn't have to be the storms like we've been getting .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 It could just be heavy rain and they back up so quick and then here we go. The whole neighborhood floods up. Also, this drainage ditch that runs into that drainage -- the 36 inch drainage pipe, the foliage is grown so over from that ditch. You know, I'm hoping that somebody could from the city, DPW could come and cut back some of that foliage because it's hanging over the road about a quarter of the road. So now any traffic going through there, they're driving on my lawn, you know, to avoid running into trees and everything else. These nasty storms that we just had recently , I just wish one of you guys would come out there and just see what it's like in person. You know, I really need to get a new truck. My old truck is giving me all kinds of problems . But I was thinking instead of getting a new truck maybe I should get a boat. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Srebro, just so you know, I am one of your neighbors . I live in the Keyser Valley. And several of these storms I have been down through by your house. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 I've seen the water come up because it comes up out of the sewer in your area. I think it's because they've been disconnect ed from the sewer lines. Is there two separate lines around your home? MR. SREBRO: You know what, I don't know that for sure. But I'll tell you what, one of the really bad storms we had a couple years back it was manure and poop and everything else that was mixed in with the flooding waters. You know, so I don't know exactly what's going on, you know, as far as different drainage . I just don't know that. But some of the neighbors were complain ing about, you know, there's turds running down the street. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I've seen it. It comes down the river. It goes right down Cameron Avenue like a river almost out to Jackson Street. MR. SREBRO: That's right. MR. SCHUSTER : And then the roads behind it the dirt -- well, I don't know if it's a dirt road but it seems to be a dirt road closer to Lackawanna baseball field there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 like a swamp in there when it happens . I do know DPW is working on some of the areas up there. And there were some studies that were done last summer. I'm hoping to see some improvement s in the area as well. MR. KING: I'm going to get these picture s down to DPW as well and ask them to get up there. MR. SREBRO: Thank you. All right. Really, I'm hoping somebody will do something than what's being done, almost nothing in the last 10 years I've been coming here. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Srebro. John Thomas. MR. THOMAS: John Thomas, Geneva House. Recently I was visiting my friend Patty Ann Xanthis , who lives on 1712 Dickson Avenue. She's been here three times and that senior high rise is almost halfway done. I was in her house. The house is literally shaking , the men working on that senior high rise. The man from the mine -- mining association said that this shouldn 't be happening next to your home. He went down her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 cellar. It's starting to crack. And he said, the only thing I could tell you is check your cellar every day and consider moving. Another thing is, once -- some of the workers said we're just doing our job. We don't think this is right. They actually told her that. There's a school up the hill on the left-hand side where she lives. They got school buses. They have teachers ' cars. When that high rise is built, you're going to have to a traffic jam like you wouldn't believe . And it's an accident waiting to be happening. And I don't know what to say. MR. KING: Mr. Thomas, where is this? MR. THOMAS: 1712 Dickson Avenue. MR. KING: 1712 Pittson Avenue? MR. THOMAS: Dickson Avenue. MR. KING: Oh, Dickson Avenue, okay. MR. THOMAS: Yes. I thought she was here when this Council was -- maybe it was the last Council . I don't know. But it's like I said, it's a disaster waiting to happen. And she's -- eventually she's going to have to get out of there. But you know meanwhile, she has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 to live there with her daughter . And like I said, I was there visiting on a few occasion s. And the house is literally shaking . And like I said, once it's done because it's a narrow -- you know the streets -- it's a narrow street. You're going to have school buses. You're going to have teacher 's cars and people going in and out of the high rise. And it's not going to be too pretty. It's just an accident waiting to happen. I don't know if she was here if any of you members of Council if she spoke to you about it. Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, she's been here before about her house to speak about it. MR. THOMAS: I don't mind saying this but there was an ordinance passed that you can't build a high rise next to a person's property . They changed -- they started building the high rise. A couple weeks later they changed the ordinance . If they waited just before that high rise started being built, that wouldn't be built. And I'm a little suspicious about that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 And I don't want to mention any names because I don't want a lawsuit . Of course, they wouldn't get any money if they sued me. But there's a couple people -- well known people in this city is involved in this high rise -- building this high rise. Like I said, I can't prove it. I can't mention any names. But it's all going to come out if an accident happens. And then it's going to be too late. On a lighter note, on the corner of Penn Avenue and Linden Street, as you know there was a shoe store. They tore that building down. Do you have any idea if anybody is going to go -- what's going to be built there? Is there any kind of interest there? MR. KING: I don't know that at this time. We could inquire . I'm not sure who actually owns that property . We'll look into it. MR. THOMAS: It's only my opinion . I think it's great that we have a lot of young people in town now because I live in town now for 10 years. But there's one thing I don't like because I live in town. We don't need any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 more banks and we don't need any more hair salons. Thank you, Council . Have a good evening . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Thomas. That exhaust s the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else anyone else like to speak? Sir? I'd ask you to please state your name and your address . ERIC: My name is Eric. First and last name or first name is okay? MR. KING: First name is fine. ERIC: My name is Eric. I live at 1310 North Washington Avenue in the city. Permit parking is a very big issue over there. I'm here today to address that. First of all, it's ridiculous . There is -- first of all, there is suppose d to be a permit from my understanding from talking to the parking people who hand out the tickets as well as the Scranton Police Department who say they have no control over withdrawing tickets or anything to do with the tickets. They are just basically enforcing it from the sergeant that I spoke with at 3:00 today. MR. KING: Where is this, Eric? ERIC: This is on the 1300 block of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 North Washington Avenue. I have a pass that I purchased . And I've gotten a ticket today. So it's ridiculous that we're getting -- first of all, my mom has owns the property . My brother lives upstairs . She lives downstairs . It's a two -- double building . We should not be getting ticketed. We have passes. We have permits . We should not be able to -- we shouldn 't have to pay to park in front of our own house. The prison guards right in front of the prison I took picture s before I came to this meeting . I'm trying to find out if only one side is permit parking or if both sides of the 1300 block of North Washington Avenue are permit parking . I know my brother had reached out to somebody within City Hall here. They said if we petitioned enough people on the block which mainly that block, I mean, you have three people who actually own their properties . The rest of the block is rental property . But we're trying to figure out why we keep getting ticketed, why we have to go to the magistrate to dispute it when I know several prison guards who have gotten 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 ticketed and their -- they didn't make it to the magistrate . It was dismiss ed before they went to the magistrate . I keep getting told, oh, just go to the magistrate , just go to the magistrate , the magistrate . As long as you got a ticket the magistrate will dismiss it. Well, that's tieing up the courts. Why do I want to tie up the courts? Why do I want to miss work to go to a court hearing to show that I have a pass and the magistrate is just going to dismiss it? It's ridiculous . MR. KING: So you are saying that the 1300 is permit parking. You have a permit but you are getting ticketed. ERIC: Correct . All of our cars are getting ticketed . And it's ridiculous . It's really ridiculous . MR. KING: So you are displaying your permit in your window and -- ERIC: So today it is my fault that I forgot to put the pass in the window and why I got a ticket. But we're not new to 1310 North Washington Avenue, apartment one or two. I've had the same car for four years. My mom's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 lived there for seven. Both Kelly -- actually I know her by name because her grandmother lives right next door to me, the one parking lady. And then you have the other man who I think actually used to work in licensing , inspection , and permits in this department and just went over to the parking authority part of it or whatever . I mean, we're not new to that area. You've seen my car there time and time again. You know I have a pass. You know I've bought passes in a the past. Why do you keep ticketing us? You should be ticketing the prison guards who don't reside in the city, who just work there as prison guards. You know, we shouldn 't be getting ticketed as city taxpaying resident s. First of all, we shouldn 't even have to pay in front of our house but that's another matter. I'm just frustrated . My mom is frustrated. Right now we have $100 in tickets , $25 every time we don't display or whatever in front of our house. It's ridiculous . It really is. I mean, I think everybody here in this room would probably agree that it's real 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 shitty -- excuse my language -- that you have to park -- pay to park in front of your own home. That's crazy. MR. KING: I think probably the reason that it's permit parking , I'm sure the neighbors came and petitioned the city to make it permit parking . So it's kind of like a difficult situation where they wanted it and now you got a ticket and you didn't have the display and -- ERIC: But for the last seven years that we've lived there it's been permit parking . I mean, I don't see any of the same people moving in and out and all the time in the city, you know what I mean, so therefore -- MR. KING: Perhaps you go to your neighbor s and see if you could get a petition to see if you could get the permit -- ERIC: And how do I start that process , sir? MR. KING: Start knocking on doors and get a petition signed. ERIC: I could type up something legally combined and I could get that -- I could -- everybody to sign it in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 neighborhood . MR. KING: And then you could present it to the city. ERIC: And how about just one more thing. The parking signs, I believe every sign it's suppose d to be a permit parking every other pole a sign is supposed to be on. There is no -- the pole before Nicholas 's Pizza has a sign that says no permit parking but everywhere else there is two signs on that block total that say permit parking . MR. SCHUSTER : I'm looking it on Google maps right now or Google street view. There are permit parking on every other pole down that block. The length of that block has four poles. There's two permit parking on your side of the street and there's also two on the opposite side. ERIC: Those signs are no longer there. I have picture s of it on my telephone in my -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, because the one is in front of the house directly next door to you. ERIC: Yeah, there's no sign there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Like, you could have the DPW guys come out, police come out, the city. You guys could drive by. MR. SCHUSTER : From this on the computer though, there are four signs within that block on both sides and to answer your question previous -- ERIC: Yeah, I've only counted for two -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, both sides of the street are permit parking . ERIC: Okay, so, yeah, there's no signs at all that say permit parking in front of the Lackawanna County Prison. Can I actually show you guys real quick or -- MR. KING: I think he has it up here. I'm looking at it right now. MR. SCHUSTER : That is not North Washington though. What street is that one? (Inaudible .) MR. KING: We'll inquire on, number one, with the signs; and number two, if you're no longer interest ed in having permit parking there, then typically the citizens in those neighborhood s would sign a petition asking to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 have that permit parking . ERIC: How many people have to sign it? MR. KING: I don't know. It's good if you could get the vast majority of the people. ERIC: I plan on coming down to the Mayor's office tomorrow . I spoke with the sergeant and everything . MR. KING: Okay. You could do that as well. But I would encourage you to -- they are going to tell you to get a petition . ERIC: But again, how many people have to sign it? MR. KING: I don't know that answer. I would think the vast majority they would want. You know, if two people sign it and there's 15 people that live on the block, they're not likely going to change it. ERIC: Okay. MR. KING: Okay? Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. King, we'll provide Eric with a petition if we could have his address . MR. KING: Eric, Mr. Voldenberg is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 going to actually give you a petition . MR. VOLDENBERG : If you give us your address . MR. KING: Thank you. Mr. Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I see tonight on motions B that we have the fire ordinance coming up again, the open burn. Understand last time this got voted down. One of Dr. Rothchild 's comment s for it was, it kind of goes against the idea that protest s are organic. I also have a question about that because when a policy is defeated by this body, as far as I know the next session it can be brought up for revote. Anything that is physically struck -- voted down by this body is not suppose d to be reintro duced by the code, by the ordinance of this city until the next calendar year. It was defeated in this year. This shouldn 't be before this body until next year. So someone who is a really wanting this to go through really needs to (inaudible ) until January because it's improper to push this through right now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 In the last couple sessions ago you mention ed there was -- Mr. King, you mention there was a special session that was held. And you noted that the case number was three. You paused and then you said 202 CV 01172. And it was dealing with the open burn. When I went down to actually research that, that docket number does not exist. So if you can get me the number I would appreciate it because that does not seem to be the correct docket number. MR. KING: I'll have to double-check that number that I gave you. Sorry. MR. COYNE: No problem . Pilot list, I asked for a list of pilots that have been sent out by the city and if we got any response . Supposedly there's been a list that the Mayor's office has been aggressively putting out requests to the organizations for pilot. Have we gotten the list back of who they sent those pilots to, those pilot request forms to? MR. KING: Frank, did we receive anything ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We have not. I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 reach out. MR. KING: If you would, thank you. MR. COYNE: All right. Going onto the city health coordinator . I know she puts up links. I know that or has the IT Department put up links for people to look at. I know that she goes and takes stuff from federal sites, pamphlets and has them posted for employee s because obviously those informational pamphlet s from HUD or from the CDC can't be found anywhere else and need to be pulled by a $120,000 per person to be put up on the website to say, look, I'm doing something . My question is, rather than going out to these Mayor health meeting s and talking about cigarette smoking , alcohol use and Narcan, has she gone out and actually visited the homeless ? Has she gone to the food shelters ? Has she gone to soup kitchens ? Has she actually gone out to the public who is impacted by health concerns , not a little fair but actually gone to them where they live, St. Francis , and actually talk to people down there who suffer in the cold in the winter and in the dust.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Health coordinator should not be an office job. It should be out with the public as well. How are these homeless people going to get the web pages? How are they going to look up the information for when a code red is? As far as I know, the homeless down there don't have internet connection s. And the trees that are next to their camps don't allow you to print out paper. I know it's wrong that the trees just aren't being technologically helpful , but these people are abandoned out there. And the health care coordinator is suppose d to be doing that. And last, you keep saying talking to the Mayor. City Council by the charter owns public health, not the Mayor. Why does this body refuse to act on public health which is its specific domain by the charter ? Can you tell me, Mr. King? MR. KING: I don't think there is anything in there that says we can't work through the city to help make that happen. MR. COYNE: No, it says yours is to legislate it. You own it, not work through . You own it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. KING: Okay. Well, one of the things that we did since we own it, I don't think I was on Council at the time. They appointed a public health coordinator to help address that. MR. COYNE: Why isn't she under this body rather than the Mayor because health is this body, not the Mayor's. Again, passing the buck. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Virgil Argenta . Have we got the status on the Theodore Street bridge by the city engineers ? Does anybody know if they went out there and checked on that? MR. KING: Frank, did we get an update on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : First, it's being addressed by for Norfolk Southern as far as the railroad bridge goes. They are going to report back to us, the regional bridge supervisor . MR. ARGENTA : So our city inspectors didn't visit the bridge? MR. KING: They're scheduled to visit -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 MR. ARGENTA : My next question , the inventory list of the city-owned properties , I'm asking for those city-owned properties and that list because Jessica continuously asks about properties . We need to know on these vacant lots if they are owned by the city and if they are not and if they're the city's property we need to hold the city's feet to the fire. That is the reason why I want that list. This is my fourth week in a row that I asked for the list. Also, an inventory list of city owned vehicle s and if their -- list is broken down by department . And if so, may you provide a list of all police vehicles including the year, make, milage and conditions of the vehicles . And do we have enough equipment afforded to the city police in the event of a crisis? Can you provide the staffing level in the police department ? What is the number of officers needed in the police department to operate the city safely for the men and women in the department and for us, the citizens ? How short staffed is the police 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 department ? What is the plan of the city administration to bring it to a full staffing level? And if we are short, how are we covering up to make up for the shortage s? Are we overworking these police officers ? You know some of the things you see you can't unsee. We have ten new vehicle s for code enforce ment. And it's fair to say we have ten employees for that department . So that's the reason why I'm asking about the police department and their vehicles . I think we have that a little bit backyards . The police department should have the new vehicle s and the police department should have the ten new employees . And if there is police officer -- police vehicles left over, we could get the police vehicles to code enforcement to use. Wrapping up a police, painting up a police car, doesn't make the police car any more efficient . Do we have a daily product log or a status report, any of the calls and complaint s that the code enforce ment crew responds to and how those ten new cars and ten new employees contribute d to the city in a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 positive way? Are there any reports on any fines that they have collected ? Is the ten cars and ten employees worth their weight in gold? Would it make sense maybe to piggyback from other department s and maybe help the police department get some vehicle s that kind of work and are road worthy? How about the status of the Serrenti Center? Is there a chance that the public would be able to tour it? After all, us taxpayer s are the investors of that city project . So the status of Weston Field, again it's open. The building is ready to collapse . You have porta potties . Let me ask you something , Mr. Smurl. That's your gig. Is there any running water at the porta potties ? Is there any running water at the pool area? Mr. Smurl, should there be running water? MR. SMURL: Are you asking if there is running water at porta potties ? Is that what you're asking? MR. ARGENTA : If you have the facilities there and the changing rooms and bath areas for the shower, there's running 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 water. You put porta potties up. Is there running water? Is that a health problem ? Is that an issue? You are in charge of that. You're the pool cheerleader. How is the pool? Is it safe or do you just do this because it's the right thing to do? The building is ready to collapse . Would you sign off and be personally liable because you're part of that department ? If something happens when that building collapses , are you liable and the city liable or is this just a big smoke and mirrors to open up the pool. We got three weeks left of summer before the kids go back to school. Are you ready for the liability ? Bottom line, the question is, should there be water at the pool with the porta potties with the changing rooms, period. Is there running water? And if not, that's a health violation . And you know that as well as I do. The homeless are still running rampant . The guy that escaped from the prison on the murder was found in a homeless camp. We don't know who is in the city. It's not fair 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 for our police officer s to have to go down into a homeless camp and not know what they are up against . It's not fair for any one of us. When are you going to address the homeless issue? I've been here week after week after week after week. If it's the railroad 's property , then get on the phone and get the railroad police down there. If it's the county's problem , get on the phone and get the county down there. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : We deserve better. And Rubicon , St. Ann's novena is in town. Is the trash pickup at the St. Ann's area for the courtesy of the novena? MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher , city resident and taxpayer . First, I would like to say that I think you have done a great job or whoever has taken Barb O'Malley on the Nay Aug recreation center. I really think that's a good selection . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 Now I'm confused . I thought that we did away with the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax and replaced it with the payroll preparation . Did we or did we not? MR. KING: Yeah, there are still some delinquent that they are trying to collect , I believe . MS. SCHUMACHER : Did you look at what is it the -- the one for the collection -- anyway -- okay, if I come back to it. I'll -- MR. KING: Under 3-C, is that what you are referencing ? MS. SCHUMACHER : No. Anyway but what's -- it's still saying Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax. Okay. Back to Meadow Brook two, do we have any more rights of way? MR. KING: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. MS. SCHUMACHER : I asked if we have any more rights of way for the Meadow Brook two. MR. KING: No. We can ask for an update on that on the Meadow Brook Project if we could, Frank. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Could there just be a place on the computer where that is changed as it happens instead of coming here? MR. KING: Update it with the easements , we can see if we can ask the administration if that is a possibility . MR. VOLDENBERG : It's handled through the legal department . I'll ask them. MR. KING: Thanks. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. On 7-C, why aren't we waiving what we see what you are going to do with the walkability contract ? Are we going to redo them again if they are not -- if they're not compliant with the walkability study? MR. KING: I think ultimately the implementation of the walkability study is probably going to be a year or two, three years down the road. In the meantime I think we need it would be our responsibility to make sure we take care of, you know, the lights and the traffic signals until such time as decision s are actually made about what aspects of the walkability study are going to be implemented , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 are all of them going to be implemented . So in the meantime , we have the responsibility to maintain them. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. May I ask when we are going to be able to walk into this building up and right into the center door? I mean, that -- those stairs have been section ed off for a very long time. It makes our city look like we're I don't know what. MR. KING: Can we get an update on the front steps and find out where we're at with the repairs? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information for you, sir. MR. KING: Thank you. I appreciate that. MS. SCHUMACHER : And the community health and safety and landscape , what is a landscape in this regard and how is the city going to use it? MR. SCHUSTER : Miss Schumacher , I'm not sure. That company did a study for us in August of '22. I'd like to review that study to see what kind of information they have in that study before I would move forward voting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 on this. I'm unsure what this is going to do. And it may seem that there has already been a study to do something very similar . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, that's -- yeah, I'm concerned about that. But right now I'm against it certainly . Okay. Well, I guess that will be it for this evening . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer , taxes paid for this year, by the way. I have a little information on rail bridges if somebody cares to listen. In Bradford County, it's been reapplied for -- the permit ran out. But they are building a gas to LDG plant. There will be 100 car trains carrying liquid petroleum gas and each 12 cars are the equivalent of the Hiroshima bomb. So that would be at least eight Hiroshima bombs with a little energy left over. And by the way, just about all nuclear material gets carried by and large by rail because of its heavy weight. It's the heaviest metal in the world. So that being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 said, hopefully the bridge will get fixed some day. And a comment was made about minimum wage. I have a friend at the cashier 's counter . She's 42 years old. And she got a whole 25 cents an hour raise this year. So now she makes 7.50 an hour. And I see a lot of the people that wait on me at the grocery store walking to work. They are from my neighborhood . And I recognize them as employees from this store. Grooming , you know, there's the Mom's For Liberty . And they want books banned. They don't want history to say anything that makes them feel uneasy. Science , math is a joke. They want, you know, the 6,500 years old and Jesus's carriage was pulled by a baby dinosaur . And I went to a school like that. It was a parochial school and my father became concerned about fractions . Well, I told him that the nuns spent about five minutes on compound fraction s. And he went down to talk to Mother Superior . And a day or two later an alter boy, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 an older one, walked out on the playground, grabbed me by my William King hairstyle and smashed me up the side of the head eight times and told me we're sick and tired of you, Mr. Dobrzyn . So that being said, I'll despise that school until the day I die. Now, General Dynamics parks on Mattes Avenue. So much for a bike path. Traffic signals have authority . I wish they had 24 hour cameras so if somebody tries to beat the light and knocks the hell out of my car, it's established that they are at fault. And by the way, extra time for pedestrians to cross, all ways stop. Develop ers, they are just a bunch of land hacks. The Radison was the Hilton. It was sold after grants by -- given to the Hilton. They're on Washington Avenue. They moved to the train station . They sold that, went to the corner, wound up owing us 5 million dollars , insisted that the Casey garage be torn down and the new one be built. And, you know, we're 50 million dollars in the hole over the parking garages . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 And by the way, the sidewalk cafes, I was walking past the (inaudible ) and there was a tree in the way. I had to step in the gutter. Now what would happen if somebody was on an electric wheelchair going up that street? So there are issues here. And as far as I'm concerned , you could look for absolution somewhere else, look for approval somewhere else. You'll take the blame for the developer bright idea. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council . I'm Rick Little. To quote Mr. Beale in a major motion picture called Network from the 70s where he said, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore." These are my sentiments tonight , especially when I hear all of these things that are suppose d to happen, you know, these sprinkler parks, you know, you need feasibility studies and you have to look over the health, welfare , and safety. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 I mean, why don't you just take a fire hydrant and drill holes in it and spray it out like they did on the lower east side until you get an official thing. If you are not going to build a pool, you tear down the whole pool, you know, why don't you make it a lake there like Lincoln Lake or, you know, just get three dumpsters , weld them together and make a temporary swimming pool. That would make the official swimming pool go a lot faster because it goes on for years and years with bureaucracy . And frankly , the bureaucracy in Scranton is communism . It's like top down. It's who you know. Everybody is related . Oh, it's illegal , you know, you have to check this out with the judge and, you know, feasibility studies . What we need running this city and county and state and nation is builders , people who know how to build, people that look at a problem and say, yeah, you know, let's keep the kids out of the gorge. Let's keep them from jumping into the Roaring Brook and dying, you know, let's weld three dumpsters together . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 this is the temporary swimming pool until the official one comes through . But we don't do that because we -- I only have two minutes and 50 seconds left. This is like talk back feedback with the government. We don't even have any public access television . When I first came here I wanted public access television . Oh, no, you said the word S-H-I-T on your thing. That might offend people so we can't -- now the government owns all the media. This is it, you know. So I'm mad that it just keeps going on, especially the homeless thing. And you hear people talking about the homeless . And this body is most responsible for it because you are the body that decides Scranton Housing Authority Commissioners and they've been the same commissioners for 28 years. And they -- it all comes down to what they're doing to the people in Scranton Housing Authority , which is, oh, you disobeyed your lease's terms. Well, does anybody look at the lease terms, not Judge Farrell in the magistrate court, not Judge Moyle in Court of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 Common Pleas Court because they don't even know. They don't even know about the 1951 Landlord Tenant Act. We got homeless people. I go down there and talk to them, yeah, they have SSI. But the weak link in the housing thing is the public housing because you got all of these people, all of these 5013Cs, all of these people have a job. And I got a job. I work for the department of, you know, agency of aging or health and human services . And they're trying to sell you county housing. A person can't survive on county housing . So what do they do? They go to court. They get evicted right away because that's a setup with the district attorney being the Scranton Housing Authority attorney and this judge that, you know, that he has right in their pocket and thousands of people and they are homeless . There's -- it's a shame on the city. It's been going on for decades and decades . And no one could get any information about, you know, who owns what. HUD owns Scranton Housing Authority . Well, you know, it's a complicated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 legal thing. But it's a complicated legal thing that, you know, a 70, 80 year old person or a disabled person just can't figure it out. And you ain't going to figure it out going to Lackawanna Pro Bono because they're in on it too. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: I do, Mr. King. The first one I guess Virgil is speaking about the buildings down at Weston Field. The city engineer did do an inspection on the building . So I believe if they were deemed at that point structurally unsound, I believe the city would have immediately taken them down. Just because they look terrible doesn't mean they are going to fall over and kill somebody . But I know they don't look well. But, you know, just to say they're going to fall down, that's really not going to happen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 or we would, you know, not have a city engineer . And the porta lavs, porta lavs that I guess they placed down there, I haven't looked at them. But if the porta lavs, all they require is a sanitation -- a sanitary handwashing station there. And if that is placed with the porta lavs, then you don't need running water. That is considered sanitary . All the community picnics and everything you have handwashing station . That is sufficient for the health to pass. So I hope that helps with that. The other thing is the homeless situation , the Scranton Police Department has been dealing with this constantly . I spoke to Chief Carroll about it. And I flat out asked him, you know, what are you guys doing about this? And he explained to me how they do provide the homeless people with places that they could go to. They advise them of all the health risks, especially with the smoke and stuff. But you just can't take somebody and say, okay, here's a place that you should go or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 force them to go. That's just not going to happen with these people. Unfortunately , most of these people have chosen to live outside . Some have mental health issues. Some of them fear going to shelters that they would get up beat up by other people in there. They are not allowed to take their pets in or so they're not going to go. Or they can't take their personal shopping carts with the blinds in them. So they are not going to go. I also asked them about -- I see a lot of them down there when I go by. I've never gotten out and spoke to them but most have cell phones. A lot of them have tablets. They all have ways of doing stuff. They have places to go to get their money. So think that we're going to just go down and move this camp and say -- go down tomorrow and everybody pack up and leave. Well, guess what? They're going to be two miles down the street. We'd have the same situation . So the police are dealing with this every day. They do go down there every day. They are there all the time. And stop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 and ask an officer when you see them. They do try to help these people all the time. This is through the entire country . This isn't just Scranton where homeless people come. This is -- I'm speaking right now, Virgil. MR. KING: Mr. Argenta , you continue to do this at these meetings. You're done speaking . You had your five minutes and there is no comment s. We're speaking . You're out of order. I'm going to ask the officer to remove you if you continue to do this. You interrupt these meeting s weekly. It's enough. MR. SMURL: Thank you. There are a lot of things that we can do and the city is providing the homeless people with as much as we can right now. But there are plans to do even more. But we just can't go down and push them around. They're human beings. We are not just going to take them and lock them up somewhere . That is just not going to happen. And they have the right to congregate underneath that trestle down there. They have the right to meet in small groups. They are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 not causing problem s. They are not beating anybody up. They are not setting fires. They are people just like us. So we have to do the right thing, treat them right, not just push them around or push them down the street. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : The comment s I have tonight , I guess, are going to be vehicle related comments . I did ask about the new garbage trucks that we purchased . We purchased five garbage trucks that are smaller in size. So last week I asked -- I stated I wasn't in favor of the smaller trucks for trash pickup. And I inquired if we're taking more trips to the landfill with the smaller trucks. I asked DPW management if they were seeing more trips compare d with the larger trucks in the fleet and the answer that I received was, please be advised that the administration is scheduled to speak with Rubicon about how garbage collection is going thus far. Mr. Voldenberg , I'm going to ask 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 that you reach out to Chris Smith because I didn't ask -- sorry to say this to you; but I didn't ask Rubicon how the trash pickup was going thus far. I'm asking Chris Smith how the trash pickup is going thus far and if we are seeing more trips to the dump with the smaller vehicle s. That is my first vehicle comment . MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. Schuster , they did respond that the number of trips to the landfill is predicated by the amount of tonnage legally allowed per truck. All trucks 20 and 25 yards are making two dump per visit per shift to remain within the legal tonnage . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Next, we have a new fleet of electric vehicle s. They've been travelling around the city for sometime now. Can we please ask how these vehicles are going, get a quick update how the battery life is going, does the battery sustain throughout the workday , how many times do they need to be charged , what kind of maintenance we're incurring on these vehicles ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those question s, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a couple things, someone had reached out to me 1620-1622 Pine Street. And that's an empty vacant lot. There was formally a property on there owned by Ken Bond. And that was demolished . And so the neighbor s have been working to maintain that lot and cut down the grass over the warmer months. And they were wondering if that is still the responsibility of Mr. Bond or if that's now on the responsibility of the city. So if we could find out so that the neighbors don't have to be doing someone else's work. MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe that would still be the responsibility of Mr. Bond. However , the city did place a lien on the property . I'll ask for further information . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. And I received a few responses on things, one of them was similar to the response that Councilman Schuster received from DPW because I have been asking about the trash routes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 And there are some streets that were getting missed. And they also said that they are speaking to Rubicon about the garbage collection but that if your garbage is missed or if you encounter those issues to notify 311 directly and immediately with those issues so that someone could get out to take care of them. So they provided the e-mail Scranton 311@ScrantonPA .gov and also City Hall's phone number 570-348-4100. I did also have another street to add to that list that hasn't been picked up yet to my knowledge . That is the 600 block of Duncan Street so if could you inquire about that, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And with regards to the question about code red and the air quality response , we had received one from Dr. Saxena. And what she had stated was that she has been providing public health information updates using social media with regards the Canadian wild fires and had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 provide d some additional information on air quality index ranges and the definition of the safety for orange versus red and other additional resources as well to find out about air quality , like, Airnow.gov. And there was a chart include d. The city is also installing hydration stations to address extreme heat. So I was happy to hear that. And the City of Scranton does just have the code blue for those experiencing homelessness . The wild fires are relatively a new issue to address . But it's their understanding that there are two drop-in shelter s within the City of Scranton for displaced persons and those include the Community Intervention Center at 445 North Sixth Avenue in Scranton and the Keystone Mission on 8 West Olive Street. So that is information that we received with regards to our air quality response . And also another response with regards to the public health coordinator , I do know that she's -- community health events and those have been at, like, low income -- low income housing buildings and units.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 So I feel like that is something towards the community . I don't know with regards to if she's visited the homeless shelters or homeless camps but we could certainly ask about that. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a few things. Thank you. First up, on the corner of Wheeler and East Gibson there is two stop signs that are worn. They are very hard to see, especially for people that don't live around here so they need to be replaced, okay? And then this is probably the third ask now asked of our new parks director if he got certified . He promised within two weeks. He's here two months. I know you reached out to him multiple times. Did he respond again -- did he finally respond today? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as of today, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Can you please send another e-mail or correspondence ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out. MR. MCANDREW : All right. That's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 simple ask. He promise d he'll do it. So I don't know what the problem is. And then residents reached out to me from the Oakwood Neighborhood Association . And they are asking for a status on their park which is next on the list told to them by the city engineer . This park was demoed a few years back. And they are waiting three years for this new park. Their concern is that the summer is almost over and they would like to know when they will be starting this park project up there. So, Mr. Voldenberg , would you please contact the city engineer , parks director , city administration for an update, please? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have some followup s from previous meeting from last week. Joan Hodowanitz had questions about the PPT collections update. The total 2022 collection PPT with penalty and interest is 2,248,000. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 City's target for four full quarters for PPT collection was 2.4 million . So when 2022 delinquent collections actively are being pursued by Berkheimer , 2.4 million target is very achievable . Most of the 2023 received and unposted of 149,470.28 will be posted the first quarter of 2023 PPT. Adding this to the posted $231,119.96 will put the city approximately $380,590 for the first quarter of PPT collections . It's a big improvement over the first quarter from 2022 collections . The city continue s to work with Berkheimer to increase the current quarter ly submission of PPT tax returns by businesses . Mr. Argenta inquire d about the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge. We were notified Norfolk Southern Bridge management of the reported condition of the railway bridges of Theodore Street, North Main Avenue, Luzerne Street. Michael Whitely, the Norfolk Southern Bridge supervisor will inspect and advise. Norma Jeffries , Daniel Dolan, the ABM Parking to advise on the following question 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 she had: Do the downtown kiosk shut down to payment for parking after 5 p.m.? Is there monitoring in place for ABM to respond to nonworking kiosks or does ABM respond on customer notification of nonworking kiosks only? Scott Pietreface , DPW Director will advise status of street sign project . 524 Gibson Street, our City Council 's receive d a number of complaints from neighbors regarding the overgrown dilapidated property at 524 Gibson Street. Our Council office is following up with code enforcement , OECD regarding citation /condemnation of this property . With respect to the intergovernmental agreement in cooperation with the city and the Scranton School District , there was some questions why is the full salary noted in 2023 budget for OECD? The city will pay the salary. The school district will reimburse 50 percent . What's the hiring process for the position ? The position was publically advertise d. There's joint hiring committee between the school district and the city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 Where will the person work from, the city or school district ? Employee must split time between the school district office and City Hall. Will the employee benefit s be from the city or school district -- where will they come from? The city is responsible for the benefit s and costs reimburse d by the Scranton School District . Which union will this position fall under? This is not a union position . Is the person current ly working ? No. Also, this is from our Controller John Murray. In viewing the last few City Council meetings I heard Mr. Ellman bringing up the issue of his increased homeowner's insurance and him wondering if this has to do with the impending property tax reassessment being conduct ed by Lackawanna County. It does not. The Controller indicate s that his personal homeowner's policy increase d by almost 17 percent . He inquired with his insurance company agent and was told these increase s have nothing to do with reassessment. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 As a matter of fact, they don't have much to do with an appraise d value of a home. They have everything to do with rebuilding the home if there was a total loss was incurred. From what he was told, the rising cost of labor and goods has everything to do with the increase homeowner insurance rates. Should Mr. Ellman -- so he wanted me to mention this if he had brought it up again. So I was just respond ing to that. That's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , with this resolution or this ordinance , I'm going to be a stickler. In the backup information there is a memo. It's titled Exhibit A. This Exhibit A is a memo from Jessica Eskra dated June 13. And in the resolution it states that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 Council received this memo on June 13 or on or around June 13th. Council never received this memo. I would like to make an amendment to -- let's take a look at this paragraph here. I guess I would like to make an amendment to change paragraph three to state we received the memo on or about June 18th, 2023. MR. KING: You mean July 18th. MR. SCHUSTER : July 18th, 2023, correct . MR. KING: So there's been a propose d amendment to change the language from June 13th to July 18th is when the memo was received , correct ? MR. SCHUSTER : Correct .

SCHUSTER : Correct . With that being said, this emergency situation goes back to 2018. It's been quite some time since the city has taken action on some of these project s. They did get an extension out to June of this year -- out to December 31st of this year to get these projects completed . I mean, the timing here coincides right with our break. I would have liked to have seen it at a different point in time. But I don't want to see these property owners 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 suffering with what they've already had to deal with so I will pass this into Seventh Order.

KING: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works? MR. SMURL: As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-F. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , when we look at this, there is two phases to this project . There's the feasibility piece for 25,000 and there's the design piece for $332,821. I am glad that this resolution does include both of those phases. When looking at that old study it does need to be updated and reviewed . From looking at some of the newer prices it does seem to be similar in price at this point in time. One thing that I want to point out though is it does seem to be -- normally contracts like this are a percentage of what the cost of the project is going to be. It 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 appears that this has been costed out at 4.5 percent of 8 million dollars . I don't know why we are still shooting at that 8 million dollars mark when, you know, I do think the time pool is going to be -- or this complex may be a little bit bigger than McDade. However , I think we could do it for less money than 8 million dollars . I would have liked to have seen this come in with the company deciding what the cost would be rather than giving them the cost upfront. But I hope for the best here with Nay Aug. And I would like to see a swim complex up there. That's all. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS.
