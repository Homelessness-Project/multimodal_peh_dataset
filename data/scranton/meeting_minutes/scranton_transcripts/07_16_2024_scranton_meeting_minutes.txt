LACKAWANNA COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT EVALUATION REPORTS (2) RECEIVED JULY 8, 2024. 3.B. SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED COMPARISON REPORT FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 JULY 10, 2024 AND YEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISON REPORT FOR JULY 6, 2023 TO JULY 10, 2024. 3.C. 2024 CUMULATIVE LICENSES & PERMITS REPORT AND JUNE 2024 REPORT FOR LICENSES & PERMITS RECEIVED JUNE 15, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : I just have one. The group that came in the last few weeks that have been doing the cleanup of the Washburn Street Cemetery is going to be doing another cleanup . It's going to be this Saturday the 20th. And the cleanup is starting at 8 a.m., and will end at noon if anyone would like to come out and clean up the cemetery there. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : I have an announcement . The Jewish Food Festival will be taking place at Nay Aug Park, July 28th through July 31st. And that will be from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. I look forward to it every year to go down and get some good food. You could order it in advance so you could just pick it up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 You don't even have to stay for the festival . But it's really nice. So that's held annually there. And also in line with that, there is going to be a Jewish art exhibition at the Everhart Museum. And tomorrow night is actually their opening night for the exhibition at 6 p.m. And they are having some hors d'oeuvres and things there for the opening night. But that will be on display until the beginning of October . That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So tomorrow starts St. Ann's 100th Solemn Novena, which is amazing . That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you. I just have one thing. Last night our storms that went through , I was lucky enough to have a tree come down in the 300 block of Prospect Avenue last night. And around 11 p.m., our DPW showed up, cut the tree off the street, chipped it, cut it all down, actually blew the street clean. And they were gone in about 29 minutes . So I want to thank our DPW for, number one, coming out in that storm; and, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 number two, for the great job they did cleaning that up. And I know they spent many, many more hours last night out cleaning up the rest of the city. MR. SCHUSTER : So I'll actually add to that. I was going to do it in Fifth. But I might as well do it at this point in time. Thank the DPW, the Scranton Fire Department , and the Scranton Police Department , all three of those groups were out. I took a quick ride as the storm was coming through and after it had settled . I saw all units of the Scranton Fire Department were out on the roads and doing cleanups. The Scranton Police were working some of the roads. I know Luzerne and Main Avenue, they were doing traffic lights because the electricity was out. And DPW was definitely doing some cleanups there. So all of those agencies were out and appeared to have a quick response last night. So thank you. MR. MCANDREW : And I was going to save it for Fifth also. I actually witness ed it myself the rapid response of the fire 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 department yesterday . During the horrific quick storm, a branch came down on the power line. They were there in minutes , removed it, made sure everyone was safe. And during that, of course, I saw DPW driving around and the police department . So I applaud them and their great effort yesterday . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . My running count of the collective bargaining agreements , the firefighters ' contract was arbitrated 470 days of ago, police 356 days ago. And now you have on your agenda tonight the Clerical Union contract . As you saw in the backup it is not a typed document . It's add this, delete that paragraph . So that contract is going to have to be typed. So we'll see how long that one takes. As I read through some of the changes in there, I noted things like housing inspectors would be working on Saturdays , which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 I thought was a good idea. They want to drop the residency requirement because once one union does it, which the police did, you knew that all the other unions were going to follow suit. And I saw in the backup it said for the cost, it was left blank. But among other things each member of that union would get $2,000 for 2024. And then they got wage increases from 2025 beyond. So how many people are in the Clerical Union? Anybody know? MR. SMURL: I don't know the exact amount. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Every one of them will get $2,000. So that will impact the budget this year. So if you got 50 people, that's a hundred thousand dollars . Okay, then 5-B, the repealing of the residency requirement . You know, when I first started coming to these meeting s and saw that in the Home Rule Charter , I remember thinking , well, that's a good idea because you remember Dave Bulzoni when he started working for Mayor Courtright , he never moved into the city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 And so he was literally given a waiver for years. And then you have other people who did live in the city like Mayor Courtright . Remember how he treated the city? A couple police officers who were supposed to be doing patrols and were getting paid for it and weren't, and they are paying the price for it. And there was a department head who just loved his gas card all the way to New Jersey. Remember him? So here's the thing, what I would like to see in city employees is people who know how to do their job and people of integrity that we don't have to watch them that if we turn our backs that they are going to do the right thing. What we don't need are people like our former mayor who was paying wage tax and property tax and then taking God knows how much money with the other hand, okay. I also saw in the backup for this residency requirement financial impact, none. Does that mean that people who don't live in the city are going to continue to pay the wage tax? It was not specified in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 backup. Is that what it means? MR. MCANDREW : I have question s when we get to that legislation . MS. HODOWANITZ : And have you schedule d your executive session with the administration to start asking these questions because you only have two weeks before you go on recess. So are you going to have an executive session on this matter? MR. SMURL: I would like all Council members to be here for that, Joan. Unfortunately we couldn't today. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, my bottom line is, I would rather have a Dave Bulzoni who lives outside the city and did more than anybody else to get us out of our financial troubles than to have a Mayor Courtright living in the city and ripping us off. 5-V, the appointment of Melinda Krokus to the Environmental Advisory Board, I didn't see any resume on her. And with last night's storm, was there any flooding incidents where homes were flooded ? Did we have any issues? Because , you know, stormwater is the big mountain we're trying to climb these days. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Were there any major flooding incidents ? MR. SMURL: Not that -- I didn't hear of any basements that needed to be pumped out, mostly all surface . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And I too was impressed the way the DPW, the police and the fire just nailed whatever they could. You know the power went out on the Electric City garage and the Art House Movie Theater until 2 p.m. So first time I ever saw a power outage in downtown Scranton . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . I wish Mr. King was here. I hope he could hear me because I have an issue with something he said last week. Last week he said -- he was talking about the pools and he said they're a work in progress . Well, I disagree. They are a work in regress . Progress means moving forward . We're not moving forward with the pools. These issues should have been addressed years ago. It's an example of total mismanagement by this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 administration . Now I saw in Sunday's paper the Capouse Avenue pool is being replaced with a splash pad. What is this city's infatuation with splash pads? Little children , they're okay at splash pads. Teenagers and adults, they're not going to go to a splash pad. It's ridiculous . Like I said, replacing pools with splash pads is not progress . Pretty soon they're going to be taking down the Electric City sign and putting a new one up saying Scranton , the splash pad city. Moving on, the hole on Dorothy Street was filled. I don't know how long it's going to last. But as I said in the past, the whole thing wasn't done properly because even when it was filled, that whole area around it you could see it settled . There was a dip in the pavement there. It's not even with the rest of the street. So I don't know what's going to happen. But it wasn't done well originally . And it's going to keep settling and settling . It has to be dug up again and refilled in and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 repaved. Lastly, I talked about this quite a while ago, walking around my neighborhood walking the dog when the blue recycle cans were out with the commingled stuff, it's unbelievable with the stuff I see in there. I said in the past, people have to be educated on what's recyclable and what isn't. I see lids in there from a spray bottle, the sprayers are in there. One person they put out just these big bottles with sprayers on it that you spray weeds, kill weeds. I saw one of those. Somebody put one of those in the recycling container . When the cards are sent out every year with the dates, it says what's recyclable . But they should send something separately out what's not recyclable . Lids, bottle caps, strayers , stuff like that, that is not recyclable . And I see so much of that and it wastes time at the Recycling Center. And if that stuff gets through , it breaks the machines . I was here a couple years ago when the recycling coordinator was here. And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 remember everything she said. That wasted time and, like I said, some of that stuff gets through , it breaks their machines . So I know I do it correctly . But I'm in the minority . I know that walking around my area. And I'm sure if -- it's not just my area. That's probably the whole city and that wastes a lot of time. So I hope, like I said, I hope -- my idea is good sending a note what's not recyclable along with what's recyclable . The people have to be educated because obviously a lot of them don't know what they're doing. That's all I have. Thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council , I believe President Biden's response to the assassi nation attempt was very appropriate . Now I see the phoney baloney apologetic statements of concern from a bunch of hypocrites as Mayor Paige who disgraced all Scrantonians in the past with her inappropriate behavior during President Trump's last visit here. Then we have years of people like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Sandra Meyers writing letters to the paper with nothing but hate-filled rhetoric anti-Trump, anti-Republican , nonstop . Then the repetitive bunch of fools that support her, they write a bunch of letters . I don't know when it's going to stop, but that's what incites. That's what causes people to be at each other's throat. That's all Sandra Meyers and those fools have done to this city year after year after year since Mr. Trump got into office. This is the kind of response Saturday that you get from people like this. We ought to change the climate. Has anybody wondered why the utilities are always drilling holes in all our streets ? I was walking Chumley last week and I asked they got holes all over North Main. They're looking for old sewer pipes, water pipes. There's not any records . I didn't know that. Can you imagine a city this size there's no records of these antique pipes? Did you know this? It's a shame. I don't know what could have happened to them. I guess they are just so old. And lastly, this pathetic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 excuse for a school board with this outrageous hiring, outrageous salaries for two people to assist a superintendent . This is senseless . This whole city every time you turn around we have to have a consultant or an assistant for somebody . Again, if they can't do their job, fire them and get somebody out there that can do the job. Mr. Keating, I wrote it down -- why we have these two people. Mr. Keating says these two outrageously financed newcomers here to the assistant , they are needed to create people. It says here to create a hierarchy of duties and responsibilities . In other words, it's not there now. They're going to create the reason for their positions . When is this going to stop for God's sake? You drive around this city and there is empty housing , empty lots. Like I said, my block, my one block there is an empty lot. They are rebuilding a house across the street little by little and three houses at the end of the street are vacant, just one block. You know, that's why I always say that the sour stench of graft and corruption is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 allowed here. This place is going to pot. There's no -- there is just no leadership in this city anymore or the county. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? That is all for the sign-in sheet. Anyone else? MS. KOLOSKI : Okay, Doris Koloski , Scranton resident . I just have a couple things to say. First of all, I was wondering on the 400 block -- I don't know if you have anything to do with this or not. I know it's the parking thing in the city. But on the 400 block of Colfax, the hospital has purchased all the houses on the even side of the street. And the rest of us on the odd side are very happy with our permit parking signs. And we are paying for our permit parking. We want to keep it. This is why I was hesitant to bring this up. There's two signs on the opposite side of the street. There is no houses over there so there's no residents over there. And the hospital uses it for parking and that's just fine. But because there is two signs still there, one right by the school in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 the beginning and one all the way up at the corner of Vine and Colfax on that even side that says resident permit parking , I was hoping somebody could kind of take them down because what happens is when I see somebody parking in front of my house and I tell them they can't stay there because of the permit parking , they say, oh, we were told to just ignore the signs because it's all hospital . And I think if the other side of the street didn't have those two signs, it would be a lot easier for the people to decipher that they can't ignore all the signs. So I would like to see them removed . And actually when they do remove them, I'd like to see on the other side of the street they have a thing that goes underneath the permit parking . I notice it's only on the telephone pole ones. It says resident 's parking . And we don't have any of that by me. And if you could put it on the telephone pole in front of the house next door to me 405, that would be great because instead of just saying permit parking and they think maybe it has something to do with the hospital , it would say residents 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 there, which it doesn't say. I'd appreciate it if they could do that. The other thing on my block -- and I know you guys did contact Code Enforcement because last week when I was walking up in the park with my dogs, the Code Enforcement car was coming around the park and he saw me and he stopped . And he came out and introduced himself to me. And I said, well, how do you know me? And he said, oh, I know who you are. So he asked me at that time if there was anything else on 421 Colfax there that needed attention . And I said just as far as I know aside from the grass and stuff, just the sidewalk because it's dangerous and he said okay. And that was the end of it. And I've never seen anybody else up there. I'm assuming -- I was assuming then that he didn't have people coming and that he was just checking it out. So I would appreciate if you could find out if Code Enforcement is going to do anything about it. And if they are, like, if we have any kind of timeframe . Today when I was walking Olive 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Street and Colfax Avenue again, I'll remind you about the curb cut. I know that is some kind of a problem . It's the only one that's not cut. They did cut the one on Gibson Street -- East Gibson Street and Colfax. I was assuming they did that because they were paving anyway, maybe that's why they were able to do it. But the water that everybody said was checked on, the water there where it comes up out of the sewer, it was still flooded there today and everything else was dried up already . Okay. That's it. That's all I have to say. And what I passed out to everybody were concert schedules for the Jimmy Connors 2024 Summer Concert series at Nay Aug Park. You could share them and I'm leaving a pile downstairs on the table for people in and out of City Hall. Good night. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thanks, Doris. I don't know what we could do with the parking if we could take half the signs down there. But I will refer this to our Attorney Gilbride to look into the ordinance and see if we could actually only do one side of the street. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 I'm not sure if we can. I'll ask him to look into it for us. That's why I'll have our attorney look into it. Thank you. MR. COYNE: Greeting s, Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka and citizen . First of all, I would like to ask if you have an update on the employee files being left out, the investigation . Do we have any idea what the results and recommendation or new policy may be put into place? Second, it was noted by Mr. King that the pools were in bad repair and needed to be replaced, not all at once. All of a sudden we're down to one. We will not have Nay Aug pool until 2026. The American Rescue Act of 2021 was put in place surprisingly in 2021. By April 1st of 2022 there was a final ruling along for the use of the funds for the pool. I brought it here, present ed the rulings and backups , pointed out, but Cipriani said no I believe because they wanted to use the funds elsewhere . She said we need to look for a final, final ruling and was a two year delay. If we had acted when it was brought forth, we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 would not be waiting for a pool for 2026. We would have had it completed this year. Third, two years ago I receive d a rental registration note from the city. It seems somehow a family home that was always home, never rented, mysteriously became a rental. Mr. Schuster and Mr. McAndrew also received these mailing s. There was much discourse in the body and even a request on why they were sent out and the mailing costs. This repeated again the following year somehow and President Smurl -- he instructed the people who got them in error to contact City Hall and it would be corrected . This is not an easy task as we know 311 does not return most calls. Then we have Mr. Spindler who talked about the repeated fights with the rental registration fee that he was being levied because his daughter lived in one side of the house. It took him considerable time and effort to get that resolved . During that time it seems others did not pay or never received a bill. On your financial statement you list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 rentals under Smurl, LLC., and you were an employee with 51 percent interest . I understand listing yourself as an employee in an LLC that you own and are the majority owner stakeholder as it has tax advantages as you could shift insurance and adjust your pay for best tax benefits . Who pays for what is always shiftable. What confuses me is you've always listed your rentals on the financial form. But the payment was never sent in under the rental registration . It seems one of two scenarios happened . You became a member of City Council and the rental fees stopped in one scenario . You were pulled from the list of those getting it and not billed or you decided you shouldn 't have to pay for it. A request was put in by a Right To Know on April 24th, 2024. And on the same day it seems a new bill and back bill for the prior years was generated and sent out certified mail for back years owing, the years of 2023 and 2024. And a note on that notice it says said Mr. Smurl's -- the note says the property is considered an unlawful dwelling. Being the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 majority owner and more so a Councilman , how do you remember to report rentals on the financial disclosure but forget to pay the rental registration fee? You could say you did not know the rental registration fee was due with two years of people in front of this body. You could try to shift it and say it was my partner who also took the car detailing place. He was responsible . But with your job title and being majority owner, the buck stops here. You could say you never got the bill and that this is an issue and that this issue of why you were dropped , it's odd that it only took place once you got in office. Every new employee has a check on what they owe the city. Can you explain why you were exempt or negligent for something you enforce d for everyone else and if you were indeed removed from it, why and who did the removing and under what authority ? MR. SMURL: Do you want that all now? I'll make copies for you because you're way out of line. You have no idea what you're talking about. I have everything from the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 that they did not send any of the things out. But mine are all paid and up-to-date. So -- MR. COYNE: There is your document , not up to date, not paid (inaudible ) and everything you just said there was wrong. MR. SMURL: Well, you're incorrect . MR. COYNE: (Inaudible .) MR. SMURL: Let's not go about who's lying and let's not talk about people's past. MR. COYNE: (Inaudible .) MR. SMURL: And so is yours. Anyone else? MR. MARQUIS : You know what I'm saying, peace would be a little bit nice, like, just calm down. I think you guys should get some security monitors downstairs because of everything that's going on with Donald Trump being an assassination attempt on his life and things like that, it's obvious that people get upset with you guys very -- on occasion ; you know what I'm saying? So I think that we should up the security in this building . And we should have more than one police officer back here. MR. SMURL: Anthony , speak this way, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 please. MR. MARQUIS : In case someone comes in here because people are crazy, especially in the City of Scranton . So if somebody comes up there and they take (inaudible ) people should not be able to get that close to you guys without permission . That's all I'm saying. And forgive my tone, but I'm serious about this because this should not be happening . We should have respect for our leaders regardless of what mistakes they make. Do you understand ? MR. SMURL: Anthony , Anthony , please. Anthony . MR. MARQUIS : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer , taxes paid. I'm a little concerned about 6-G and I'm willing to spend a small amount of time why the changes and what -- all it says is Surface Transportation Project . Is that road repair? Anybody know? I'm sorry if -- I'm concerned about 6-G on Seventh Order -- seven -- is it, 7-G? Okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. SCHUSTER : I think you're talking about 7-F. So it's the reallocation . MR. DOBRZYN : Yeah, reallocation of funds. Is it road repairs? What is it? MR. SCHUSTER : It's crosswalks in the city. MR. DOBRZYN : What's that? MR. SCHUSTER : Crosswalks in the city. MR. DOBRZYN : Crosswalks . Okay, well, hopefully it has a good purpose in mind. A lot of our streets , our sidewalks are broken up. And I could only imagine with what they did with my sidewalks in front of my house taking parts and throwing them on a truck and driving them off. The curbs and stuff were getting erosion and there's piles of dirt and rocks in every -- on almost every corner on Crown Avenue. Okay, a lot of stuff has happened this week. And, you know, it's just -- mind-boggling . I wish both parties would reform themselves . And we have the undemocratic part of the ]Democrat party. And then we have the 2025 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 project with the Heritage Foundation which just about total nullifies the Constitution . We have a bunch of Evangelicals pushing this. It's time they stop being tax free. If they want to get up to their eyeball s in politics , then, you know, everybody else has to pay taxes. If I want to donate to a political party I have to -- or a political representative , I have to come up with more money than a 20. I have to donate $25, pay $5 in taxes. And it's getting to the point where it's not only undemocrat ic, it's fascist . I don't need the opinions of Sister Bertha better than you reflecting on my life. And, you know, when you get so many people on the outs and possibly imprisoned , you know, it gets -- in Pennsylvania , for instance , they haven't really raised the budgets for food in prisons in over 10 years. And a recent article stated that that is now instead of $10 or $10 and some cents a day, it's $5 and some cents a day. Inmates are being served spoiled food or inadequate food. I met a person that -- was quite a few years ago. He was sent up to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 recycling center. He lost 20 pounds in 40 days. You know, so this is really getting to -- sorry about the assassination attempt but that was a Republican . The guy was registered as a Republican . So my message to the proud boys and the oath keepers , beat each other up for a change. Stop beating everybody else up. You know, it's entirely ridiculous . They want to outlaw a divorce , I mean, come on. This is -- that Heritage Foundation and I think they are tax exempt, you know, come on. Tax exempt for that, excuse me. Have a good night. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Arrogance is met with arrogance . First time I actually introduced myself to the Mayor was right here through the unhoused commission . They didn't even say the pledge of allegiance . They just went around the room talking about what they do. Now, they already know what they do. And they have no plan in sight. All right. When you don't know the city and you don't know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 its history , you don't find yourself putting yourself and finding a way to put yourself in a car seat to go to the Ritz Theater for its opening . You also try to dim the lights over the Electric City. This administration reminds me of an expansion football team, no wins in sight, no vision, no destination . Now, I've asked several questions of this Council . And it's gone on deaf ears time and time again. So I'm going to ask these questions one more time. If I don't get an answer from you and respect is earned, next week I'm going to liken this Council to a Turner Classic , the Wizard of Oz, okay? The first question is a simple one. Dom Argenta is current ly a police officer down in South Carolina down in Myrtle Beach. In a short period of time he's already consider ed a hero. He's a third generation police office who could not pass this rigged test with the Scranton Police Department . With all the money that we put into recruiting , we have a 130. And we're now down to 10, 5 or 6 will shake out. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 I want to know how important it is to you to find the right officers for the right reasons . The State Police test is something that's been used and utilized for them for decades without any problems , but yet we use something else. So I want to ask you how important it is to have a fully staffed police department with our current climate . I also want to have you bring in Chief Carroll and ask him why only five or six pass this test. All right. How do you feel about the city being down to one pool when Nay Aug opening in September of 2026? How important are crosswalks near schools , residency requirement , this residency requirement goes back to 1979 in a mandate . And after that back in the early 1990s, a court order, for a reason. We don't need to be an expansion team. We're the City of Scranton . We can do better and we will do better. Prior City Councils fired off letters for several different reasons . I'm not here for myself. I'm here also for the citizens of the City of Scranton who are sick of swerve patterns , getting out of the way of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 manhole covers and pothole s that are not our problem . There are ordinances in place. I want one of you to direct either Solicitor Gilbride who is one of the best attorneys in Lackawanna County or Mr. Voldenberg , make them famous put them on the list of (inaudible .) All right, curfew, look at Wilkes-Barre's ordinance . They have something in place. It works. All right. We have two magistrate s that I've talked to that agree, why don't we order the underage to community service . Community service is already set up through Lackawanna County. You are worried about getting sued? Come on now. You know, we could order them to work on the Washburn Street Cemetery . We're going to be there this Saturday at 8 p.m. The sewer agreement 1.9 percent a year, I asked each one of you to take a look at the sale's agreement . The increase is 6.4 percent . Each one of you spoke to people about this increase . But you're unwilling to address it. 88 percent of the storm drains are owned by PA American Water. Have them clean them out. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 like I said, I'm done being ignored . There's a lot of good people that come out here, not enough of them. But there is good people that come out here that work hard and want their questions addressed , don't do things in spite of this Mayor, do things because of her. Thank you. Good evening , City Council . MR. KING: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. KING: Nothing at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, I'm going to save my comments for Fifth Order items. MR. SMURL: Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few. First, I also wanted to make sure to thank our DPW and our emergency services SPD, SFD for their responses with the recent storms that we've had in our area. I'm hoping no one had gotten flooded out. It doesn't seem to be or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 we haven't heard of those experiencing flooding . But they were there for the trees that came down and to help out our residents . So we truly appreciate their quick responses for the storms. And I mentioned this during caucus, but I just wanted to briefly mention it here too. I have and I take issue with a couple things with the website . But one of them being with the City Council page, I find it difficult to navigate for resident s to be able to access the City Council agendas for future meeting s and the minutes for past meetings . The button for that is located at the bottom of the page and I feel like it should be higher up. And even when you get to it, the agenda for the upcoming meeting is separate and it's above. And it's just easy to miss and the layout. So I just want to work together with IT to see if we could clean that up a bit so people who aren't used to navigating it or first time visitors to that page could find 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 what they need to. I also wanted to bring up that there is some graffiti along the Harrison Street bridge and it's on the south side of the bridge. And that would be PennDOT 's responsibility so I've instructed Mr. Voldenberg to contact PennDOT regarding that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. It's a nice bridge that they just built a few years ago so we don't want that graffiti to stay on there. That's across the street from the park. And everything is kept up pretty nice along there. So I want to make sure that graffiti gets removed. And there's a street that I've talked about a lot in the past in the Hill Section , the 400 block of Prescott Avenue which I often receive complaint s about and just never seems to be taken care of. And there's several problem properties along that block of Prescott . One of them is the property I think 429 that previously had the fire and nothing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 was ever done. We thought they were going to renovate the property , didn't renovate it. And I was told it was going to demolished , still nothing has happened with it. The old Prescott bingo hall that someone I think bought that and is renovating it. So hopefully that would be nice. I know that was used for apartments . I think it will continue to be used for apartment s. But if they make that nice and the rest of the block is, you know, falling apart or other people aren't caring about their properties , how much of a difference does it make. So on the corner there is the old Vine Street station . And that's constantly having overgrown shrubbery and everything on there and it's not -- but then across the street from that, there is an empty vacant lot that has been overgrown for a long time. It also has City of Scranton barriers along it. And I'm not sure where those came from. I noticed those some time ago and I did want some more information on why they had placed those there and what's being done about that property . And I think that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 about covers it. So I'll go from there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have code enforcement follow up, Dr. Rothchild . MR. SCHUSTER : While we're on the topic of graffiti , I was informed that Washburn Street bridge also has graffiti on it. If you're sending out that other request , add that to that as well. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, a couple. At the last block on Watson Street in West Scranton is a dead end. And it's been a dead end since I'm a kid. But there seems to be issues there now. And it's also referred to as -- I don't know why, but it's referred to the 14th and 1500 block. But it's really one block, one side. So but what I'm hearing from the resident s down there is, you know, not a lot of people are familiar that it's a dead end. And that there's issues happening with trucks, some big coming down not knowing that and, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 you're trying to get out of there and causing accidents or hit and runs, you know, they're running into some vehicle s that are parked. So and there's a lot of kids down there. It's a neighborhood now where there's young kids. So could we please reach out to -- I don't know if we have to have a traffic study, but can we reach out to the proper department and ask for, like, a slow children sign on that block and, of course, a dead end sign on that block or right before. And I don't know if we need a stop sign. Maybe we'll throw that in there too when they're taking a look at it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. So speaking about streets , so I know I've been bringing this up for a while. An ordinance was passed almost two years ago for angled parking on St. Ann's Street. One block was done. It was painted . The 13 and 14th have yet to be painted. It's almost two years. I know I mentioned it recently . Have you heard anything ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as of today. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 The followup was sent but no answer as of yet. MR. MCANDREW : We pass ordinances . We got to complete the work or fulfill the ordinance . So it was also brought to my attention that the catch basin on River Street is filled and the entire area around it needs cleaning because of high grass. And, you know, also the catch basin can't function , you know, when it's filled like that and it's causing some problems up there. And it's also -- you know, I was instructed or told that, you know, this is the main entrance or one of them to the city. And it's very unsightly . I have a picture that I got. I'll send it to you tomorrow if you remind me. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few things. The first on is about the HUP test and it's process to date. This is what I received . The city contractor Rudolph Clarke, LLC, is waiting for the Lackawanna County Assessor 's Office to supply some support ing information to Rudolph Clarke, LLC, to move forward . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 So it's difficult to give a date at this time until the city actually receives this information from the assessor 's office. It says we may have a better idea when the information may be forwarded to Rudolph Clarke LLC, from the assessor 's office in the next few weeks they expect to have that. The next thing is the question on Main Avenue where they replaced the water main and when is it going to be done. It looks like it's not going to be completely finished until 2025. Steve Oszelinski is a Senior Superintendant with PAWC stated the water company engineering met with the city Thursday , July 11th and discussed plans for the restoration . Half of the project will be based in a few weeks and the second half will be based in the early fall. So the overlay of the actual street is not scheduled until 2025 due to the city also going on Main Avenue and replacing storm drains. And then once that is complete , the gas company is going to be on Main Avenue doing gas lines. So they are not going to overlay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 the entire street until 2025 when all three of these projects have been completed . The West Scranton Falcons Football Field, we sent that into Parks and Rec to find out about the damaged stairs and if we are going repair them or what's going to happen there. 402 Davis Street, the property was condemned by Code Enforcement and we've asked it to be replaced on the demolition list. 500 Davis Street, complaint s of speeding traffic and including lines they want to have done. And the police was sent to the supervisor . We asked if they could contact this resident regarding increased patrols down there and the placement of a digital speed sign. Also registered -- the registrant wanted speed bumps there. Now, naturally you can't have speed bumps in the City of Scranton or in -- on state roads. So we will not be able to put speed bumps on. And finally , this will be for -- this petty thing will be for Attorney Gilbride . I have all of the information that I've gone over with you from months ago about the problem I had paying my rental registration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 for the properties , all of the responses and when they were given to me from last year with the hundreds of other people that had problems paying their bills -- actually only rental registration bills. So I will give you this. And if you would look it over and provide all of my Council members -- colleagues with copies of it. And if we need to announce this publicly , I will also do that. But we'll take care of that with your opinion on how to handle it. That is all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – REPEALING THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT FOR CITY EMPLOYEES . MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , so when looking at this ordinance there is two things. I think it may have been conflated . Something I wanted to point out to all, it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 something that maybe the fire department doesn't know. In the backup of this legislation it states that the fire department has sent a letter to the administration to repeal residency . However , it continues to state in that backup document that negotiations are ongoing with the fire department . It goes onto state that residency is a subject for collective bargaining and that all other collective bargaining agreements that contain residency shall still be subject to negotiations . So when looking at this, it appears to me that this is only administrative staff when it comes to this legislation . So my first question is, is the city administration currently negotiating a fire contract ? It would seem odd to me that they were. We got a response on May 20th from Ufberg and Associates that the last copy of that contract was not completed and not mutually signed off -- so it would be odd that we didn't get the final version before the new contract is being negotiated . As I said before, the wording 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 appears to be referring to only those in administrative position s and not the bargaining units. I'd also like to ask where did this piece of legislation begin. Did it originate with the Law Department and come down to Council or was it something that was sent through the fire department because it appears it's coming through the Law Department . My opinion is this piece of legislation shouldn 't even be on Council 's desk at this point in time. One thing I want to point out to anybody in the audience , anybody at home, anybody that's listening , the city lost the residency piece when they were negotiating the police contract . It was something I got a few calls over the last few days. And it was something that people didn't seem to know had occurred . So with that (inaudible ) the police contract that was lost and now with the negotiation of the clerical contract that was approved last week, it was also negotiated out of their contract . So I would think at this point in time any future negotiations would side with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 that last police arbitration , if not, with that negotiation of the Clerical Union contract . Would that be right or correct , Mr. Gilbride ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Can you ask the question again? MR. SCHUSTER : When it comes to residency , any future negotiation s would refer back or side with the police arbitration when it comes to residency ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : That's absolutely correct . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so at this point in time I don't see why this would be in front of Council . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So on the question , this never should have been sent down to us. I don't like it. And I'm going to tell you why I don't like it. And, you know, in my mind, I support the public safety unions more than anybody and all the union and the hard workers of the City of Scranton . They do great work. And I'm very proud of them. But this piece of legislation leads you to believe , oh, if we don't vote for this we're not voting for the unions if we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 vote -- no, the way I look at it is -- and I took a deeper look at it that the only one that benefits from a yes vote tonight is administration hires because at the bottom the note states whether you pass this or not, the repeal of residency mandate has to be negotiated in future CBAs. So, you know, of course it looks like we're, you know, voting yes tonight and it's good for everybody . No, the only immediate benefit -- the only people that immediately benefit from this is the administrative hires. They get waivers anyways most of the time when it's sent down. So, you know, I'd like to see the process followed . I believe that the fire department -- they have to wait until the negotiations anyways to get this. And I believe they're going to get it only because the police did. And do I prefer to have a police officer live in the city and park his car in front of his house, I think that's great. But arbitration awarded them the right that they don't have to follow the waiver. And I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 fine with that because that's binding and I was okay with that. So DPW will follow the same suit. Because it was already awarded means they will get it in contract negotiations . Not say that, oh, if we -- if we don't approve this tonight , administration is going to sue or the employees that have to, you know, live in the city that work in administration . Like I said, this never should came our way. It should have worked its way out. And, of course, I have great devotion for the unions and public safety. Like, me voting no for this is not a vote against them because this process is going to happen anyways, folks. But it only immediately happens for administration who already get the waivers anyways. So this is a tough one for me. And I always explain my vote. And that's what it is. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question -- MR. KING: Excuse me, on the question , I believe that since the arbitrator 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 sided in favor of the Scranton Police Department , we have just seen now that the clerical has followed along through the negotiation process as well. I believe that once we start offering this to multiple unions in the city that we are opening ourselves up to potential litigation . That's what's called disparate treatment . And as a result, I think that this is probably the wise move at this time because in leaving the fire department out, they're kind of singled out and actually as well as DPW because those contracts will be coming up ultimately . But what we're basically saying is everybody else -- to everybody else who doesn't have to live in the city; but, you, the fire department and, you, DPW, you have to. And you have to wait until your contract is negotiated . I'll guarantee that an arbitrator would indicate or a lawyer and a judge would indicate this is disparate treatment against those two groups. And that's why I would be willing voting for this -- in favor of this this evening .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. SCHUSTER : So just another one on the question , back to that wording that was used, in that backup document it does state the waiver of the residency . But it does state that anyone who has a collective bargaining agreement will still be subject to negotiations . So it doesn't appear that that would be the case at this point in time. Also in looking at -- I do feel that more discussion is needed. If we're looking at those entrance tests, if we're looking at promotional exams, things like that, I do think we should look at a way to invest in employees that remain in the city, those employee s that are going to buy a home in the city, those employees that are going to remain in the city, is there a way that we could reward those who are investing in the City of Scranton . And I think that needs to be further discussion . MR. MCANDREW : In addition , if I could add, you know, financial impact, none. Are you kidding me? The potential of lost revenue -- I mean, I know a lot of the police officers didn't move out of the city, but the potential is there. So there is no plan for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 that. Did anybody think of that? No. Was that brought up? No. How about the resident who always wanted to be a police officer or a firefighter , which is admirable wants to stay in the city and apply and go through the system or any other employee that wants and loves their city, wants to live here and work here? Do they get some type of preference during the hiring process a point or two like it's done in school district s, like it's done everywhere else where when they apply they should, you know, because of their love for their city and they want to stay and work here and, you know, and account for higher taxes, they should get some type of scoring during the hiring process that would help them, you know, fulfill that dream. So I don't see any of that addressed in here, anything answered in here. And I don't get the financial impact, none. We lose taxpayers , folks. So, you know, of course, this was shoved down real quick right before we go on recess as usual. And, you know, there is multiple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 reasons why I don't like it. And right now -- and, yes, a judge is going to say it was done in arbitration and that the fire department deserves it. Sure they do. But it states here under notes -- other notes no matter what we do tonight , they have to wait. The only ones that don't have to wait will be the administrative hires. And how many openings do we have? They'll be flying in through our recess. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm going to add my on the question , so I'll be voting in favor of this. I've stated for several years now here on Council that I believe it is antiquated that we even have a residency requirement as Mr. Mancini pointed out since 1979. So that's 45 years ago. Things have certainly changed in our are city since then and many other cities do not -- most other cities do not have a residency requirement . I think it's insane that we still do have one. And so I've always been in favor of repealing that for our city so that anyone is able to work in our city. I think as Miss Hodowanitz pointed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 out just because someone doesn't live in the city does not mean that they are not going to do a great job in their position as a city employee and that they're still not going to be devoted to their position . I think that's a complete falsehood that just because you live in the city you are going to care more about your job for the city. So I welcome anyone to work here. And I also believe that many of the open position s we've had, we've had trouble filling with people who live in the city. And many of the applicants we've received have been from outside of the city is what I've heard on many of the positions that we've had open in the past. So, yes, it will make it easier to fill those positions and if we don't have people who live in the city who are chomping at the bit to get to those jobs and someone else from outside of the city is willing to take them on, then I'm fine with that. I'm also not sure where the confusion is with the other contracts with SFD. I mean, if that's going to happen either way, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 why not just complete this now and make it fair for all of the employees even the administrative ones and have everyone on the same playing field. The contracts , I think that's in there because our legislation that's not going to supersede the CBA. So they're going to have to change those anyway to include the -- remove the residency requirement . That was my understanding as to why that was included . And we could certainly ask for more clarification on that. And I'd like to hear more from the administration about it. But I'm in favor and I have -- I take no issue with removing the residency requirement . MR. SCHUSTER : So as stated before, the residency requirement will be removed across all of these bargaining units as their contracts come up. The backup here states that negotiations will occur anyway. So negotiations will be occurring anyway. If we do this tonight -- if we even forego our rules and do it tonight , it's not going to start tonight because anyone that has a CBA will still need to negotiate as per the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 backup document . I think a bigger discussion should occur as to whether we're going to reward our employee and reward our union employees that want to invest in our city. And I think that's a better -- either we have a more thorough discussion or a better place for this to occur is at negotiations when both sides have legal Council . That's my opinion here tonight . I would like to see this not introduced so more discussion can occur. MR. SMURL: Thank you, everyone . Naturally there is going to be a lot of questions about everything on this. This is only for introduction so that we could begin the process of naturally asking all of these questions . We actually have to have an executive meeting for this. So I will be in favor of introducing it so that we could start and ask all of the questions . There are a lot of things that aren't clear. But that's how everything starts here. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? MR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – REMOVING THE LICENSE AND INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMERCIAL SCALES AND GASOLINE SERVICE STATIONS . MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , two things that I have. So at this point in time according to the Clerical Union CBA that was passed last week by the union, they're going to be removing the weights and measures position . That's going to be now switching to a housing inspector . This is a revenue generating 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 position . And it stated that -- the city administration stated that the state is going to take over this duty. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask did the city administration get absolute confirmation that the state will take over this duty? And then it was stated in the backup document s that we are the only municipality in the state that completes our own weights and measures on our own. So can we find out are we, in fact, the only municipality in the state that completes the weights and measures function as stated in the backup document . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get clarification on both questions . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I'm sorry, I voiced the same concerns in caucus that, okay, so if it's the responsibility normally of the Commonwealth to do this and we've been doing it just for whatever reason for all these years and no one else does, has the state been notified that, hey, we're not doing it anymore. You guys better start doing it. So I need to know that if they are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 prepare d to do the work now for us if that conversation took place. MR. KING: On the question , on the question , the backup documentation indicates that we presently have a MOU with PDA. And it's my understanding that if under a memorandum of understanding if one side decides to no longer, you know, when the MOU is up, each side has an opportunity to, you know, decide not to participate with the MOU any longer. So I'd like to pass this this evening and get clarification from the administration , number one, when is the end date of the MOU; and number two, have we, in fact, notified PDA that we are no longer interested in maintaining this MOU that we're going to toss it back to PDA.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – REAPPOINTMENT OF JULIE SCHUMACHER COHEN AS A MEMBER OF THE SCRANTON HOUSING AUTHORITY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS FOR A FIVE (5) YEAR TERM TO EXPIRE ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2029. MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-S be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 I was getting at here tonight is there is 17 people being appointed -- or I should say reappoint ed to boards. Out of the 17, this is the only person that is not being reappoint ed. This is Mr. Terrence Gallagher . He's spent many years on this board, dedicate d a lot of years to this board. I've said it before from here in the past and I'm going to say it again. This administration has removed some of these long time members from these positions , people that have been dedicated for years. They are replaced by someone that's new and they last for maybe a few short months or year. We have two on here tonight that have already resigned after a year of service or less than a year of service , just something I wanted to point out. I'm going to be voting no for this appointment . MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so whatever happen to rewarding people that are loyal, that are devoted, that work hard, whatever happened to rewarding people with experience , bring value that want to stay? All right. It seems that the ones 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 that -- the appointment s that we get are -- the past three I remember Mr. Galella since I'm here. I remember Mr. Granahan who loved what they were doing, was on these boards for years and they were replaced. It's unfortunate . Okay, they're up in my age. They're my age or older. You know, with age comes wisdom and dedication and loyalty . I'm not saying nothing against Mrs. Cohen. If, you know, if Mr. Gallagher didn't want to remain, I'd vote for her. But another part I don't like about this is, the administration trying to replacing him a year early, a year early. You know, it's crazy we see these things coming down for reappointments in December . But the administration tried to replace him a year ago, which is absurd. So, you know, okay, so he has 40 years on the housing authority . He's there 40 years for a reason. He got reappoint ed a bunch of times because he was doing a great job. So, like I said, nothing against Mrs. Cohen, you know, but if -- we got to keep the people that want to stay and continue to do great work and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 not just replace them for whatever reason maybe because they're older because that's what it appears to me when I keep seeing this. And I hope that's not the case. So I'll be voting no. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I don't take any issue with Mr. Gallagher . And I truly appreciate the years of service s that he has given to this board. I have served on many boards over the years. And they all had term limits on how long you could serve on it. And I believe that it's healthy for boards and commissions to have turnover and to have new members over those periods of time. I believe that new members bring new and different perspective s and backgrounds . And so, you know, I think it's a positive thing to have those changes , not necessarily a quick turnover where someone 's not going to remain on for their term. But, you know, I think that it can be a positive thing. And I know Miss Cohen is -- will be very qualified and will be well-suited for this board. So I will be voting in favor of this legislation . And once 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 again, I want to thank Mr. Gallagher for all of his years of service and work on this board. MR. SMURL: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. SMURL: The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-T.

MCANDREW : Well, and also on the question , Mr. Salerno, I was a classmate with him. And, you know, so he's been on this for multiple years because he's doing great work. And he's my age, but, you know, it's okay. And he does great work. So I'm glad to see him reappointed as well as other -- you know, Mr. Gallagher should have been too. MR.

MR. SMURL: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-F. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , last week I asked about the auditing services , 580 thousand dollars was going to be reallocated from ARPA auditing to other areas. The answer that I got was that the city has adequate funding allocated to complete the requirements for those ARPA audits and, therefore , they're going to reallocate those remaining funds. So they're saying that they have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 enough money to do those audits. A portion of this is crosswalk s. And I know that Mr. McAndrew brought up in caucus about the crosswalk s. And I know he's going to touch on it now. I'll add a piece to that once he's done. And I brought up the crosswalk on Main Avenue in West Scranton near the post office. There's been some incidents on that in that area and one person did die in the area due to being struck by a car. Of this funding , Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask -- I know there were -- crosswalk s were part of the West Scranton 10 year revitalization project . Are these funds going to cover some of those crosswalks that were included in that West Side revitalization or will those be additional crosswalks ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. MR. MCANDREW : Also on the question , so I know some of this money is going to be reallocated for transportation services , meaning crosswalks . It's sad because every 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 year, every couple years resident s have to come to us and say, oh, we need the crosswalk painted. It faded. So with that said, first of all, I'd like to request the list of crosswalk s that are going to be completed this year. And also, if we could ask administration if they would develop some type of schedule so every year that they're looked at or maintain ed because the issue is maintenance of these crosswalks . And also, I know there is always some dispute between who owns the street, the state or us or whatever . So we need to take care of that because we're mandated by the state to provide crosswalks and safe school zones, you know, that have signs that say 15 miles an hour. I don't think we're doing that. And, you know, not just -- and it's not just public schools , parochial schools too. So I'd like to if you could send that or inquires over to make sure, you know, or if you want to have a dialogue about it, we can come in and we can discuss it. But I think we need to do it because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 I don't think we're doing a good job at it. And I think we need to do it before school, which, you know, quickly approaching . And then, you know, a couple of them were already brought here and requests were made for Woodlawn and North Washington . They need signage and repainting , 2115 North Washington . You know, and the signage is suppose d to contain the hours too also when this is a school zone. I think we got to get back and get up to speed with what really is a requirement by the state, okay? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm also in agreement with requesting a schedule for crosswalks . And I just agree that it's terrible how we've let a lot of the crosswalks go within the city. It really brings more visibility to those dangerous intersection s and hopefully can prevent people from getting in an accident or getting hit by a vehicle if we have -- if we're able to keep up better with the crosswalks throughout the city. So I would like to see us develop a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 schedule to do that and with the focus, of course, as Councilman McAndrew mentioned on the school areas in particular . I think those should take priority as well. MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, add to that, you know, the school areas were something we discussed definite in need of that. And one thing that he said in addition to that was, you know, St. Clare's/St. Paul's had come to us and requested some of that. And after that meeting also, All Saints Academy had reached out. So just let's not forget those parochial schools as well as the Scranton School District . MR. SMURL: Thank you. I also agree and I would hope that all schools take priority . I don't know when we're going to start this project , but hopefully we could get it started, complete it before school gets back because we're only a matter of weeks away before school starts again.
