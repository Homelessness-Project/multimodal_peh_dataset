Despite repeated efforts byCouncilman Rogan andmyself togetitbackontrackafter several cancellations westillhaven'thad oursecond meeting .Thereareaalotmore issues totackle soweneedtogetthose meetings scheduled again. Ironically ,theoneandonlytopic ofconversation atthisfirstmeeting was therental registration ordinance . Actually ,Ifeltthemeeting wentwelland thatconsensus wasreached onseveral years. One,theordinance should berevised and create asimpler ,moreuserfriendly ordinance forallinvolved ;two,thefees should bereduced ;andthree,theactual registration should beoutsourced tothe thirdpartyvendor.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Mypersonal conclusion andthe benchmarksforanylegislation thatshould comebefore citycouncil should alsoinclude thefollowing :The$150perstructure fee should beremoved .Theperunitfeeshould bereducedtosomewhere between $25and$40 instead ofthecurrent $50andespecially to belimited toeveryotheryear. Also,theannual registration should include acolored sticker thatwillbe displayed attheregistered property and mustbevisible fromtheexterior.Anew sticker willbeissued annually withthe registration .ThiswillallowforLicense andInspections Department toimmediately knowiftheproperties isregistered .If thereisnosticker oritisnotvisible the property ownerwillbefined. Andfinally ,andthisisnotopen fornegotiation asfarasI'mconcerned ,the actual registration mustbedonebyathird partyvendor.Despite theirbestefforts ,I estimate thatthecityhasregistered only 25percent ofallrental units.Theremay be10,000unitsormoreinthecityandwe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 current lyhaveapproximately 2,500 registered .Sowhatwehaveis25percent paying ahigher feetocompensate forthe75 percent thatarenotregistered . Therental registration process has beenongoing forthelast15yearssoto haveonly25percent registered afterthat longisnotfairtothelandlords whohave registered andpaid,thetaxpayers who expect anefficient government fortheirtax dollars ,andeventhosethatarecurrently trying todotheregistration without the toolstocomplete thetask.Thatisnot necessarily areflection onthis administration ,thisissomething thathas beengoingonfartoolonganditistimeto turntheprocess overtoaprofessional company withtheability andresources to getuscloseto100percent registration and compliance aspossible .Itisquitesimple, withdramatically morelandlords paying the fee,thefeecanbereduceddramatically . Another byproduct oftheincrease to theamount ofunitsregistered wouldbea largeincrease inthetrashfeecollection .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 Asmorerental unitscomeoutofthe shadows ,itisnotunreasonable toexpect thatalargenumber ofthoseunitsarenot paying thegarbage fees.Evenifwepickup anadditional 2,000trashfeesoutofthe estimated 7,500currently unregistered units,thatwillmeananadditional $600,000 tothecity,andmaybewithmorepeople paying thatfeewecanfindawayto actually reduce,Isaidreduce,thetrash collection feesforourtaxpayers orat leastfindawaytoreducethefeeforour senior citizen property owners. Iknowit'sanovelapproach and concept ,butefficient government canreduce costs,increase revenue andtherefore reduce feessocommon senseshould neverbeviewed asourenemyandwhenitispresented tous weshould embrace it.That'sallIhave.
