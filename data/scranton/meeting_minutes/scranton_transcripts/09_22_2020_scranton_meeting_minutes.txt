Are there any comment s on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I'd just like to make one comment . I see 3-J, the VFW and also the Marine Corps League in the request . One thing to just keep in mind, the Tripp Park Community Center is also a City community center. And when I last spoke with them, I feel like they may have even taken money out of their own pocket to pay for utilities maybe in last month and help with winterization . So it might be something to keep in mind and reach out to them as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Good point. Thank you. Anyone else on the Third Order items? Okay. If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have one quickly . Next Wednesday , September 30th is the last day 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 to fill out your census forms. So if you haven't, please go to 2020census.gov and fill out your census. It's extremely important to the funding that the City is going to receive in the next 10 years. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Kyle. Anyone else? Any announcements ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have two of them. So once again our friends at the Friends of the Poor tomorrow will be doing their emergency drive through food giveaway again. It will be at Scranton High, 2:30 to 5:30 and, you know, 63 Munchak Way, Scranton , PA. All of the criteria applies as in the past. I don't need to have to go through all of that. I also have another one. This is a little early out. But it require s that you get tickets first. So the Minooka Lions Club is going to have a chicken barbecue fundraiser on Sunday, October 18th. It's their first annual barbecue . You know, it's a fundraiser. It's going to be homemade barbecue chicken dinner for $12 or two dinners for 20. That's a great deal. You get a half a chicken , baked potato, baked beans, homemade coleslaw 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 and roll. It's at the YMS of R Park on Kane Street. It's pickup and takeout only. It's noon to four. Like I said, it's a little early for that. But you need to get tickets ahead of time. You could get tickets . You could check on the Facebook page or you can get them at Joyce's Cafe or Castaldi 's Market or ask a Lion's Club member. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Any other announcements ? I have one. Council received three letters of interest for the two vacancies on the City's Ethics Board. Those three individual were Matthew Myer, TJ Finley, and Mike Stanilka . Council 's going to take time over the next few days to review these letters of interest and resumes and then hopefully we'll all be prepare d next week to discuss them in the caucus and then make a decision on those two appointments . And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Will someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following citizens : Mr. Thomas Coyne, Miss Marie Schumacher and Mrs. Fay Franus? MR. SCHUSTER : I'll make a motion. MR. DONAHUE : I'll make a motion. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? I'm now going to ask our City Clerk, Lori Reed to read these comments from the public into the record. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission by Mr. Coyne: Some of the new board members , those who joined in back in January 2020 or later, missed my first few weeks in council . I was disturbed by the appointment of an IT manager for Scranton without interviews or council 's input. I have no issue, if it was reasonable and needed, and the candidate was properly vetted for the position . But just like a major corporation , the job of the head of the IT department is the City CIO 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 (Chief Information Officer ) and should be vetted as such. On August 04, 2020, Just as council oversight was off for a month, we were gifted Amanda Hallock as information technology manager at $47,900 a year. I would have no issue with this except in December of 2019, I inquired on the readiness of the city for both cyber attacks and particularly ransom ware. This caught the attention of a leaving council member and it was put forward to review based on my input of the hazards of IT and sun-setting operation systems as well as access control policies . I was asked if a backup is good enough for recovery and I explained the risks, This including Baltimore incurring a 3 month loss of network , they lost a lot of data, as not everything was backed up and stored. A backup and a recovery is good in theory, but unless the staff has attempted a roll back/ recovery , and has policies and separate storage systems , a roll back can only work so far. It cost Baltimore $18.2 million to restore systems and make up for lost or delayed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 revenue , this did not include unrecoverable data. I was told it would be looked into and I would get some feedback but since the data is sensitive , there is only so much that can be publicly discussed . This is a little disingenuous as IT people can discuss policy and practice without exposing a system. In the month we have had a new IT manager who it seems may lack proper credentials for the position . Let me explain . When there is a Riot you want a great Chief of Police (oops.. he is gone now), When there is a major fire or plague, you want a great Fire Chief... well... you get me. IT secures the city data and should be prompting options to improve stability , compliance and providing a shared reporting resource for data, including contracts , all expenditures , a listing of all contract start and end dates that warn well in advance a contract term is ending/needs attention . On August 25th, WILK newsroom reported that “Scranton officials say it was a ransomware cyber-attack that affected the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 city's non-emergency computer systems this past weekend . In a press release , they say an investigation by third-party specialists made the determination and they are trying to assess whether sensitive information was accessed . If they find that the security of residents or staff are affected they will notify the public. There will be more updates as information is available ." Why was a Third Party required ? What is the cost? What has Scranton done since December 2019 to mitigate risks, as it was warned of a full 9 months prior? One submitter to council 's 4th order asked why Scranton seems to be hiring as if it is a New York Promotional Tour? I ask looking at Amanda Hallock 's experience , I only find this.. “Passionate about state and local digital government , equitable community development , and acronyms .” And “ I am originally from Baltimore Maryland and worked in Philadelphia on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 community development , program evaluation and collective impact before coming to HKS (Harvard Kennedy School). Over my time here I have explored my passion for the impact of government administration , digital transformation , and inter-agency collaboration on the lives of marginalized individuals in the United States. “ (not a computer training school). An IT management position , one of three IT positions in the city, is not a place for “digital transformation ” and Impacting government administration and HR policies ... The Head of IT should be well versed in the job of data protection , security , mitigation , past and current technology , Zero day Exploits , As well as Windows , Apple and Linux OS. I have it stored on the Cloud is not a solution . What are; Amanda Hallock 's specific IT (information Technology ) history ? What Computer training certifications does she hold? Did she work as IT Management prior, and if so, how big was the corporation and how many IT professionals was she in direct management of? Critical Data and data requested for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 public review, or council with fuel cards, or maybe when the feds stop by... should not be on a standard system but separated and isolated for security . The IT manager is just as important as the Fire Chief or Chief of Police. The IT covers all financial data, all HR data, All Bills, All licenses , All e-mail both public and confidential . This is a position that should be vetted and not handed out like candy, and the applicant should be brought before council and the public to reply to some hard asked questions of qualifications and goals moving forward . Some may think I am over reacting , and some may remember .. I warned you about a Cyber attack risk and needs for review in December of 2019. One has now happened /started . I warned you in early February when everyone was saying the coronavirus was just overseas and not an issue and no one needed masks, and when City Council provided feedback to my questions , from the CDC guidance . I provided real information directly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 from Wuhan and from John Hopkins , including the advice to stock up on masks and Personal Protective equipment , (including a portable UVC light for sanitation in city hall, including bathrooms ).. Because there was going to be a run and masks and personal protective gear would become non available . That we were looking at the front end of a major outbreak and it would be wise to get ahead, and I did it in confidence to not cause panic and knowing I may have seemed to be a little extreme on the subject . I looked to the Trash and Recycling and was told we pay $43 and change a ton to dispose trash, somehow in the recent meeting the number jumped 33%. I looked and numbers did not add up from the trash fee collected and expenditures , but no one seems to know what it costs to run the DPW. This is from the Mayors reply to me after 6 months. If the City contract with the Recycling is not void, The County on the hook for all losses, not the City, and we still have no Idea what profit was gained and the distribution due from the recycling center from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 prior years. Council asked, has the question been addressed ? I provided about $700,000 in budgetary savings at a glance, even doing due diligence with Scranton Tomorrow , who has an operational budget of $ 100,000 a year and has in excess of ½ million now on reserves , and Scranton is handing them $ 225,000/yr so they can listen to local business and coordinate a web page, and run services for the University of Scranton . (Scranton already handed out $100k in April, When city workers were let go and not getting a paycheck .) Local business should be coordinated by the Small Business Association and the Scranton Chamber of Commerce . If they as “small business owners” need help they have resources in each other and the internet . This COVID-19 issue will be with us into next year, we most likely have a good 9-12 months left to go. All non essential spending in Scranton should be suspended . I have no issue with St Cats in Nay Aug Park and Similar charity , I support animal and people related 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 aid, but not Scranton marketing , the trees and beatification in our financial position . Last, we stand on the cliff of budget 2021, we are expecting revenue shortfalls but as far as I know, other than a furlough of a few City employees , we have not changed or reduced our financial footprint . Per my prior warning and then backed up by PEL and ignored , Both the Police and Fire Contracts end on 12/31/2020. The Golden Package the City has handed out to both Departments has to stop. Insurance and pension and other benefits now are more expensive then payroll for the staff, (increasing every year at about a 4-7% rate, not even including payroll increases ) and continue well after retirement or moving to a second job. I do not think we should retroactively remove earned benefits , but going forward the field has to change. All Corporations long ago left pensions for 401k matching and none extend lifetime free benefits to wives and children of working /retired members . We need to change the contract going forward and grandfather in those on the books 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 now, we need to offer early retirement , once the change has been made to those on the books to get them out and change the system. We may even have to bargain with the unions to set a percentage of the current retirement funds aside, and invest them, instead of the market, to invest them in a special bond issue. Asking them to invest in the city that invests in them. A police/fire bond that mandates the retirement of Scranton 's older bonds with high interest for a protected but lower percentage . Securing a set rate for stability to the retirement fund and retiring older debt at a higher rate. The Silence on fixing 2020 and cutting 2021 budget is telling . Everything is now by emergency order and pushed forward ... contracts , employees , independent hiring of external staff as un-bid contractors . We can pay $100k to Scranton tomorrow , but it's September and I have yet to see a street sweeper ? We have a School District needing more taxes, when they got an increase for last year. They are paying almost nothing on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 utilities and maintenance of Schools without students , and they still want to tax more. Do you have a plan? Submitted by Thomas Coyne. The next submission is from Marie Schumacher : O The Administration , with Council 's accord one must assume, put a halt to a Third-Party Evaluation of the LIPS Department in favor of an in-house LIPS evaluation . Has the Council received in in-house evaluation and what changes will be made? O What is the status of the Courts Approval of replacing the Business and Licensing Tax with the Payroll Preparation tax? Do you expect the change to be effective in te 2021 budget? O Once a Contract has been executed both parties must comply unless they officially execute an amendment . A bit of digging to determine why cars are parking too close to the end of the street endangering vision-blocked drivers . The unoffical reason is the promised 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 revenue the Police were to bring to the coffers by moving tw clerical workers onto the street to enforce illegal parking . So, I ask you whether this is true. If it is and has been done without a revised Contract I believe the City is liable for not making the Police comply with the Contract . O A few days back I drove down James Street toward the Mill Apartment and then went right across the railroad tracks where there were two street between James and the East Scranton fields, neither had City (green and white) street signs but one had what appeared to be a home made street signs (wood ). Why do these streets have no City street signs. O We are close to the Fourth Quarter of the year, does the City plan make a decision on Storm Water; that is, Authority or in-house? This year. O Last week you said there is a Gas card policy. Would you please tell me the url to read this Policy? O When will the promise utility bill audit be available ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 O When will the 2019 City Audit be received ? The third and final submission is from Fay Franus: Council , Last week councilman Gaughan stated that ECTV does NOT receive money from the Comcast Franchise Fee. I am fully aware ECTV received money from Comcast but I am specifically ONLY speaking of the money from the Comcast Franchise Fee. I have asked this question previously but it seems I must ask yet again. 1. WHY IS ECTV NOT RECEIVING ANY MONEY FROM THE COMCAST FRANCHISE FEE? I have done some research and I have found the following from the FCC: "Franchise fees are governed under Section 622 of the Cable Communications Act of 1984.[2] Section 622, states that municipalities are entitled to a maximum of 5% of gross revenues derived from the operation of the cable system for the provision of cable services such as Public, educational , and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 government access (PEG) TV channels ." Mr. Gaughan you once said you would look into why ECTV was not receiving any money from the Comcast Franchise Fee. 2. Have you ever done that? This Cable Communications Act seems definitely to imply ECTV should indeed be getting money that the city receives from the Comcast Franchise fee--up to 5%. 3. Is the city going to include money in their new budget for ECTV from the Comcast Franchise Fee? If so how much? 4. What exactly does the city do with the money they receive each year from the Comcast Franchise Fee? 5. Does this money go into a discretionary fund? Yes or no. 6. Do you actually know how this money is being spent? If not why not? My comments regarding my questions . Please do not tell me you sent me the contract . I say this because I am not a lawyer. I don't understand contracts . Also the people in the city need to know the answers to my questions not just me. Anyone who pays a Comcast Cable 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 bill pays a franchise fee in their bill so this is our money I am asking about. I feel strongly that ECTV should be receiving money in the city's upcoming budget up to 5% of the fees to pay for their operating budget and their salaries . I do not believe they have received anything from the Comcast Franchise fee in years and years maybe over 10. Which is wrong. ECTV provides wonderful services and educational programs to our community . Our county and city government meetings also are shown on ECTV and updates from our Mayor on many important happenings in the city. I also dropped off documents to show you that many cities across the country like Portland Oregon pay their PEG channels millions every year to proved services to their communities just as ECTV does for us. Please find the time too go over this document to get more familiar with how PEG channels need money from their cable franchise fees to cover their expenses . I would like as many answers to these questions tonight . Please do not give me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 the run around-like last week when Bill Gaughan said ECTV does NOT get money from the Comcast Franchise fee but never bothered to mention why they did not. What I took from that was--the city does not want us to know why they have not received money from the Comcast Franchise Fee in years. It's time for answers that get deep into what is going to transpire as far as ECTV getting money from this Comcast Franchise fee. As submitted by Fay Franus. (This concludes letters as submitted to Council for public comment .) MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. I'll start with the -- on the question , I'll start with the ECTV comments . And I mentioned this in the caucus. So two things, number one, ECTV does not receive any money as I mention ed last week from Comcast franchise fee or the agreement . The money that they received came in install ments over the last few years from a grant that was within the franchise fee agreement . This was voted on back in I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 2015. I talked to Mark Migliore today from ECTV. That grant has been exhausted . I think the payment s came in installments 56,000 and some-odd dollars . Moving forward , I can't answer why in past the City administrations did not grant ECTV funding other than the grant money. Moving forward , however , I have spoken months ago to ECTV official s including Mark Migliore as late as today. And what we're going to do is sit down with them and the administration and make sure that there is funding in the budget for ECTV operation s. And the way that we're going to do that is look at cutting out a chunk of the money that the City receives from the franchise fee agreement from Comcast . So right now we receive roughly a million dollars a year based on the number of subscribers . So we'll look at, you know, how much they need to operate ECTV because as I mention ed in the caucus I think ECTV is important . The programming is important and especially being able to broadcast these meeting s and other government meetings out to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the public so that they can see, in fact, what's going on. So hopefully that answers the questions on ECTV. On Mr. Coyne's comment s, I'll just provide a few notes here. In the one paragraph Council oversight was off a month. I think everyone would agree with me that Council although we did not meet in the month of August, we were not off. You can ask Mrs. Reed, constant communication going on between the members and between the administration . And it didn't feel like the oversight was off for a month there at all. The questions about the IT manager , the IT manager is a position that was already in the 2020 budget. I believe what the Mayor did was fill -- or put someone else in that position . The director -- there is still a director of information technology . That's Frank Swietnicki . That is the only control Council has in terms of advice and consent. So Council does not have any control over who the Mayor hires for an IT manager position because that position is not in the cabinet. It's not a cabinet position . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 In terms of the other IT questions , again, we're going to submit those to the Mayor and to the IT department so that they could answer those for Mr. Coyne. Some of the other questions from last week that Mr. Coyne had raised, "What has City Council identified in the 2020 budget that can be removed ?" The 2020 budget is set. There's nothing that, you know, Council can remove. We can't just say we're going to take that out. We're going to take this out. That would have to be done really by the administration . So otherwise , you know, if they don't spend money or they don't fill a position or they don't do a program or enact a program that would be their prerogative . Is there a plan to put a hold on future funding for Scranton Tomorrow at least until budget and disruption s are resolved ? I'm sure that will be part of the discussions as we go through the 2021 budget. I also want to make a note to Mr. Coyne and Miss Shumacher or Miss Franus who made comments about Scranton Tomorrow , it's my understanding that most of if not all of the funding for Scranton Tomorrow at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 least I think in this year's budget was provide d by a pilot payment from the University of Scranton . So I think the University gives us 200 and some thousand dollars . It's my understanding that we use that money to go towards Scranton Tomorrow . So there would not have really been an effect on our budget. In terms of contract negotiations what has been done, Council doesn't negotiate contracts . We have not done so in the past. We'll vote on the Collective Bargaining Agreement when it comes to us when it's on our agenda. But I know the administration is not going to discuss those conversations now because they're private (audio interruption .) But we certainly can forward that to the administration . Again, benefits , pensions , how they're going to be handled going forward , those are all questions for the administration . And I'm sure those are all up for discussion in the contract negotiations . And the one question here, Has the Mayor's office and City Council been reviewing the former 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 bargaining agreement and, if so, when did the evaluation of the pending -- of collective bargaining agreement start? I'm not sure I understand that question . Again, that would be a function of the administration . Council has their chance to review the Collective Bargaining Agreement when it's on our agenda in front of us and we're going to vote to approve that. So I'm sure those -- again, those are conversations for the administration . On the -- on Miss Shumacher 's questions rather, the third party evaluation of the LIPS Department , has Council received an inhouse evaluation and what changes will be made? No, we have not. The administration is going to be in for a September 29th caucus to discuss that subject . The status of the Court's approval of replacing the business and licensing tax with the payroll preparation tax. I believe , Kyle, is that -- did we get a hearing for that? MR. DONAHUE : No, we're still waiting for a hearing date before the Court on that. And I was going to address that too. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 And, I mean, I do expect the change to be affected in the 2020 budget, from my perspective I do. You know, so we're working towards that. We're sort of getting into the data on what we had from last year and then transferring it over into what we got from Berkheimer this year. So it is a work in progress . But there will be a proposed rate by the time that the court hearing happens . There will be a proposed rate at least on the City side. The school district doesn't need their rate to be approved by the Court but the City does. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. In terms of the other questions here with the -- I'm not sure I fully understand this question about the police department and the parking enforcement division . We'll check with the police department . I'm not sure what -- exactly what the question is there. The question is without a revised contract -- I'm not -- so we'll get in touch with Miss Shumacher to see if she could clarify that. We'll forward the other items onto the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 appropriate department . As for the question that Miss Shumacher proposed on stormwater , "We're close to the fourth quarter of the year. Does the City plan to make a decision on stormwater whether it's the authority or inhouse?" I brought this up the last few weeks. We actually requested a meeting with the company that was to come in and analyze whether it would be the right move to create a city authority or to do an inhouse or to create a regional -- on a regional basis. So we're still waiting for an answer on that. MR. DONAHUE : And, Bill, just add -- just, I mean, just to add to that too, I mean, considering we are in September , I mean, I really wouldn't be expecting a decision to be made on that by the end of the year. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Mrs. Reed, if you could send or have the administration send Miss Shumacher the gas card policy. I know I've seen that before. I think it might have been on the agenda in Third Order at one point in the last few months. But if you wouldn't mind sending that to her. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 The utility bill audit, I've asked for quite some time about this. Mrs. Reed, if we could ask again for an update on the utility bill audit? This was a company that was hired and we approved the contract I think last year or the year before for a company to come in and look at the telephone bills, electric , sewer, water, everything and, you know, see if we could find any savings. So it looked hopeful at that time. But we still have not received an update. And then in terms of the -- "When will the 2019 City audit be received ?" We can double-check on this. I think we just received an update in the last two weeks. From my memory, Councilman Schuster , read it into the record. But we'll double-check on that and have an answer hopefully next week. And I think that's it. Again, the other question s that were posed on the IT Department , we've forwarded everything from last week that we couldn't answer because we did not know the specific answers for the IT Department . We forwarded that onto the administration . And we'll wait 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 to see what they come back with. Okay. Anyone else on the question on citizen 's comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : President Gaughan , it's my understanding that the two civilian parking enforcement officers were in the clerical union. And they were furloughed and haven't been called back yet. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. SCHUSTER : I don't know that for sure. But that was my understanding . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Yep. I think you're right on that. Very good. Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : Just to answer a question we got last week regarding the numbered recyclable in terms of the plastic recyclable s that are accepted by the Recycling Center, the numbers that appear on the bottom of the plastic that are accepted are one, two and four. I think I said last week that I thought it was one, two, three. I knew there was three of them. But three is excluded . And it is one, two, and four. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. Motion has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 been made. It's been seconded . We discuss it on the question . All those in favor of the motion to accept public comment signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : I do not. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments at this time? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do. I have a couple. So, Mrs. Reed, I received an e-mail I think you got a copy of it regarding a property on 1524-26 Capouse Avenue. I just want to go on record with this one. That property is in deplorable 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 condition . If you zoom in on the photo attached , you will see a great deal of damage and that most windows are covered in newspaper and/or cardboard. Each morning at 10 a.m., a van arrives and about a dozen people are picked up. The group is dropped off around 10 p.m. each night. This afternoon I witnessed two men handling several metal frame beds. There was another bed there but it was hard to determine if they were taking the beds into the home or removing them. I'm deeply concerned about the condition of the house as it's most certain ly a fire hazard. It would seem to me that there are far more people living there that can be considered safe. I worry about the being -- the well-being of these individuals . I realize it may not be in the jurisdiction of the LIPS Department but I think it bears mentioning . So this was e-mailed to me and Mr. Oleski. Lori, I'd just like you to follow up with this. I'll send you a copy of this if you want. It will be easier for you because there's a photo -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MS. REED: Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : I don't know if you heard me. So I'll forward this to you just so we get a little followup. MS. REED: I did. Thank you, Mark. MR. MCANDREW : Also this morning , I don't know if you -- I sent you another one, a blight concern across the street from 930 West Market with a couple of photos. Did you get that e-mail? I'm not sure if you got that. MS. REED: Yes, I did. I received it and I forwarded it onto the LIPS Department . MR. MCANDREW : All right. Thanks. I just wanted to make sure you got those. Also, as Chairman of the Committee on Public Safety, I would like to recognize Operation Grabbing Straws. I just saw this today that in the month of July, 2020, the Scranton Police Department , the Street Crimes Unit and collaboration with the State Police and the District Attorney 's Office had something called Operation Grabbing Straws where 26 individuals adults and juveniles were arrested , 39 criminal complaints , total of 91 felonies , 79 misdemeanors , 25 total firearm s were seized, 22 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 search warrant s were completed and executed , five court orders were completed . The streets of the City of Scranton are safer without these firearms in the hands of criminals . What they also say is the community support -- the community support and desire to keep city neighborhood s peaceful is what motivates the Police Department 's members to work around the clock. I'd just like to congratulate them on their efforts with that. And that is all I have now. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I do not. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And, Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comment s at this time? Oh, you were muted. MR. DONAHUE : Sorry, yep. First off, I've been having some issues with my City e-mail. I haven't -- it says my inbox is full but I can't sign into it. So if anyone has sent an e-mail and I haven't gotten back to you I apologize for that. I'm hoping to get that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 taken care of before next week at the latest. We've been back and forth with the IT Department . And they have a lot going on right now. So I'm trying to get that done as soon as possible . In terms of one of Miss Shumacher 's comment too, I am looking forward to hearing a plan on the internal assessment of Licensing and Inspections next week from the administration in our caucus. And just to add onto what Mark said about the Street Crimes Unit, the City Street Crimes Unit is probably one of the most professional units in the state. They do a great job every day. And a lot of that goes unnoticed . So thank you, Mark, for bringing that up. Also, Miss Reed, would we be able to ask the administration for an update on when we should get the Parks and Rec facility assessment from McLane and Associates ? And besides that, that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I just have a few comments . First, I attended a North Scranton neighborhood meeting last night -- last evening . And there was two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 comment s that were brought up that I would like to address . Number one, the intersection of West Market Street and Rockwell Avenue, the neighbors were saying that crosswalk lines were faded. And that's a dangerous intersection . If they could be painted again that would be great. So if we can send that to DPW. And a gentleman stopped me and asked about the status of 1515-1517 Brick Avenue that was condemned . And they have been told it was on demolition list but haven't seen action in quite some time. So if we can check on that. Also, we are waiting for an update to see what was happening with several properties in South Side that I mentioned last week. And then there is one property at 528 Birch Street that the neighbor s have been really complain ing about that's badly overgrown. So if we can double-check on that one. I mentioned this in the caucus, but we decided to leave the capital budget on the table tonight and not take a final vote on it because we're still waiting for further 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 information from the administration . And we wanted to make sure that all of those members of the public who submitted their questions regarding the next few years of capital spending that those question s and concerns were answered and alleviated prior to a final vote. I do want to thank the Director of OECD. I had several questions on three of the agenda items that dealt with the Office of Economic and Community Development . We did receive a response that will be in Third Order for public view next week. We received it earlier this week. So I appreciate that. I did have some questions last week about the internship program , Novembrino -- the splash park project ; and we still haven't heard back on the 900 block of Prescott Avenue and some of the issues. So we still are waiting on that. Also, I mentioned in the caucus we received three letters of interest from members of the public for the two positions -- vacant positions on the Ethics Board. So we're going to take a look at those this week and then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 discuss them in caucus and choose two new members of the Ethics Board. Also, I mentioned this in caucus, September 29th, we'll be having the Mayor and Business Administrator in to give us an update on the 2020 budget impact from the coronavirus and what that looks like and how it changed for better or worse since our last update in June of 2020. And we'll also receive an update on the Licensing and Inspections review and the blight issues that we talked about in the past. And that's all I have tonight . Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.

MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Yes, on the question this is really because of a technical glitch in terms of the grant program that we previously had voted on. So one of the applicant s was left off of the original list. So now they're including that and they're using money from another pot to pay this grant off, so just a technical issue.

MCANDREW : I'd just like to say something on the question . This project was present ed to us when I was on the School Board probably four years ago. I'm glad to see that, you know, it's making progress and there's some more motion happening . So I'm happy to vote for this. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'd just like to echo Mr. McAndrew 's remarks there. I also had this presented to us while on the School Board. And it should be a beautiful project when complet ed. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : I just want to add 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 that this is specific to, like, the sidewalks and some of the surrounding areas. And so I think that this will bring a lot to the neighbor hood itself in addition to the future residents of Lace Village . So I'm happy to vote on this tonight and for it to be introduced. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I would agree with everyone who spoke so far. This project is extremely important to the City as a whole and also to that area of Green Ridge. The way that it ties in is going to tie in even with the Lackawanna Heritage Valley trails. It's going to be really important again at connecting that area to even other parts of Green Ridge and to our downtown through the trail. The thing that, you know, I really think is most important is -- and I know that the people who are involved in this project do as well, to make sure that the concerns and the voices of the neighbors in the immediate area were heard. And this really gives those neighbors a safe place to walk other than what's currently there now, which is not really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 conducive to pedestrian safety. So I agree with what everyone else said. When this project is fully completed , it's going to be beautiful . And it's really going to be a huge benefit to the City, especially in light of the great history that laceworks represents for the City of Scranton . Anyone else?

Another one is -- it just makes it even better. They give me more efficiency in warrant s, identify stolen vehicles and help 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 detectives solve major crimes. In addition , license plate detections of vehicle s known to be associat ed with threatening individuals keeps officer s safe by providing awareness to these surround ings. These technology have helped people apprehend murderers , killers , serial killers , drug traffic kers and child abductors . And my understanding of some concerns are that information can get out. But what I researched and found out is that this information is just the license plate. And if you want -- you have to get permission to use this information where it's protected from the Department of Motor Vehicle database . You need access to that. So it's not like they can just throw all this information out there like some people are question ing. So I just want to -- you know, I just want to get that out there.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 63, 2020 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON , UPON THE OFFER OF CONDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT TO THE SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT TO ALLOW PARTICIPATION IN THE ACT 120 PROGRAM , APPLICANTS WHO ACCEPT SAID OFFER WILL REIMBURSE THE CITY OF SCRANTON ON A PRO-RATA BASIS IF THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 EMPLOYEE TERMINATES EMPLOYMENT WITH THE CITY OF SCRANTON PRIOR TO THREE YEARS. MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? MR. MCANDREW : As Chairman for the Committee On Public Safety, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , so I just want to bring up quickly it's my understanding that under this resolution that perspective police officer s will not become an employee of the City of Scranton or receive any of the benefits awarded to the employees of the City of Scranton until they receive their Act 120 certification . If upon implementation of the program any of these individuals begin to be treated as employees prior to completing their Act 120 certification , I think Council should revisit this resolution . But as long as they're not City employees until they receive 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 the certification , I don't see any issue with it. And I will be supporting this resolution . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I was also glad to hear tonight or at least clarified to us that they're not employees first because that was our understanding for a couple weeks now. So -- and also, of course, I still like the fact that, you know, if they leave within three years, there's consequences . And they have to pay us back based on, you know, that. Also, and guess what? So, you know, once again, you know, they're hired first. But we will -- I'm sure we do have applicant s that already have that certification . So how fair would it be to them if they're hired with that certification because they have that versus the ones that are earning towards it. So I'm happy with some of these little changes that keep happening before final passage . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. Roll call, please, Miss Carrera . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes.

GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I do. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, I'm sorry. MR. MCANDREW : I feel the same way. So this is a step in the right direction of keeping this asset. I know there was talk about this for the past couple years up in the air, you know, whether they sell this or not. I know it's still not off the table but I'm glad to see that the investment 's being made. So in my eyes it's a step in the right direction in keeping one of our few assets that we have left. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, sorry, I'm coming back in here again. But to Mr. McAndrew 's point about one of the City's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 assets, this is an asset of the City that's been paid for by our parents, our grandparents , our great grandparents and just to get that out there.

GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I had several questions about this legislation last week. We did not receive answers to it yet. I don't want to table this because I would be concerned we would be cutting it too close to the deadline for submission which is next Wednesday . So I'm going to vote for this because ultimately , you know, we need the grant money. The biggest question I had was what's the plan for after demolishing the public facilities throughout the City. And the second question was, some of these properties particularly the one on Birney Avenue that is listed here, it's in really rough shape. The timeline that's included in this, it has to be off because the dates I think are wrong. And my concern is that, you know, getting the grant money would be great. But we have $145,000 earmarked in this budget for demolition . So for some of these properties 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 that really are a major safety hazard, we should tap into that money and get those properties down as quickly as possible . So, Mrs. Reed, if you could just, you know, politely ask the administration to get these answers to us by next Tuesday I would really appreciate that. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please.

SCHUSTER : On the question , last week I had asked about if there had been any other structure s in this zone there. I wasn't sure if there was any garages . I know those three properties were ones that were being looked at for a possible expansion there. But we didn't get any answers to that question , did we? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 MR. GAUGHAN : I don't believe so. Mrs. Reed, did we receive anything on 7-F? MS. REED: No, we did not. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. I guess I go in the same vain that you were going there, President Gaughan , to receive this information prior to next Tuesday . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Sure. Definitely . I also had had some questions . I support this. This is a long time coming. The people down in this area since I've been on Council and well before I was on Council have suffered greatly when we get, you know, major rain storms. And their properties have been -- property values have been diminished over the years. Their homes have been, you know, damaged because of the water runoff. And I think this is, again, a long time coming. And it will help not only these property owners but everyone else in that general vicinity . So I support this. Anyone else on the question ?

I failed to mention this at the beginning of the meeting and I apologize . The sobering reminder of how much of an impact this pandemic has had on the United States was evident today when it was announced that over 200,000 Americans have lost their lives to the coronavirus . And I think everyone in our City and in our county should think about that even if it hasn't affected you personally yet, think about it before you go out into a grocery store or anywhere else without a mask on. It boggles my mind -- it just -- I'm shocked every time I drive by someplace or see people congregating without masks on. It's clear from the science that masks can save lives and can blunt this pandemic . So whatever you do before you congregate or have a party or go do something , think about those 200,000 people that have passed away. Some of those lives I believe could have been saved if this country had acted and -- this federal government had acted sooner. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 So everyone in our City and in our county should continue to wear masks, practice social distancing when possible and continue to follow the rules, not because anyone's civil liberties are being taken away but because it is the patriotic thing to do. So hopefully within the next few months this, you know, this pandemic will wane. But we're still right smack dab in the middle of it. And I hope we don't forget that as a City and as a community . And that's all I have. If there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. DONAHUE : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : This meeting 's adjourned . Thank you everyone . Have a good night. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
