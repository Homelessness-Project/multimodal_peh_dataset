The garbage pickup naturally is one day behind because of the holiday on Monday. And Weston Park pool is open daily now from noon until 6 p.m. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Anyone else? MR.

So North Scranton Neighborhood Association and the North Scranton Rotary Club invite you to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 Sunday Funday, June 25th from 12 to 2 at Weston Park.

It's the first state championship of any -- in any sport male or female. I thought that was great. And it's always nice to see teams from our area excel at the state and national level. So that was great. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Looking at the City's website this week, obviously there's no firefighter 's union contract . We got 115 days more to go, I guess. I believe you told me last week that the delinquent property tax database was on the website . I failed to find it. Did you see it or were you simply told it's up? MR. KING: I believe I was told that it was up. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I didn't see it, and I clicked on every possible icon. And as I recall many moons ago, there was an excel spreadsheet in Third Order which showed various City Council taxed actions . This one was dated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 April, 2022 marked active. So it's been a while. And the delinquent refuse tax database hasn't been updated since the end of February . It's nice to have these databases to see, you know, who are the communists in our society , you know. We want to know who hasn't paid their fair share of the load. Any update on police union arbitration ? MR. KING: No update. They are just continuing with the arbitration . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I saw an interesting article in the paper on Saturday . Wild fire smoke threatens region's air again. Pollution may reach unhealthy levels in Lackawanna and Luzerne counties . And then I pulled up an old article from two years ago. City eyes keeping fixed health post, foundation to fund coordinator spot for the first three years. This is when Dr. Rachna Saxena was appoint ed our Public Health Coordinator for a 3-year period beginning in 2021. And her salary was funded by the Moses Taylor Foundation for a three-year period. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 And I recall when we had the code red on the air quality , I saw in the paper that refuse pickup was delayed by one day. But the question I had asked and not gotten an answer to was what are we doing about the homeless population who are outdoors 27 -- 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? When we have a code blue in the winter, we get them inside. So if this is ever going to happen to us again, I would hope that we are developing a plan that we could protect those people if we can. I haven't heard squat from this public health coordinator . I mean, she may be advising the Mayor privately . But it would be nice to know if we want to make this a permanent position , what's her value added. And we have an obligation to our homeless population to think about things like another code red. It bothers me that nothing happened . MR. KING: I'll speak in Fifth Order on that. We did get an update from her. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I like the 5-H about the fireworks code amendment . My only comment is, I don't think two police 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 officer s are going to be enough to make a dent and the issues we have during the summer with the fireworks . And I know from my mother's neighbors that when they are doing fireworks they are also drinking and in some occasions doing drugs, so two officers may not be enough. Controller 's report, you'd be pleased to know that Ufberg got two checks in May, one for $41,783.11 and another for $7,437.50. I think the first one involved the labor union contracts . And Kohanski got two checks, our auditor , $7,500 and $2,965. And let's hope that's the last check we have to write to those people. And I need an explanation in Fifth Order of 5-L, this nontaxable debt issuance of up to 5 million dollars . I didn't understand the legales . I didn't understand the legislative page which said it has no financial impact on the city. Why are we issuing debt or taking out debt to reimburse the city for the capital projects ? I mean, where did we go wrong? Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Faye Franus. MS. FRANUS: Faye Franus, Scranton I'm going to start by saying this. When you don't have accountability and transparency , you are undermining the faith of accountability for all the residents . They're losing their faith in the administration and Council . Every day without accountability is a problem . Last week what I saw was deplorable when it came time to vote for the legislation . Jessica Rothchild said there is some issues and then you got the three votes. Here you go. See this? This is 3-2 vote all the time. The three loyalest , Smurl, King, Rothchild doing the Mayor's bidding again delaying this legislation . Why? Because the Mayor does not want it to pass. She doesn't want any regulation s on overtime . Do you know that by the end of June there will be $300,000 in overtime since January with no records and no dates? But you said -- each one of you said, Smurl, King, and Rothchild said you wanted accountability and transparency . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 But you are hypocrites because if you wanted it, you wouldn't vote to table it. If you a have a problem with the legislation , I'm sure Attorney Gallagher could straighten that out with the police and fire and make amendments . Now, this is just ridiculous . This has to stop with these 3-2 votes all the time. And, Mr. Schuster and Mr. McAndrew , I hope every week, every week that you ask to put this back on the table. Now it's unconscionable that the Mayor voted for transparency and account ability and yet she's doing everything she can not to be account able and transparent , why? Because the voting block of unions is the biggest voting block in the city. She needs the union votes. But yet she'll make the people pay over $300,000 for six months in overtime and it's going to continue . And you know what else, Mr. Smurl, Mr. King, and Miss Rothchild , you're complicit . You're as bad at the getaway car in a robbery . You're complicit in alleged fraud, alleged deceit, and alleged theft of services 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 by allowing these people, these union people to take our money, taxpayer 's money and with no accountability whatsoever . Miss Rothchild , you said once nobody tells you how to vote, well, why don't you prove me wrong? Why don't you vote for the people for a change instead of keep on standing by the Mayor. She may be an ally for you for gay rights, but that's no reason to vote for her. She's using the three of you and you don't even care. So something has to be done. And, Mr. King, let me say this. Please spare us your self-righteous diatribe in motions to defend your honor. You have no honor. You don't deserve to sit here. Mr. Smurl doesn't deserve to sit here, neither does Jessica Rothchild . Marc Pane is running for Council come November . I hope everybody votes for Marc Pane. I'm a Democrat , but I'll vote for him. He's a Republican . It doesn't matter the party. We're talking about getting rid of people that are not accountable that are not working for the people. You three, Smurl, King, and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Rothchild , especially you, Rothchild and Smurl, because you're running for election. You should never be elected again because you are not helping the people. Now, I'm sick of your excuses . You keep on making excuses all the time, oh, we have an issue with this. We have an issue with that. I asked you point-blank do you agree with having accountability and dates and reasons for -- I never heard of any private business if they had somebody working overtime and they didn't write the reason and date, they'd be fired, but not you. You want to keep them because you want their votes. What are you afraid of? The Director is not doing his job down there, Scott Pietreface and Chris Smith the supervisor . Neither one of them are doing their job. They should be removed . Larry West didn't help either. Since last summer this overtime has been out of control and there is nobody stopping it. And you're suppose d to be there helping the people, but you're not. So what are we going to do about it? One thing else, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Mr. King, you are said you're only one vote. You know what, maybe you're not brushing up on the laws too much at City Council . But guess what you have? You have veto power. You could override the Mayor's veto. And you could vote for this legislation to have accountability and transparency , the same thing that she ran on. The Mayor ran on transparency -- she's a hypocrite as are you. So let's prove it. Please, Mr. King, I don't want hear you go on and on about you're not this and you're not that. You are complicit . You are as guilty as she is. And you are allowing theft of services . These people should go to jail for what they're doing. So remember this, don't vote for Rothchild and Smurl come November . Vote for Marc Pane or anybody else that's running , but not them because they're not for you. They are for the Mayor. They are doing her bidding . They will never stop doing her bidding. Puppets. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Franus. Bob Bolus. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. BOLUS: Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . It was a tragedy this past week to see one of our police officers die as he did. But everybody is ignoring what was going on and that his life possibly could have been saved if people were paying attention . It's the same way with kids getting into pools and things of that nature. Some people just don't realize the danger when people are around pools, partying or otherwise . And the sad part was one of our troopers is ambushed and shot and killed in the line of duty. And ask us a question , what's this world coming to? Legal marijuana , go and smoke, go out and drink, go out kill people, do whatever you want to do. Where do we draw the line on America ? You know, take a look at the flag there. It's called the American flag. In the front of this building there should only be one flag flying and that's the American flag. That's the flag to honor, nothing else should be honored . Look at Memorial Day. Did you look at all the white crosses , the veteran 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 ceremonies all over? They get one day. Our vets -- we vets get one day. And that's all we get to honor that flag from the Civil War from World War I, World War II, Vietnam , Korea. They gave us the right to stand here tonight and bitch about whatever we want to bitch about as free people. Is that flag there? Not any other flag that is flying out there. That's the flag to fly. That's the flag to honor. That's the one that says the law is the law. And it's for everyone not just separate people. And you turn around and you see all of this. I donated with President Trump a tractor trailer load of disinfectant wipes to Palestine , Ohio. And you saw what they went through down there because people didn't give a darn what was going on with the contamination and everything else. And from an environmental owner of a company , I was out there and I couldn't believe what I was watching , the contamination being spread by idiots out there with trucks and everything that were dragging it all over their city. I have trailer loads of wipes. I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 been here before. We're donating them out all over the county. We don't want anything for them. We're out here to help those that need the help that could use them. We have a couple trailer loads being delivered right here in this city in the next couple of days. And they are being donated out by myself and President Trump. This is a joint venture we took on. He's not looking for heroism or anything else. It's showing compassion in this country which we've lost. We're throwing our vets out of hotels and putting illegal immigrants in. Is that fair? Is that the right thing to do? And we're ignoring it. You know, I asked how many times change the Biden sign at least on Interstate 81. I was in Florida where I have operation s in Florida . I just come back from there. And I listen to people who travel through here want to know why we are honoring Biden after we're seeing everything that's going on the with Biden family and the administration , illegals walking through the border. Yet we drive down and we'll get a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 parking ticket, lose our license , lose our rights. These scumbags come in here and don't lose anything . And they're taking from us. Thank you, Joe Biden. And we want to honor him here in the City of Scranton ? I'll honor any president that does anything for America , not take away from us. Look what it cost to us operate our operations today. Thank you, Joe Biden. So I could go on and on down the list. Take the sign on Interstate 81 and just put Scranton next exit. You want to call it the Expressway for Biden. You want to be dumb enough to call Biden Street, Biden and do this against us? I'm a Republican . But I'm an American first. No matter what part of the world I've been in, don't ask me if I'm Republican or a Democrat . I'm an American . When I come through the borders , I go through customs . They say who you are? I'm an American . We're not doing that anymore. We're not being Americans . We're not taking care of our people. But if anybody wants any wipes they could call me at Bolus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Truck Parts. We'll be glad to donate them. They could come get them. If they want a trailer load, we'll see that they get a trailer load. And the last thing I have is with Bill Gaughan , that federal suit is proceeding because it happened right here at City Council that he violated the rules of Council . He's going to understand one thing. He called me a lot of names. But one thing he did was pick on the wrong guy because I stand up for my rights. I stand up for that flag. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident . First off, my thought s and prayers go out to the Hallock family. That was a terrible tragedy . I wish the family all the best. Fireworks , I talked about it last year and my dog was terrorized . And I heard on the news the other night and I couldn't believe my ears. I don't know if it's a city ordinance or a state ordinance that on July 2nd, 3rd, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 4th, people are allowed to shoot off fireworks until 1 in the morning . That is ridiculous . People have children and want to go to sleep. People have to go to work the next day or get up early in the morning . And they could shoot off fireworks until one in the morning ? Something is wrong there. That's ridiculous . And second of all, I called the police last year because my dog was terrorized because I know people are breaking the law and nothing is done. And I forget the exact distance but it's -- it has to be 100 or 150 feet away from another residence . And I know Tripp Park anyway. I don't think there is anywhere where residences are 150 feet apart from each other. And they're going off -- especially in the new development . I could see them from my house. And I hear them. It's ridiculous . And I called the police last year. And they had said we'll send somebody up. Nobody ever got there because they just kept shooting them off and shooting them off. Until somebody gets hurt, maybe that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 when they'll try to do something . And I said last year what we have to do, put every policeman on 4th of July weekend and just cover the city and get people the biggest fine you could. It probably won't happen. I wanted to have my say. Next thing, Mr. King, you said a while back that we're on the paving list where I live. Is it -- do you know if it's Bulwer Street or North Rebecca ? MR. KING: I don't know. I think that is posted. It's on the website , isn't it? MR. VOLDENBERG : It should be, Mr. King. MR. KING: And do we know -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll verify it for Mr. Spindler . MR. KING: Okay, if you could. MR. SPINDLER : Because Bulwer was done no more than five years ago. And North Rebecca wasn't done since the Connors ' administration . There's cracks in the pavement there. There's grass growing in the cracks. So it's Rebecca that should be paved, not Bulwer. So I hope that's --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. KING: We'll check on it for you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe it's North Rebecca where the drainage issue is. So that would be North Rebecca . But I'll confirm it, Les. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Thank you. Last time I was here I talked about the people coming out of the Family Dollar parking lot in West Side the wrong way. Sunday I took my wife there and I sat in the car. She was in the store less than 10 minutes . Five cars went out the wrong way in the less than 10 minutes she was in there. Nothing is ever done. She talked to the manager in there. He said there's nothing we can do. And a lot of them come in -- there's an entrance you come in through the alley. And on the back of the building there's a big sign still from when it was Brunetti 's. It's painted on the building . It says exit and there's an arrow pointing out the back way. If they would put that on the front part of the building , maybe people wouldn't go out the wrong way. One of these days something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 terrible is going to happen. I know last time I talked about that you said you were going to send letters to somebody or whatever . Has anybody heard anything ? MR. KING: I believe we did. Did we, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That was reviewed by the traffic officer . I'll follow up with him -- MR. KING: If you could. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : -- make sure something 's done. MR. SPINDLER : Yeah, they are not suppose d to go out to Main Avenue. All right. That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, Council , I agree with brother Bob's statements about our flag out front and everywhere . This isn't America anymore. America has become Biden's experiment on socialism . Well, to change my usual approach up here, today when I was walking my little puppy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Chumley in the area next to Redner's, it's all big grassy area if anybody 's ever been there, quite a few homeless living back there too. That's not -- I heard a voice from above -- not that one. I looked all around and there was a man standing on the bridge above me yelling at me. He wanted to know if I wanted some water for the dog and he held up a bottle. And I told him I had water in the car. But this gesture of kindness and consideration is why I just love this town and these people here and why I stayed here all of these years, over 50 years I've been here. Every once in a while you'll see something , a letter in editor thanking someone for an act of kindness . This is such a good town. Our Mayor has never been a part of this group. She's never been a part of Scranton . You know, her Scranton is the develop ers downtown . And that's not the Scranton -- they are not the ones paying for everything . They are not people that all of us talk to in different stores and businesses . There's not a person in the city in this whole state that wishes this Mayor would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 become one of the best that Scranton has ever had in its history and years to come. But I just don't see how she can. She's -- she's indifferent to the populous . The City Codes mean nothing to her. She got an administration made out of friends and support ers. What she needs as much as I hate to say is, she needs Bulzonis and a whole bunch of them in that administration . But that won't happen, I guess. You can't -- I don't think you can fire your friends very easily like -- let's just take Oleski that I had my run-in problem with. A couple months ago Council sent me -- gave me a letter stating all of the things that they done. Do you remember that? I told you then not a one of them had been addressed . To this very minute not one of them been addressed , but on the letter it said it was all over. It had been taken care of, all the cars have been removed . That's what I have to deal with the City Council . For the fun of it, I parked one of my cars on a piece of city property sideways 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 across from my house, I don't know, for a week and a half. I didn't get a ticket or nothing . It should have been ticketed . This is your property . This is their property . That's just how the city is. Maybe tomorrow they're going to tell me to move it or something . What we need -- we need more people from this city to come to these meeting s. This city is just turned into -- it's not -- it's not a city anymore. It's like a little jerkwater town that's a bump in the road to New York. We need to turn it into a city again like have events and all of that like you see on television for Wilkes-Barre and Stroudsburg . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. JEFFRIES : Hi, Norma Jeffries, Scranton resident . And I took notes as I was listening to different things since I came into the room. And the first thing that I wanted to address was Weston Park and that they are opening their pool. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 I was out there on Saturday to a graduation party. And what a great feel that is and it gave me such longing s to my park which is Nay Aug to look like Weston Park. The grass was all mowed and everything was in tiptop shape. The pool was ready to go. It was just so blue and rippling as the filters and everything and the kids were there. They weren't at the pool because it wasn't open. But the grown -- and the kids that were at the party that I was at and everyone had such a great time. And that community room out there is excellent and had a great time out there. So, you know, I couldn't help think about Nay Aug Park and maybe one day I'll be able to sit and look at our pool with the rippling blue waters and that the kids will be able to enjoy the environment that's there for them. I know that their pool is now open and I just wish them a wonderful summer and that they be safe and maybe we could have one similar to that over the coming years at Nay Aug Park. I know there's studies going on and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 things like that. But how many more studies can we have before we see something that was there. I was up at the park the other day and I got so excited because they were surveying and I thought , oh, good. They're getting ready to do something . But that wasn't for the park. It was for -- I think was for some kind of other field that they are thinking about putting in there but nothing for the pool. The second thing that I wanted to address was a thank you to the newspaper . As a kid when school was over the first thing we did on vacation was go to vacation Bible school. And that was right after we got finished with our studies at school. And this morning 's paper there was a wonderful article in there on Elm Park and their vacation Bible school. And I thought what a great thing to turn to page three and see something so positive because surrounding those picture s that they had of Elm Park were someone being arrested for drugs and sex and, you know, all of those things that are so depressing .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 And just to see that wonderful article on Elm Park on page three, it was in color too. It was just so uplifting for me to know that they're still having vacation Bible school that they had Pine Street Baptist Church when I was a kid. So thank you and kudos to the Times for running that story. And also the third thing I'm addressing and spending my time, you probably wonder us retiree people, Joan and Marie probably come down here to City Hall. But what I've been doing is reading on the Home Rule Charter , the Home Rule Charter . And that's quite a document . And I have it on my computer and I pull it up and I bookmark where I finish reading it and to continue reading it and you say why am I reading that? What I'm looking for, I want to know about the residency rules for employment . And I want to know -- not from Council but I want to see it in writing exactly what it says about that because in working in HR as I did before -- you know, once you do something you're setting precedent . And we always try not to do anything to set a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 precedent . And it just seems like a precedent is being set. So I just wanted to see what the Home Rule Charter says about that. As soon as I finish reading it and find out what I'm looking for, I will be back to address that. But I just want to thank you again for, I guess, it's the department of -- I guess it's your department , Mr. Smurl, that takes care of the parks and all. I'm not sure which one does it. But that park out there at Weston Park and I hope the kids enjoy it and have a wonderful summer. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Tonight is a little bit of paperwork here. First off, I want to address 7-C on the docket. I notice there is a notice on 7-C that the Fire Chief is the one that will decide if anyone can perform a First Amendment activity for -- it's the document on the flag burning in public. It will be interesting to see how compelling someone to produce incriminating 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 statements in violation of Fifth Amendment right will be in conflict with banning a First Amendment right. When you have to give over information that could be possibly used to attack you for using your First Amendment right when you're compelled to do so, you are put in a double bind between the Fifth Amendment and the First Amendment . It think that's going to be a great tool to push a city liability in this. I really don't think it's a good idea to put this forward in any form and just leave it under the public safety rather than a specific cutout. And if I plan to protest on Monday morning , is the Chief going to be available on Saturday to hand out those documents ? Because if I have two days beforehand and it's a Monday morning , I guess that Chief needs to be in the office on Saturday so I could get my proper documentation two days beforehand. As of -- moving onto 7-I, 7-I is on the Planning Commission . It should be denied not only because the person Koni has absolutely no experience in the field, she's a member -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 she's done accounting and cosmetology . It has nothing in benefit of the Planning Commission whatsoever . Secondary is the fact that using Koni as her name is not her legal name. And I looked at the documentation and code enforcement specifically looks and says that they looked at the database for real estate trash and code enforce ment and it used the name Koni. Well, since that's not her legal name, I'm not sure they would find anything in that. I'm not sure why someone is applying to the City of Scranton and putting in applications using a pseudonym rather than an actual legal name. 5-G, which is the going out -- for the public use of commercial lands for -- public lands for commercial entity. I understand that during the emergency for Covid we allowed business es and restaurant s to encroach upon the public streets. I don't think it should be an extended right. As a matter of fact, if they are going do this, it shouldn 't be a fee for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 just a permit for this allowing them to do it. Since they are encroaching over a temporary 30-day period and there is no longer an emergency , it basically is leasing that property to that business . And in effect you are selling them the right to use city property for a business purpose . They should be taxed on it. They should be taxed in property tax because they are now renting it. And as a matter of fact, why not hit them with a renter tax as well because if we start giving city streets over which are public properties to private entities for profit, why shouldn 't they have to pay for that benefit that they've absorbed ? 5-H, fireworks , 150 foot is interesting on it. It's from any vehicle or building whether occupied or not. That excludes just about everywhere . There is a problem with the bill though as 2453 puts allowed times. One of the restrictions on it has a -- we have a time for the Fourth of July. The act is written in Sections 2 and 3 notes that you also put limitations on Memorial Day 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 and Labor Day. As in the State Code in the backup, that is not allowed under Act 47. Specific time periods were put in for the Fourth of July. As a matter of fact, it says noted in the header except the authority under this: No municipality shall restrict or regulate fireworks on Memorial Day or Labor Day. So the time exception is put in there specifically for those dates violate the state ordinance . And I have more to say. I'll come back another day. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I'm going up and down a street or through a court, I've noticed a lot of goods set out for trash that looked like they are very useable. And what my suggestion is, get in touch with the Salvation Army or the Good Will and donate it. It's just a shame a couple years ago I saw a large cooler. And it was filled with water. So it wasn't leaking like a picnic cooler type thing. And, you know, you see so many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 useable items just tossed out to the curb for trash. And that cooler carried a price of something similar about $60. So, you know, let somebody else have it. Salvation Army I picked up a VCR. All my VCRs crapped out. I picked one up for 10 bucks and it works, you know, grand. The median for that is a great deal more. And on this overtime business here, it's -- the only thing we really need to do is to justify what it's spent or why it's spent. If there is some kind of emergency and this throwing around innuendos about orientations or what somebody did 30 years ago or 50 years ago or whatever , it kind of makes me sick. It just makes me outright sick. I'm sick and tired of the -- almost to a point of criminal , you know, last Mayor we had the landlords got a great break. They got trash fees for the same price as I do. They could have four tenants piled up there. And they got a trash fee. And the guy before that is in prison. And the guy before that I heard -- and it may be a rumor, but Mr. Courtright was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 arrested two days after the statute of limitations ran out on the Doherty business . So, you know, let's not all pull our pants down in public here because you might not find you're endowed as what you think. Now, I'm going stay on this for quite a while in the future. And this is on tax exempts and the pilots. First of all, the pilots are only a fraction , a small fraction , 5 percent , maybe 7, maybe 4 of what the tax loss is. And there certainly are fire and police and paving streets and whatever on top of it, expenses , all of the municipal expenses . And what I would suggest they should be happy to do it. If they don't have the money or if somebody is going to have to go without a meal down at the soup kitchen then sign up on a petition to be delivered to the state because all of this talk about swimming pools and stuff like that, I'm mainly concern ed about taxes. If somebody wants to have a park and make a bunch of rules I don't want to abide by, I don't get off on arguing with a police officer about the law, I just don't go, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 know, and that's it. Somebody else wants to go, fine. If you could build a swimming pool without jacking my taxes up like the county did with that stupid baseball field, it's 12 bucks to park now. It was a 1.50 more for me to get in to see a baseball game, the Philharmonic and fireworks . And then on top of it, there is a hardly a crack in that concrete in that stadium and now it's 12 bucks to park on top of it. So, I mean, and then 38 percent increase , sorry about that -- increase is property taxes from the county, that type of stuff, you're right. Then I don't need it. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Virgil Argenta , being that nobody took me up on my offer the last couple weeks, can I bring something up? MR. KING: Sure. Thank you. MR. ARGENTA : Drinking in public parks, is it certain parks that have this rule or is it all parks are banned from it? And if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 I may give you some more reading material , if there's a promoter that's promoting that, it's turning into a fair as could you see. The Parks and Recreation trailers are turning into bike ramps and seesaws during Saturdays and Sundays. The dumpster is overflowing with plantations , plantains, bananas , street corn. I broke up some bags loaded with beers and beer bottles. There's multiple food vendors . Now there's prop vendors with T-shirts and hats. There's grills all over the place. You can't walk the track. As like I said, Saturday and Sunday evening s it's totally uncomfortable to even go there. We just don't fit in. The alcohol ic beverages , everybody 's drinking , rowdy. There's soccer games all over. With a crowd of this magnitude , usually there's a police officer working special duty shift and/or a fire marshall. I don't see either of those there. I went there Sunday morning after the festivities . Well, it was Monday, June 19th I went there. And the parking lot is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 pitiful. The grease is all over the place. There's bottles , cans. Our Parks and Recreations Department shouldn 't be picking this up. If this is a festival and there's a promote r and the promoter is charging for space, let alone the drinking -- and when these people get together and different cultures and they're drinking and playing their games and whatever , that's a recipe for disaster . And we all know that Weston Field has its own problem s with the shootings , the stabbing s, and other incident s that are taking place there. We don't need more. And this is a quality park for all of us. And a Saturday and a Sunday afternoon and evening , definitely not for us. So if there's a promoter involved , we need to look into it. If there's food vendors and they don't have a health license and they are not paying their fair shares, we need to look into that. The alcoholic beverage s, if they're going to drink there, we need a police officer on site. It's not fair to the residents of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 the Weston Field area and it's not fair to the resident s of the city who frequent Weston Field. And if the pool opens and they are having these bizarres and these get-together s, is the pool going to be inundated with this as well? I mean, we need to seriously look into this. The dumpster 's overflowing and they're having their bizarre s. We taxpayer s pay for that. The job Johnnys that they don't appreciate that are tipped over, we pay for that. Those wagons that the Parks and Recreation use to haul the machine around to do the other parks and keep them pristine , we pay for those. And if they are going to come in here and act like heathens and animals , shut it down, simple as that. I asked last week if there's a inventory list on city properties . Mr. King, do we have an inventory list? And if you can look into that for me, please, I'd appreciate that. MR. KING: Inventory list on? MR. ARGENTA : City properties , city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 vacant lots, anything at all that the city owns that's a property so that I could personal ly go out and do my walking tour because you guys evidently are too busy to take a walking tour with me. MR. KING: City vacant lots. MR. ARGENTA : Yes, sir. MR. KING: If we can -- MR. ARGENTA : And also properties , like, we're having an issue with that Mylert Street that mister -- so we could put some clarity on who owns that. And then another thing I noticed as I was in the parks, there's city vehicle s all over the place. Do we have a motor pool or inventory of the vehicles and one set location where the vehicles should be? We have those carts that kids are using as bike ramps, put them all together somewhere . There's two pickup trucks there. There's a pickup truck in front of the place. There's pickup trucks at people's homes. Do we know what we have? Do we know what they're being used for? Also, if we have an inventory list of the vehicle s, that would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 be greatly appreciated . Secondly , while I have some more time, the neighbor s have been inundating me with fire calls and everybody seems to be getting outrageous bills for fire calls. If the Mayor is going to implement and come up with all of these program , have the Mayor come to the meeting s here so that she don't answer to you people. Let her answer to us. Let us question her. If all of these implement ations that she's putting in and thinks they're good for us and speaks for us, then come here, let us ask you about it and you explain to us because she's certainly not answering to you guys so maybe she'll answer to us. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Have a good night, guys. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Yes, sir. MR. MCANDREW : I'm going to address the structural fire fees that are being charged in Fifth Order. MR. ARGENTA : Thank you. And also 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 the parks if you could look at the alcoholic beverages , please. MR. MCANDREW : Sure. MR. ARGENTA : Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . Last week there was quite a bit of discussion on items that would probably be resolved or at least further discussed at the municipal recreation meeting which was to be held on Thursday . Does anybody know why when we got there to go it just said it was cancelled ? MR. SMURL: I was told there was lack of a quorum. MS. SCHUMACHER : That was before the start of the -- the time of the start. That doesn't -- MR. SMURL: That's the e-mail I received . MS. SCHUMACHER : Something is wrong. Maybe they didn't want to discuss the things that were going to be discussed . I don't know, but that's not right. Now, has the Environmental Advisory Board been established 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 yet? I would like to see what these people are suppose d to be doing once they get on and how many people have been -- you voted on so they could get -- I guess that's what they are waiting for is enough people -- MR. KING: So far we've named three, correct ? The administration has named three and Council plans to introduce two names shortly . MS. SCHUMACHER : When will we see what you are appointing them to? MR. KING: What do you mean? City Council has the right to name two members to the five member environmental -- MS. SCHUMACHER : I think that's fine. But what is the advisory board -- what are they authorized to do? MR. KING: Well, they are strictly advisory . MS. SCHUMACHER : Advisory to Council or advisory to the entire city or what? MR. KING: I believe to the administration and to Council . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Now, I want 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 to just let you know in case you don't read the legal notices that there is a Scranton Sewer Authority Board meeting on Thursday I believe -- yeah, at 5:30 in the Governor 's room. I mean, I'm beginning to think perhaps it is time to decide whether it's -- whether the advisory board is still needed or is it just going to go until all the money that is in escrow has been spent and then it will just collapse . I don't know. But I think it's time for some discussion . And then I would like to know more on Serrenti . I mean, I went there and nothing , you know, it was not obvious as to what is happening there. Mr. McAndrew , I know you were in something in I believe it was January of this year. But, you know, what is happening there? Why don't we get a report on what -- what's there? And why -- I thought when that was establish ed I really thought that was going to be our safety building . But now last week you have made another -- another place for the fire department . And apparently Serrenti is only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 going to be policed . And do with we have a budget for the Rockwell facility ? MR. MCANDREW : They just applied for a grant. MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon? MR. MCANDREW : They just applied for a grant. MS. SCHUMACHER : I didn't hear it. MR. MCANDREW : A grant was applied for two weeks ago in the legislation . I'll get you an update on Serrenti too in Fifth Order. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, I would like to know how much they're going to be using. And then who in the state -- you put it -- sent it to the paving of the barrier on the Spruce Street bridge to the state. Nothing has happened on the railroad -- the bridge side. South Scranton as Tom talked about before, there is reflectors on like probably every 6 feet and the end is all painted yellow. Nothing has happened on the Central City portion so -- except that it's been sent to the state to do it. Now, who do we contact at the state to nag so something happens ? MR. KING: Frank, did we ever get an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 answer? I know we inquired about that. MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, we do. PennDOT in Dunmore , Mr. Wasilchak is handling it and they should start that soon. I'll get a timeline , Marie. MR. KING: Okay. So it sounds like they are going to start that soon, PennDOT in Dunmore . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. KOLOSKI : Good evening , Council , Doris Koloski , Scranton resident . I'm going to be really quick. I just want to go over a few things. The curb -- the cut down at the curb at Olive Street and Colfax Avenue has never been done. So I just wanted to have that double-checked on. I also would like to get if there is any update on 421 Colfax, the Olivetti property that -- somebody has been cutting the grass I could see. But that's that abandoned house on Colfax with all the rodents living in it. And I was just kind of wondering if there was any updates on that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 MR. KING: Doris, what's the address of that? MS. KOLOSKI : 421 Colfax. I also wanted to clarify something on the city waivers when you live out of the city but you could work in the city. I was always under the impression if your job was paid by city taxes, you had to live in city because otherwise you would have no reason not to want to strike for more wages and such kind of stuff. So I was just -- when did that all start? Was I just asleep at the wheel because I thought I saw something like maybe 20 years ago about a policeman that wanted to live out of the city and I thought it was denied. So I'd just like some clarification on what that's all about. And last thing is the bus that I spoke about, the shelter for the bus on Mulberry and maybe any other bus stops too. Has anybody heard anything about that? And while I'm on buses for some reason -- I don't know if I just dreamt it one night or if I saw it in the paper like I thought that there was going to be kind of big meeting between the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 transit company and the city about revising schedules and getting new buses. And I was wondering if I just made all of that up in my head, like, or if that's true. And if it is true, input should be to get those buses on a schedule that people could actually ride them work -- like hours if they wanted to go to work at the mall or downtown , they could actually get a bus that gets you there around the time work opens and buses that come around the time work closes since basically we have no real public transportation . And I just came from a place that had like the most phenomenal public transportation system that I ever saw in my whole life and made me thinking about Scranton even more. But I do know that they never run on the schedule . At least they didn't -- businesses because people that worked for me before I retired, those people sometimes had to ride a bus, had to leave work 10 minutes early to get a bus. And we quit at 5:00 or -- and the bus came right on our corner on Capouse Avenue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 or they had to come into work 10 or 15 minutes late or 15 minutes before the door opens because of the bus schedule . So if there is going to be something where the transit authority when they get their new buses is going to take a look at the whole programming of how the buses sync with their transfers with the city, I think maybe it's something City Council should look into to make sure that maybe it does sync up with what people need. And that's it. Have a good night. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Doris. You too. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5 A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. First is 6-A this evening we're going to be voting on permits , fee schedule for licensing and inspection . That has been completely done over. And it has all of the inspection fees and permit fees. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 So this was very helpful for contractors and for homeowners because we were very high on our inspection rates for the City of Scranton . Second is we received a letter from East Mountain resident s. It didn't include anyone's name or contact information . So I sent the following request to Director Pietreface to cover what was requested . They asked the storm catch basins be cleaned. So I asked if they'd send the street cleaner up to clean the storm basins up and also do -- pretty much go up and do the entire mountain and try to get the garbage out of all the storm drains that are blocked . And they say that there's brush growing out past the sidewalks out to the curb line. I believe this may be the same stuff that's at Nay Aug Park. I believe it's called Japanese knotweed or something like that. But the city has a brand new machine that includes what's called a flail arm. It goes off the side and you could actually -- it's designed specifically to take care of all of this overgrowth . So I requested that to be sent up to East Mountain and their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 final request was the lot at Meadow Avenue and River Street they request be cleaned. But I believe that lot is privately owned, but I had asked Mr. Voldenberg to look into that for us. Second thing is, 812 Fellows Street is condemned . It's been condemn ed for a long time. Actually the condemnation is pretty much faded away. So I'm looking to find if that is privately owned. Also 8th Avenue and Fellows Street, this is a giant property , overgrown. There is some old vehicles in there and stuff. So I gave Mr. Voldenberg copies of this request . I want to find out if this is a Land Bank property or if it is privately owned so that we could know how to move forward on that. Also, last week we did some work up in the Hill Section . And I want to thank Mike from code enforce ment and Corporal Ianuzzo from Scranton Police Department . They removed some vehicle s, some tents that were over these vehicles from 520 Harrison Avenue which is a city property . They told me that the rest of the tent and the vehicles were removed -- will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 removed by tomorrow . They also removed an old disable d camper from the 900 block of Quincy Avenue. I don't know how long it was there, but that's been removed . Last week I had mentioned an RFP for a FEMA project to remove sediment from up at -- across from the East Scranton baseball field. And then I gotten calls for the rest of the them when they were going to be done. And I didn't notice the rest of them but I did look and there was an RFP out this weekend for more sediment debris removal that all these RFPs are due back by July 10. They include Leggett 's Creek, that's site number 27 by Bloom Avenue; site number 28, Leggett 's Creek by Rockwell Avenue; site number 13 is Keyser Creek by Simplex ; number 18, Leggett 's Creek by Hollow Avenue bridge and number 10, Lindy Creek by Washburn Street bridge and Lindy Creek along Freight Street. I believe these are all FEMA project s. And I believe there's time limits on these. So hopefully we could move forward with all of these. I know they are out for RFPs. So the residency waivers for the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 Scranton that we're talking about, the City of Scranton averages about 651 employees . The number of waivers that is -- that are currently being used is three. I don't think Council has handed out waivers for residents really just hand them to anyone. I believe every Mayor should choose their own cabinet members , department heads, and attorneys and naturally as long as they're qualified for the position . And I say if we have two applicants that are qualified for the same position and one lives in the city, I would hope that the Mayor at that time would appoint the city resident . But as in the past, I've seen we've only gotten applicants from people that live outside of the city for a certain position that was filled recently . I see no other choice but to provide a waiver so that we could fill that position . And my last thing is the overtime legislation , I believe the overtime legislation we have needs to be amended a bit. I think everyone should be able to review all of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 overtime . Although in some cases where it may affect the well-being of certain employees by giving their names or what department they work for, I think that needs to be addressed so that doesn't get out to where it doesn't need to be. There is software that exits that could do the tracking of all of this overtime and make it safe for all employees . I know the police and fire department do a good job. They do their own overtime reports and no one seems to have any problems with that. But the legislation we have if we pass that, that will be like a blanket legislation . That covers everybody so I don't know if that would make it unsafe for anyone else in other department s that if we don't include that in it. But I think we need to explore how to get or implement the software for overtime that we could just ask for a report and it could be printed out for us. That's all I have, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 things. I guess I'll start with the overtime legislation . Last week I suggest ed that we keep it on the table and we -- the offer was extended to the administration and the Law Department to send over their concerns , any kind of amendments they might want to have. And, Mr. Voldenberg and Mr. Gallagher, have we received anything from the Law Department on our overtime legislation ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as of today, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : This is what I assumed would happen because I don't think there's going to be any movement on this. My -- to get the software implement ed, we're going to have put out new RFPs. We're going to have to get new contracts . We're going to have to get the software installed . That's going to take some time. That was what was suggested by the administration . Like I said, I fear that we're not going to get any movement on this. I would like to see what their suggestion s are, what their concerns are. But at this point in time we haven't heard any official concerns from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 them. So it doesn't seem that they're working with us for a compromise . Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask about how many FEMA project s we have if we could get those listed those FEMA projects . I know Mr. Smurl listed off a few, but just an updated list and timeline of where we're at so we could make sure we're addressing them as a city by December of this year because that is the deadline for that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I could do that, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : I do know that file of Council No. 49 is going to be brought up tonight . So maybe at some point later I might have something to throw in on that one with our fire department and the billing that we've been seeing lately. I should have started off with this. But I would like to thank the Scranton Fire Department with their efforts to rescue an individual that fell into the Roaring Brook in the last few days. Great job with that one. I would like to send my condolences 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 to the family of John Derenick of Taylor. Mr. Derenick served in the US Army for 39 years. He attained the rank of Chief Warrant Officer four and he had passed away just recently . We did receive some e-mails about the storm drain on Dale Avenue and also Grandview and Capouse Avenue with sewer lids and storm drains. My e-mail was not working . I tried to get that stuff forwarded over but I know I think we all got it. Did that get forward ed along to the correct individual ? MR. VOLDENBERG : It was. It was forward ed. And we also got information on the Dale Drive project . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : It's going to take place shortly . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. There was a request for East Mountain drain basins. I think while we're at East Mountain , I don't know if it would be most appropriate to just make a request that if we send over to DPW to take a look at the drain basins and runoff basins in West Mountain . We do have problems with those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 basins every year when the heavier rains come. But if they haven't been scheduled if we could possibly get that scheduled . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I'm going to run through several items that I requested last week and the previous weeks. I asked for a list of non resident city employees . I know the percentage that we were given was .8 percent . Did we get a list on non resident city employees , Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as of today. I expect that list tomorrow when the HR Director returns . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. The Weston Field bathhouse, two weeks ago there was a study that was going to be taking place. And we asked for an update on the bathhouse . Did we get any kind of official update on the bathhouse? MR. VOLDENBERG : I didn't. I should receive a write-up from the Parks Director . I don't have it as of today. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. I also asked for the Licensing and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 Inspections Department on permits, what the average turnover time for processing permits and requests are and things of that nature. Have we received anything on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : Turnover time is two to three days ideally unless there's exceptions . MR. SCHUSTER : Unless there's what? MR. VOLDENBERG : Exceptions . MR. SCHUSTER : Oh, exceptions . Thank you. Other than that, the 300 block of Putnam, if we can keep that on the list of things to address . I know I put that in a couple times; 502-504 West Gibson, the fire update on that residence and then 736-738 Prescott Avenue. I didn't see any information back on those address es or properties . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get you a status on all three. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you very much, Mr. Voldenberg . That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. First, I wanted to mention I think Councilman King is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 going to be going into it further that we did receive an update that was requested from Dr. Saxena regarding what activities her office has performed since we last received an update from her. So I would like to ask that that be included in Third Order for next week. And I sent a number of concerns , properties and complaints that I had receive d to Mr. Voldenberg . One of them that I did want to add and I think it was also brought up here tonight was along the 500 block of Myrtle and this has been a problem property in the past. And there was some debate as to who had ownership of the property , where the property lines were. It had a boat that goes out into the street and a lot of weeds and greenery and encroaching into the street. And so that boat had been removed and I think it was cleaned up a little bit. But I'm not sure who did that and it definitely needs to be cleaned up again. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And I'd also received another complaint regarding 718 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Taylor Avenue that despite -- despite code enforcement and zoning visiting the property before and giving them a stop work order that they were continuing to work on the property especially in the evenings . And so I requested that code enforce ment once again visit the property to confirm if continued work is occurring. Did we receive an update or reply on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet, Dr. Rothchild . But Mr. King -- Don King is working on that with the property owner. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. And there were a number of traffic and parking studies that I've requested in the past and I don't believe I received any response on. So I also provided a list of those. And so the ones that I wanted to check on included the traffic study at Harrison Avenue and the Mulberry Street intersection to determine if a left turn signal was needed to turn onto Harrison and a parking study on the 800 block of East Gibson Street near the (inaudible ) to determine if permit parking was still appropriate to be there. MR. VOLDENBERG : That was approved 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 this afternoon by the traffic officer . I forward ed it to the Chief and it's on its way to the legal department . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Great. And traffic study to take place up in North Scranton like Reese Street and Greenbush area. MR. VOLDENBERG : I spoke with Officer Ianuzzo , the traffic officer today and he said he'd follow up with patrol. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, yes, and we did also ask for patrols to be there because there was, I believe , like a preschool located in that area and a lot of frequent speeding , run the stop signs, peopling going up the one way the wrong way. And the residents had also requested the signage be replaced so that it's more clear to drivers that it is a one way. So those were some of the concerns over on that street. And one of the questions that I have for SPD was in the past -- and I've asked it multiple times if parking tickets had been given to people illegal ly parked in handicap spots downtown in the evenings and on the weekends . And I don't believe we received a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 response on if that's occurring . And, if so, how many parking tickets have been given? MR. VOLDENBERG : No report as of yet on that, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. So I would like to ask for that again. And then I know that we had heard the other week that there was going to be some movement on changing over those handicap parking signs, line painting , curb painting to make the handicap spots more obvious . But I haven't heard anything further and I would like to know if there's a date for when that's planned. I haven't really received further detail on it. And it's frustrating that I've been asking for months and months about that and from the complaint s that I've received from resident s downtown who want to be able to use that handicap parking . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up on that also. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And I think that's all I have for this evening . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have two. I'll start off with two quality of life issues, the first 734 East Locust Street. This is a problem for years. There's a poor lady that lives near there that says this property is dilapidated and it's been abandoned for years. There's garbage in the yard. There's been gang activity , gang graffiti being spray painted in this -- on this property within the property . And also there's -- there is -- there has been incident reports . So this property continues to be a problem and, you know, the neighbors are concerned nothing is being done. And I feel for them because like it was stated to me, this has been going on for years. So can we please look into that one, check on the incident reports . And even like some of the neighbors said there was an elderly women yelling at these kids. And I give her a lot of credit but she probably shouldn 't be -- you know, this is gang activity related stuff. She should probably be careful of that. So it's becoming an issue more than just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 blight, okay? And then next 1305 South Irving is another abandon ed property with very high grass. And it hasn't been taken care of. Also to Mr. Argenta 's point about Weston Field. No one likes to have a good time more than me. But if there is behavior that's going on there on weekend s and there's festivals that, you know, with food vendors of the health, safety, and welfare of all of our resident s, I hope they have their license . I hope they're following procedure s of the city, you know, alcohol on a public park is not allowed . So this should not be allowed and garbage , I mean, you know, I hope there is enough receptacles there. But if they're not -- somebody needs to take a look at this, the new Parks Director and the police department . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Also related to that, we'd like an update on the Serrenti Center for Miss Schumacher . And overtime legislation , the administration has had a copy of that for three 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 weeks. They're complaining that it needs to be amended . I think we all agree it needs to be amended. But it's not going to be amended until they provide us with the information we asked for. This why I didn't want to table it last week. That would force them to provide the amendment s they seek. No, it sits on the table because they don't want it, period. All right. So and then next, so for the past couple months I received pictures of bills to homeowners that -- and God love them, that had a fire, a structural fire. They're provided bills by the fire department . We had a caucus here with Chief Judge maybe two months ago, and he told me that there's an ordinance that allows it. I'm like okay. I never heard it. I talked to firefighter s. They said we just started doing this. They don't want to do it and I feel for them, but it's part of their job that they have to populate a little bill and send it to the resident or send it to administration . But it's -- everybody I talked to said they never heard of it, right, so Chief 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Judge informed us at caucus, oh, this has been going on as long as I'm on the fire department . So I said okay. And I received some more bills, right, this is becoming -- it's happening often. And we pay taxes for, you know, the fire department and God willing none of us have a fire; but that's why we pay taxes. So the bill I received here, right, from somebody who recently got this had a mulch fire on their property . I don't even know if they called the fire department . Maybe a neighbor did, but that's okay. The fire department shows up and puts it out with the resident 's hose and then provide s a bill with a list of charges. I'm not going to go through them all but the bill is $2,300, all right. So there's something -- there's a problem here. So with that said, I said you know what, let me take a look at the ordinance because we did pass an ordinance in '21, and that's File of Council No. 49. This is an amended ordinance to the one with -- of 2000, right, the only thing stated on this ordinance and this was discussed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 in caucus is, oh, we just increase d the fee. And I get that. So you are amending this from 2000 to 2021. And they're, you know, they're restructuring the fees and increasing them. But in this legislation , the fees only relate to -- I'm not going to read the whole ordinance . But in the event there is an automobile accident in the city and there's fluids, you know, that are spilled . I get that. I'm okay with that if the fire department comes, make sure it's safe, no one -- doesn't catch on fire, make sure this is taken care in a safe manner. And you know what, bill them. The car insurance should pay for this. I'm okay with that because this could be delivery truck from out of town. It's not always a resident that incurs this, right, so I was okay with this, right? So then I started seeing these bills again. So nowhere in this ordinance cites the word structure . So I thought let me go back because this was amended from 2000. So I go back to the 2000 ordinance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 No. 47, pretty much says the same thing that, you know, the jaws of life, apparatuses like that. This is -- this fee schedule is for vehicle accidents , you know, and emergencies related to vehicles in the city, right? And, you know, the charges are here; and that's how they're going to be charged , which again, I'm okay with that. But guess what, the bill that people are getting on the bottom says incident type, structural fire response , location , blah, blah, blah. Ordinance info as per the City of Scranton File of Council No. 49 ordinance . It's not there. It's vehicles . This is structure , right? So I go back a little farther . You know, maybe, I don't know, maybe I missed something . Maybe they missed something . This one cites 49 which is the newest one, that's 2021. The only thing that's been amended in the 2021 one is the rates. They increase d and we get that but only for vehicle emergencies , nothing about structure , right? So I thought , okay, let me go back to 1999. I go back to 1999, the original ordinance . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 Structure is not in here. It's basically vehicles . All right. And we're okay with that like we said. But the problem I have now is, I'm only hearing about it -- most people are only hearing about it now. And to be told that this has been common practice all the way back to 1999, I'm not the buying it. I'm sorry. And we did reach out today and what did the Chief say? Oh, it's something we always do, right, normally do. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , sir. MR. MCANDREW : I'm sorry, to me and I hate to say this, it looks like a money grab. All right. It's never been done before. Okay, maybe someone can come back to me and say, you know, we meant to do it in '99 and it was never enforce d. I could even buy that. But to have the original ordinance , two amended ordinance that don't refer to vehicle -- I'm sorry, don't refer to structure fires, only vehicle and all of a sudden people are getting billed now maybe in the last year, it's not fair to the resident s of Scranton .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 They're not aware of it. And then we're told which doesn't make any sense during caucus, well, this company collects , you know, the money for us. And it's used for apparatus and equipment , which that's fine if it's just for vehicles only, fires. But we're told in caucus, well, if the resident doesn't pay it we don't put them in collections . So I don't understand . So what I want to know in closing , I want to know is this has been common practice since all the way back to '99, I want to see proof of that. I want to see bills for the past 10 years that have been given to resident s for structural fires because I don't believe they exist. And if I'm wrong, I'll apologize and admit that I am. But I just never heard of it and neither have the residents . So they are the ones we're here for. They're the ones we're sticking up for, so please get that information . MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. McAndrew , can I also throw in there the billing references File of Council 49 on the billing itself. Can we also ask the Law Department if they could give 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 us their justification as how we can bill resident s according to this ordinance ? MR. MCANDREW : Sure. I like to listen to everybody . It should be fun. MR. KING: Is that it, Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : That is all I have. MR. SCHUSTER : Can I add one more thing? So we have an agency that collects . Does that collection agency go back to 1999 -- it only goes back to 2014. How many bills have they sent out through that collection agency and what years those contracts were renewed ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew , Mr. Schuster . Just some follow up from some speakers last week, there was a Michael Passero . Per Andrew Sunday, code enforce ment manager , the West Side inspector s will be focusing on the below properties and other issues which would have been Friday, June 16. City Council followed up on all the properties for status and resolution . Those areas were the thousand block of Oxford Street. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 It looks like South Edwards Court behind the post office; under Railroad bridge on Luzerne Street near Bellevue section ; a group of homes on Bellevue side of Railroad bridge, junk car on the corner and trash behind the homes; the Dollar General on Meridian Avenue and the area surrounding Sunoco station at the corner of South Main and Division Streets if we can get an update. It sounds like code enforcement was there on Friday. MR. VOLDENBERG : They were, sir. I'll get an update. MR. KING: Thank you very much. Scott Thomas, CEO, Scranton Public Library , the no parking sign at the library book drop unit was removed by ABM and placed parking kiosks on that block. Daniel Boland, ABM parking coordinator is reviewing the removal of parking spots to allow easy vehicle access for book drop off. The DPW will then replace with no parking sign. We did receive the City Public Health Coordinator work summary and we'll ask to put that in Third Order for next week. Damaged drain at Capouse Avenue and Grandview 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 Street. We asked for our DPW team to please review and advise the status on the drain at the corner of Capouse Avenue and Grandview Street. Also ask for DPW to please advise a timeline on repairs. Also spoke to the Mayor this afternoon , talked a little bit Rubicon . She indicated that she has a meeting tomorrow with DPW. She indicated that the new routes started on June 14 which would have been last Wednesday . I also asked her to increase the police presence at Nay Aug Park. There was some concern express ed about the number of people starting to utilize the gorge. And as we found out, you know, our fire department , probably and emergency certified people were down in the gorge. An individual had to be rescued . That individual I think -- I don't know what that individual was doing, but I think came off of the expressway and somehow ended up in the gorge. I'm talking more about the swimmer s, people starting to head into the Nay Aug gorge and how many people have died through the years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 swimming and diving in the Nay Aug gorge. So the Mayor indicated to me that they do have signage there. They have cameras . But I asked her if she could increase the police presence , especially on warmer days where it's likely to increase where people are likely to get down in there. We will contact Single Tax Office concerning the property tax database updates along the trash fees that Joan had mention ed early. That hasn't been updated since February of '23. The HUP test -- there were no bidders . They'll do a second bid and try to increase their advertisement to try to get someone to bid on that HUP test, which will really go out and evaluate the pilots in the city. So hopefully we could get interested parties in doing that. The one concern I have tonight that the one individual that is being named, did we ever get an answer -- I think the person's name is Koni Barrett {sic} and it was mention ed earlier . I don't know that we have an actual address of that individual . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 I think it has a list -- it's listed as a work address . So the question is, does she live at the business ? And, if not, where in the city does she live? So I just want to see if we could get clarification on that. Street signs, where are we. The Mayor is meeting with the DPW tomorrow . She seems to be very concerned about this that it's not moving at the rate that she would like it to be. I said that's good because it's not moving at the rate that we would like to see. So hopefully , you know, they develop a plan as to how they're going to get those street signs out ASAP. She did indicate that overtime, they're working on establishing a reporting system and each employee will end up with an employee ID number. So apparently that's a work in progress . I mentioned something to her about the burn ban. And she said in reviewing with Council , she indicated that this burn ban actually enhance s our compliance with the First Amendment . You know, there was some comment s made earlier this evening that we're a 3-2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 Council and a number of us are just here to support the Mayor. All I could tell you about that is I've sat on this Council through 3-2 votes. I've sat here for 4-1 votes. I've sat here for 5-0 votes. I think the last thing that people in the city want are 5-0 votes across the board every single time there's a vote. And granted, the majority of our votes are 5-0. A lot of us, you know, I said this before, I'll say it again. We don't always agree on everything . Sometimes we generally agree but maybe in how things are being implemented we might disagree which would be 3-2 or 4-1 votes. That's the case. You know, for those that don't like, you know, the way that I vote or somebody else might vote, my advice is go out, get signatures , run for the seat and come up and serve on City Council . I would encourage that. I really would. This is the first time I've ever, you know, run for a public office. And I'm sitting up here. You know, we have to make difficult decision s and sometimes people aren't happy with them. Just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 because I vote a certain way doesn't mean that it's wrong because someone else disagrees with that. You know, at the end of the day -- I've said this before, I believe that every one of us up here has the best interest of the city, you know, in mind when we do take votes. In terms of tabling that legislation on the overtime , I do have some concerns . I do support , you know, overtime legislation . I just want to make sure that it's passed and implemented properly so that we don't end up getting ourselves jammed up legally . So, you know, that having been said, hopefully we do get the adjustment s or changes made from the administration so that we could ultimately move that legislation forward . And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm happy to see these pieces of legislation come to us tonight because I think it's really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 important for us to be able to make these changes or to make it safer for the schools . And we've receive d a number of complaint s not just near this school but from other schools requesting traffic studies because of complaint s of frequent speeding of vehicles . And I know we all want to do what we can to make it safer for students to be able to cross and to limit speeding into these areas. So I would caution drivers when you are driving near a school, please be careful of the kids and of your -- your speeding and your traffic violations . That's all. Thank you. MR. KING: I agree with that. And I am actually thrilled to see that a number of these items are being passed here to improve safety in all of these areas this evening .

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – CREATING A SIDEWALK CAFÉ AND PARKLET PROGRAM TO REPLACE THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S PREVIOUS SPECIAL ENCROACHMENT PERMIT PARKING . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-G be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SMURL: So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question . DR. ROTHCHILD : I know I voted in favor previously when this was brought during the pandemic . I'm also in favor of it tonight . This is something that it is not just relevant to our city but many other cities have taken action and allowed for local businesses or restaurants to continue having space on -- like, say on sidewalks for their businesses for outdoor dining during nicer weather . And I know it's something that I personally enjoy being able to sit outside at a number of restaurants downtown and I think it's helpful for their businesses . So I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 supportive of this continuing . Now, I didn't see a timeframe . I saw the $25 permit fee. But it just said for initiation and to apply for the permit. Am I -- was I missing that or did anyone else note a timeframe ? Is it just a annual permit fee? Does it need to be -- is there a date for it to be -- MR. KING: I believe it's annual. Perhaps we can check with the administration . DR. ROTHCHILD : That's what's I'm imagining too. But it said $25 is initiation fee. So, you know, I don't want to assume that that's what's going to continue to be the fee on an annual basis. But that's -- that's what it appears to be. MR. KING: Can we check for sure? And, you know, on the question , I'd also like to say, you know, having been to places like Media, Phoenixville , and other towns in the state across the Commonwealth , this happens all over in, you know, smaller cities, the cities like the size of Scranton . I think it really helps to make the city much more lively and brings people out and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 encourage s business , you know, in the City of Scranton . So I'll be supporting this this evening . All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-H. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING AND UPDATING THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S FIREWORKS CODE TO ALIGN WITH PENNSYLVANIA ’S AMENDED FIREWORKS LAW, ACT 74 OF 2022, TO FURTHER RESTRICT THE USE OF FIREWORKS . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-H be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I've been talking about the fireworks complaint s for years. And we frequently heard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 them here in Council and received them from resident s. And I actually felt like not enough was being done about it. So I am happy to see us tightening up our ordinance and that the state had done that through legislation last year as well. I did have some concern s about the timeframe . I did want to ask, like, what the reasoning was behind on a couple of those dates for it to be until 1 a.m. But that seems pretty late for me. And, I mean, there's a lot concerns about fireworks , you know, certainly being a nuisance to your neighbors and we're in a city. We're not in a rural area where no one is going to hear it when you set it off. But it's also like a danger to other people's properties and a danger to the people themselves setting them off. So if we could just check on the proposed hours, I'd appreciate that. But other than that, I'm happy to see this put forward . MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so I'm glad too that we actually got this legislation . I'm thinking that jumped out at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 me too. I'm thinking that the 10 a.m. to 1 a.m. the following day might be an error. It just doesn't -- I don't know -- unless it's New Year's Eve. I don't know. But someone reached out to me. There was a very nice lady named Debra Neihouse {phonetic } and a couple months back she spearhead ed the proclamation we did for women -- first women in Lackawanna . And it was a great -- she did a fantastic job. But she also reached to out me after seeing, you know, our legislation coming up. And she said instead of purchasing fireworks , why don't we challenge Scrantonians to buy some cat and dog food and donate it to the Griffen Pond Animal Shelter or any other animal shelter . So that would be putting money towards helping animals instead of harassing them and causing them horrific stress. So you know what, it's a good idea. Some people -- most people don't like fireworks from what we've heard the past couple of years here in chambers . So it was nice to get that little note from her. And I wanted to pass that on. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 there was an additional point that I wanted to add about this piece. I think it's only as good as it's enforce d. And that's a problem we've also seen in the past. So I'm glad to see on the Fourth of July weekend that there would be two officers devoted to issuing these fines and that fine is increase d. But we need to constantly be doing that just because we say it could only be during, you know, take place during these holidays 150 feet away from structures , it doesn't mean people are going to adhere to that. So if resident s do see this problem , I would encourage them to make the complaint to, like, to the nonemergency line or 311 to be able to get an officer out there at the time when it's occurring to be able to issue those fines.

SCHUSTER : Thanks. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm a big supporter of public art. And so I'm very interest ed to see what they do with this initiative .

I was interested previously and I think it's something to continue to engage with the administration on about legislation for mural projects . So that is something I would certainly like to further discuss with them. I think this will help spark that initiative . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. MR.

MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-L be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , if we could reach out to the business department just to ask for an explanation further of how they are going to do this. MR. KING: I do know this was a recommendation from Ron Kozlanski and from PFM. But if we could get further clarification , that would be great.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'd also like to know if there's precedence for this before if we've borrowed from the capital funds in advance and reimbursed ourselves because it just seems odd to me. So I would like to know if this has been done in the past. MR. SCHUSTER : And if could also throw in there if there is any type of a fee schedule that we're going to be using on Council , any type of fees associated with this type of transaction . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. On the question , so the way I read this -- I don't understand . So they want to take money from the capital fund and do some work and then take a loan to pay us back. Why is there enough money in there to do it in the first place? We're flush with ARPA money. I mean, isn't some of this could be used towards that? We're told, you know, we have some extra in this area in lost revenue we could probably use it here. But this -- just the paragraph I'm reading , I didn't read all the backup. I did some. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 But the administration is asking me or PEL or whoever else are asking me to take money from the general fund, spend it; and then approve later on a loan to pay it back. I have a real problem with this. Of course, I want the same information my colleagues just asked for. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 61, 2023 – AMENDING THE CITY’S OPEN BURN PROHIBITION TO EXPLICITLY ALLOW AN EXCEPTION FOR PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS . MR. KING: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? MR. MCANDREW : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final vote of Item 7-C. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25104 MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , as I said the last couple of weeks, I feel like this is an odd -- an odd ordinance to be passed. I didn't really like the justification that we just got recently so I'll be voting no on this. MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so last week I stated I would never burn the American flag unless it fell on the ground. I'm against burning the American flag. But I'm not against the First Amendment or protests . I just -- this is going to be a First Amendment nightmare for us down the road. It's not like people are burning the flag once a week in Scranton . So I question why the ordinance ? We get an e-mail from the solicitor saying, well, you know, it's recommended . It has nothing to do with the national firefighter 's code or international firefighter 's code. They don't refer to burning the flag. They have some open burn policies . But I'm old enough to remember women burning their bras in the 60s and 70s as a form of protest . All right?

So I think we're overstepping our bounds. I'd love to know why the big push for this. It just came out of nowhere, this ordinance . So I question that. My eyebrows raised on that. I just have an issue with this -- not against , you know, the health and safety and welfare . I get that. But Mr. Coyne made a good point. What if I wanted to do it on Sunday? Who's going to approve it for me? Or what if I want to do it -- like, how many days -- I just think we're going down a slippery slope here. And I don't want, you know, a year or two down the road litigation to come back on me in some form. At least I could say, you know what, I didn't vote for it. So that's why I'm voting no. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree with the concerns about this legislation . I think a lot of protests happen organically . They are not necessarily planned . And so for people to be consequences if they were to burn a flag or, you know, requiring a permit; it just doesn't really sit right with me either. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25106 So I'll be voting no on this.

She's on Oprah Winfrey 's team for design which is quite impressive . And she's a business owner. She's been a business owner since 2016. So I certainly respect that. And I don't think that everyone on the Planning Commission has, like, specific planning experience or degree in that. So I don't think there is anything wrong with her being on the commission , her being an appointee. I do, of course, want to make sure that we properly research under her legal name for the taxes. So that's why I'll be voting yes to grant the motion to table. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25115 MR.
