SCRANTON PARKING SYSTEM UPDATE FROM GROWAMERICA (FORMERLY NDC) RECEIVED MARCH 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 11, 2024. 3.C. CONTROLLER ’S REPORT FOR THE MONTH ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: I have a quick one. There's going to be a get-together for Gilmartin -- Detective Kyle Gilmartin this Saturday , March 23rd from 4 until 8 p.m., at the Waldorf Park up in East Mountain . There will be entertainment , basket raffles , 50/50, pasta, meatballs , salad, roll and it's 15 dollars . And obviously all the proceeds will go to Detective Gilmartin and his family so that's Saturday , the 23rd from 4 to 8 p.m. at the Waldorf . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. MR. SCHUSTER : Another announcement , the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail cleanup is going to be having a cleanup on this Saturday , March 23rd starting at South 7th Avenue in Scranton . It's going to start at 8:30 a.m. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 across the street from the Sunoco and tools will be provided . So the only thing you need to bring is some hand protection . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Okay. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Before I stay anything else, I just want to remind everybody that the Library Express in the Marketplace at Steamtown will close on April 30th. And all the items in there that are for sale are 40 percent off. So if you are looking for gifts for birthdays or even for Christmas , you could go in there and start packing that up. I checked the City's website again today. The union contracts for the firefighters and police are still not there. The contract for the firefighters , 351 days old; police is 235 days. I have to believe that the administration has no intention of getting those documents on the website . I wonder why. I'd love to see them. I also note that in the Controller 's report for February that Ufberg 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 was paid over $40,000. I assume that is for his work on dotting the I's and crossing the T's. It's been going on for a while now. You know, my next incarnation I think I'm going to come back as a labor counsel . That's where the money is. The RFP for financial forecasting , the deadline was February 29th. Has any word come down on who they might award that contract to? No? Not yet, okay. Speaking of finances , I remember when PFM was here for their presentation on the 36.2 million dollars refinancing of debt. They said by midMarch the new interest rates should be locked in. Have we had any feedback on what kind of interest rate we may be looking at for that 36.2 million dollar loan? MR. KING: Not as of today. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. We are in a good position with our bond rating so that should help. Have we had any information on the beginning of 2023 audit? That should be well under way by now? Nothing . MR. KING: The last finance meeting, yes, they discuss it. It is under way but we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 didn't get into it too much. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Also if you recall during a prior meeting when the Chief of Police was here, he mentioned that personnel staffing in the police department , operational staffing was at 80 percent . Have we had any success in increasing our staffing in the police department or are we still at 80 percent operation ally? MR. KING: That I don't know, Joan. Mark, have you heard anything from the Chief? MR. MCANDREW : The only thing I heard the last time I sat down with the Chief was, they were recruiting well. MS. HODOWANITZ : They were what? MR. MCANDREW : Recruiting well. With regards to numbers , I didn't get any at that time. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, you know, I mean, concerning , you know, the challenges that all police departments face and we've had recently , you know, the incidents of involving gangs here. It's not good to ask, you know, people to perform a mission when you don't give them the resources . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 So it's very important that we get the staffing up to par if at all if we can do that. You know, you take risks and it's not only risks to the personnel that are in the police department or the fire department , it's risks to the residents of the city. So I do hope we could get that turned around. I know recruiting is an issue nationwide and I understand that. But I want to see our people protected . And I want to see our police officers given the manpower they need to be safe. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mark Margavitch . MR. MARGAVITCH : Good evening , Council , so with the rental ordinance of 2022, Mr. Smurl, I just had a quick question . I know you didn't get to vote on it. Would have you passed that? Would you have been a yes for that ordinance on the rental -- it was one week before you were appointed . I was just wondering would you have passed that rental ordinance ? MR. SMURL: Well, I didn't read it so I'd have to look at it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MR. MARGAVITCH : Okay. Anyway, back to the rental registration . In regards , did anyone hear anything about back years prior to the '22 passing ? MR. MCANDREW : So what I could tell you is last week I inquired about it because thought I remembered something with regards to that, nothing in writing . I just kind of thought I remembered some conversation , couldn't find it in the meeting minutes . But Mr. Voldenberg researched it and so did Solicitor Gilbride . So they couldn't find anything either. MR. MARGAVITCH : Nothing yet, okay. All right. I did have my court hearing, did get a continuance . So I think the city is still trying to find the correct way to enforce that as well. So hopefully they have something . In the meantime what I did with mine is I actually opened up an escrow account where I put my rental registration money in the account until they could figure out what is going to be charged and do it equally . I'm not looking to pay anything less than I owe. But I'm certainly not going to pay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 any more on a flat fee than anyone else has to pay. Now, I would like to ask you all a question . In regards to -- we're just going to have a hypothetical . Each one of you have been elected the next Mayor. And as your first job is going to appoint the directors . So my question to you guys is if Mr. Oleski -- and I don't mean to disclude Dr. Rothchild , but Mr. Oleski if he was interested in staying in Licensing and Inspection , would any of you consider him for his current position ? I'm just curious to see where you all stand with Mr. Oleski. MR. KING: You don't have to worry about me ever becoming the Mayor so I have no comment . MR. MARGAVITCH : But just in case? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, it's a hypothetical . I'm not going to answer about -- MR. MARGAVITCH : No one is going to support for -- I'm just curious if anyone would put themselves out there. MR. MCANDREW : To be honest with you, I'm not sure where I would go with that position if I was the next Mayor. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. MARGAVITCH : Thank you for answering that. It's not a grudge I have against Mr. Oleski. But what you have to understand is when he did that to me 13 years ago and he had a very big hand in it, I had a five month old, a two year old, and a four year old at home and he shut me down. I'm sure there was never any mention of the electrical violation that they had done to me. I still never got an answer. But there really isn't one. And, you know, I think it's better for the city if we move away from these unethical people that are in leadership positions . I think it's going to relieve a big burden for the city. On a positive note, I do want to give you guys credit last week for motioning -- making a motion for the legislation for the distance around the schools . And, Mr. King, I do thank you because it's a great idea. But we also have to make sure we do it the correct way where we don't have lawsuits against the city. So we don't want to violate anyone. So that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 definitely good. And I guess my last topic would be the internal investigation that's being done. What is being -- what's the latest on that internal investigation if anyone knows of anything ? No one knows anything . MR. SMURL: It's not our investigation . I don't know. I would ask the administration . MR. MARGAVITCH : Yeah, what's interesting is, you know, I've been trying to reach them since March of '23 about my concern s about Mr. Oleski. You would think I would be maybe a point of contact for them during their investigation ; but yet, here we are. So there is also what is very concerning and a lot of the gallery and probably citizens at home don't know about and I happen to have some inside information as well as you guys up there do is the text message from one code enforcement official to another where it flat out calls Mr. Oleski's misconduct in that message . And for the life of me, I just -- it's pretty plan as day what's going on there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 And I just can't understand why we aren't taking action on this. I'm sure everyone knows up there what I'm speaking about I'm assuming , right, the text message from one code enforcement official to another ? Well, if not, I guess we'll have picture time next week. MR. SMURL: Brian Scutnick . MR. SCUTNICK : So I'll just start where Mark left off there since we want to act like we don't know anything . As far as that text goes you both got an e-mail, all of you got an e-mail twice about it from the inspector . I have it sitting back there if anybody needs a copy to refresh themselves on what you were already told by the inspector . So you do know about the texts. But if you want, I'll refresh it how it was an inspector texted someone else that a citizen got a stop work order, texted Mr. Oleski and said what do I do? Tommy referred to them a specific contractor and said, hey, just give this guy a call. The guy finished all of his work over the weekend . The contractor pulls a permit for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 him on Monday after the job's done. But no corruption there, right? So then we'll get back to the garage since we want to act like we don't know anything about that. So not last week but the week before we'll going to you, Smurl, since you wanted to deny it. Original ly you said you don't know about the garage. And there was picture s that said, hey, there's your truck in the garage, right? And then the week after every time it was brought up you tried to say, well, it's not his garage. Sound about right? MR. SMURL: I didn't say it wasn't his garage. I said it wasn't -- I don't believe it was his business . MR. SCUTNICK : Okay. So then we'll go by the city ordinance of it, right. The city ordinance says though if there is no owner, there is no business license , where do the fines revert to? Where do they revert? MR. SMURL: Let me know. MR. SCUTNICK : They revert back to the homeowner . MR. SMURL: Well, there you go.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. SCUTNICK : So it goes to the property owner, right, that's the city ordinance . We could go and we can shut down I think his name was David Etzel. We could shut down his garage and bury him in fines for the exact same business but we're not going to shut down the one that the code enforcement director has at his own house. MR. SMURL: Did you say David Etzel was shut down by the city? MR. SCUTNICK : It was that -- he came here and spoke his garage was shut down and he was buried in like $10,000 in fines. MR. SMURL: Oh, okay. MR. SCUTNICK : And then he went to Central Court, everything got out of it I know. He came here and spoke a couple weeks ago to you guys. I'm sure you remember . It was over Minooka . So Tom Oleski will go shut down his business but it's okay for him to run the same business . Does that make any sense to you? MR. SMURL: Well, I don't know if he was shut down by the city. MR. SCUTNICK : He was shut down by the city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. SMURL: Well, I'd have to check that to be fact. MR. SCUTNICK : He had all the paperwork . You guys didn't want to see it. It's also right to know information . Obviously the city is going to say they don't know where it is. They can't find it. When the state calls them out and says you're a liar. Stop lying on sworn statements . They're going to say, oh, well, we miraculously found it because that's what your right to know officer does. The business at Oleski's house for starters , I reached out to somebody I knew that's a criminal investigator over at the IRS so they could open a complaint on it. Miraculously , there's no EIN number that says he has a business . So what's that? It's okay for the director to have five years of tax evasion ? Does that sound at all appropriate ? MR. SMURL: If you're claiming it's his business . I don't know. MR. SCUTNICK : It's his property . Look up the deed. Do you need a copy of that? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Do I have to do your job for you? Like, what are you appointed for? You can't look at a deed. MR. SMURL: I'm appoint ed for legislation , not to judge -- MR. SCUTNICK : Then make legislation that says if you are a public or city official you have to be honest. Like, is that a legislation we need? Don't be corrupt . We have to put a rule out there? We didn't learn anything from Bill Courtright? But he was under Bill Courtright 's administration . Why didn't we get rid of him? I mean, if there's a garage at his house going on that's an illegal business , possible tax evasion realistic ally it would fall as constructive possession . Your attorney can vouch for that. He knows about the business . He has a willing ness to allow the business . Do you know what I mean? It's just like the race car sponsors that we have contract s with in the city. Does that make any sense? No? So it's just nothing is making sense here. Nobody wants to answer for it. And you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 could make legislation like we really need rules that says you have to not lie to the citizens . Or you have to pass a background check isn't one of them. Did we look at the situation from last week? It's okay to use a city car to pick up beer kegs at the U? We need legislation for that? No? Anybody ? Does anybody speak? It's like crickets up there, right? You don't see a problem with that? Does anybody see a problem with that? That's a question ? Do I -- no? MR. MCANDREW : I don't know if it's part of the investigation , so I really don't want to respond . MR. SCUTNICK : You want to know where it is, I'll tell you. MR. MCANDREW : No, I don't want to respond to it if some of this is part of the investigation . MR. SCUTNICK : So I'll let you know where your investigation 's at by the city. Your city hired an investigator . The first one decided to turn around and said I can't do it because I'm already suing on behalf of a citizen . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 So they hired a second one that's miraculously using the office of the person that represents the city to do his meeting s. But he doesn't show up to the meeting against where the investigation started . So the person that wrote the seven-page letter telling you what's going on, your attorney doing the investigation didn't show up for his own meeting . So, I mean, is it really a bias investigation if he's not going to show up where the people are going to talk? I mean, he sounds like he should just have a job at city administration if he's not going to talk to the citizens . MR. SMURL: Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . Last week I came down to register my rental property , which I live at. And I said to the woman, I don't have to pay, right, because I live there. She said, no, you also have to have a relative live on the other side, which my daughter does. But I disagreed with that. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 way I read it is I'm the only one that has to live there. I don't have to let somebody else have to live there. Do you know which way it is? MR. SMURL: Les, I believe as a family member, you don't pay a rental registration fee. MR. SPINDLER : She said I have to live there plus a family member on the other side. That's not the way I read the ordinance . So am I right or is she right? You people pass the ordinance . So how does it read? MR. SCHUSTER : The answer that you got was that the renter that's renting your property also has to be a relative. MR. SPINDLER : Yeah. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. I do know you have to the register the property . Although -- MR. SPINDLER : Oh, yeah, I register ed it. But as long as I live there, that's -- I'm the only one that has to live there to not have to pay. MR. SCHUSTER : We'll find out. MR. SPINDLER : She said, no, you have to have a relative on the other side also. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 It's not the way I read the ordinance . I don't know if I'm reading it wrong so -- MR. SCHUSTER : We'll get an answer for you on that one. MR. SPINDLER : You could bring up the ordinance on your computer right now. Moving on, last Friday I was driving over Lackawanna Avenue. I was at the traffic light at Adams and Lackawanna . And I looked just past there's the first building there. It used to be a Hazzouri 's Dental. I don't know if it is anymore . There's a high wall just passed there and really never took notice. That wall is a disgrace . It's filthy dirty. There's cracks in it. I know Streetscape is suppose d to do something on that block. They're suppose d to fix the wall that's by the Radison . Do you know if they are going to do anything with that other wall? It either has to be painted over or maybe we can get somebody to get -- put a mural there. It's an eyesore . It's terrible looking . I don't know if you're all familiar with it. It's really ugly. MR. SMURL: Les, Lackawanna Avenue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 side or is it the Adams Avenue side? MR. SPINDLER : It's on the side of the Radison . MR. SMURL: Lackawanna Ave., okay. MR. SPINDLER : Next thing, last time I was here I talked about the Times-Tribune . There is nothing in the paper anymore. So I'm a sports fan. You open the sports section , all there is is high school sports, no professional sports, no scores. So I have been a subscriber for years and years and years. I'm seriously thinking of dropping my subscription . I think this is a perfect time for somebody to open up a new newspaper in the city because I think people would jump on board and leave the Times-Tribune there because there is nothing in the paper anymore. With a 7:30 deadline , there's no sports. As I said it's just high school. And I'm not a high school fan. I like college and pros. And there's no news after 7:30. I don't know if any of you get the paper, but it's like half the size it used to be. So it's a perfect time for somebody to start a new newspaper. As 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 I said, I would definitely jump on board. Lastly, people come to this podium and bash President Biden, said he's not of sound mind. Well, if they watched the State of the Union address , I thought he was pretty good. He showed me that he's really of sound mind and he did a heck of a job. And he really gave it to the Republicans that night. I think he's of very sound mind. That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thanks. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: I'm sorry, I thought I was under Lee. Well, sorrowfully and embarrassed again I admit I often plagiarize comments from others because they don't want the stigma of coming down here and having harsh words about anything . And besides that, almost everybody is mad at me anyway. But the other day at Quinn's Market I ran into two or three allies finally that come to the conclusion like me about this $300,000 low income property of Cockwell {phonetic } and Ace. According to their own guidelines , it's a complete impossibility for any low income family to rent it, pay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 utilities and rent. All the expense like insurance and so on will be skyrocketing for a $300,000 property . It seems like where this is heading is for the taxpayers of the city and county to have to subsidize this whole deal. And that comes from some intelligent people in the real estate circles . That's all we need. You people must stop this from happening to the taxpayers here in the county. There is no other way they could rent this place. For 300,000, they could have had five or six homes upgraded, single-family homes around town that are on the tax list and so forth. This was just nothing but a monumental waste for God's sake. I think Mr. Cockwell and Ace have taken advantage of a bunch of gullible naive contributors . That's why nobody likes me for statements like that, you know. And then the Mayor made a statement that we need more housing like this. We don't. We don't need low income housing in the city. Low income housing brings undesirable people. Look what has happened to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 my neighborhood at North Main. It's -- it is probably half -- property probably worth half of what it was when I bought my house. It's just -- it's just -- last Tuesday night when I left here, there was nine cars completely on the sidewalk from Market Street to my house. These are your children in the street because of illegal cars in front of illegal boarding houses and nothing 's done. We have a code enforcement that is completely useless . Last week they sent me a letter, the second one, my door is being blocked by some things. It's not a door. It's a window. If the lady had gotten out of her car and just moved a few feet, she could see it's a window. There's no doorknob or nothing . Inside the house when I bought it, it's sheet rocked with a window. That's the kind of code enforcement people that they get. You know, for 20 years I guess I've been coming down here. Nobody ever listens . I hear such good suggestion and comments from people. It just doesn't go nowhere . I think it's time the City of Scranton taxpayers start really thinking serious about a new Mayor. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 We need somebody that has lived and worked in this town in the past 5 or 10 years that knows the town and the neighborhoods and the people, not someone from 3,000 miles away. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is I'd like to give the residents of the city my phone number. It's 570-604-1212. And I'd appreciate anybody in this city who's had a problem with licensing and inspections to either send me a text or call me. I really think we have to find a solution to the problems we have. I don't think the Council is capable . I missed last week's meeting because I met with the Republicans over here in lower South Side, I guess trying to stand up a city Republican party maybe to run in an election because we definitely need a change in this city. You know, I just find that what's going on here is complete ly wrong. You know, Mr. Smurl, I don't know why the Mayor appoint ed you to Council . In my own opinion and it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 only my own, I think you did the Mayor a favor by taking down the slide and she knew there was going to be a vacancy on the Council and she appoint ed you to it. That's my opinion . I'm entitled to. But your indifference to the suffering of the resident s of this city -- all five Council members talking that your legislators, we've gone through that already . The Home Rule Charter gives you a right to do investigation s. You shirk your duty to the taxpayer and the residents of the city. And, you know, when you -- you can take all the money you want to and you could invest in low income housing and nobody is against people being poor because a lot of us were poor when we were children . But, you know, you have to face the reality . The city's population base has dropped from 140,000 down to 75. You have a speaker come and talk about the Scranton Times. They sold that newspaper before it collapsed . You know, we just have the most corrupt public official s you could ever imagine . And I find you to be corrupt .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 And I've given the definition of corruption from this podium. And I think the people should look it up. And, you know, when you have a person running Licensing and Inspections who runs an illegal business on his property and then somebody says, well, it's son's business , I don't care whose business it is. And, you know, when you walked around and you blame property owners who rent property and then you try to make it sound like they're dragging the city down. That's not the problem . The problem is the city itself. Its leaders . It's been that way a long time. I think if you have a problem with people that have rental property , you need to go to your State Rep or State Senator and ask how somebody could live in a property for three months or four months and not pay you and smash every bit of it up and then leave and you never get your money, never. And you never get the damages either. And then, of course, you've got a city that's unwilling to invest in itself. And last week you were talking about taking interest off 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 of the recovery -- the President Biden's great plan he has for everybody and diverting that interest money somewhere . Look it, you could vote for President Biden if you want to. But he doesn't even know where he is. And when you listen to the hearing s taking place in Washington about the fiasco, the pull out of Afghanistan , you have to ask yourself why we lost all of those people in those wars. We haven't won a war since -- we didn't even win Korea. We have our blood all over the world and we have nothing to show for it. And we all walk around on -- and celebrate -- I don't know what we're celebrating . We haven't won a war since World War II but we've killed a lot of our citizen s. And when we look at the our country and we have to look at the people we elect, I'm just wondering have any of you ever read the Constitution or the Bill of Rights? Do you have any idea really what you should be doing for the people here in this city, just any idea any -- just the wildest idea you might have because talking to a stone wall that's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 educated -- and I'm not interested if you have a PhD or not because that doesn't mean you're intelligent or educated . That just means you could learn curriculum and pass a test, okay, but do you have raw intelligence ? I mean, look at what's going on in the city. You can't even answer a question . You can't do an investigation . You have 30 -- over 30 people who had their properties condemned by inspectors that aren't certified . You don't even care. You have inspectors walking around putting condemned stickers on buildings . They don't even know what they're doing. You're destroying your own city. It's just a sham. MR. SMURL: Next, Joe Beadle -- B-E-- UNIDENTIFIED MAN: -- he's not here and the next one too. MR. SMURL: The next one too. All right. All right. That's it for the sign-in list. Anyone else that would like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Good evening , first, I want to address the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 funding of the capital reserve. That's great. But at the same time you're leaving the pension fund underfunded. I get wanting a safety net, but I also get the intentional avoidance of properly funding the pensions because as long as you avoid fixing it, you could charge three times the LTS, the local service tax from $52 to $156 a year. As far as I'm concerned , the intentional underfunding falls just short of racketeering . Making a massive rainy day fund at the time you don't fulfill your obligations so you could grab an extra $104 a year in taxes is shameful . We have many failures on Council . Mr. King last year promised legislation from this body on tax relief for the flood victims . He assured us it was no rush because we had a lot of time before the tax bills would be generated . Council assured people Council would be the vanguard and then they hid in the back row. Let's do nothing as our inaction will help Pickleball Paige get reelected . Then we had two issues of violence outside and inside 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 the Veteran 's Memorial Stadium . But we don't want to address that issue because it puts the city and the school board in a bad light. So we moved onto contract for gang violence . Then a parole because someone had a car stolen that they left unlocked out front of their home in Green Ridge. We had a youth picked up for a weapon outside of the school. But we have no juvenile lockups because this area was caught in a kids for cash deal. Then we moved onto Officer Gilmartin who was shot in an unmarked car during a stakeout, all hard issues to deal with. So how did we? Prayers and public donations . Now we have a new thing to kick, the homeless . That's okay. They tend not to fight back. Two weeks ago I was disturbed when Mr. Little explained how the homeless have to get paperwork to verify their homeless . Last week we saw a man who used to be somewhat coherent but he tended to ramble while trying to get some help. Last week he stood here for two minutes trying to focus on a single 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 thought . He said he should have known fighting in court was a losing battle but it was his only option. He stood broken. No one helped. No one cared. But that's the Christian thing to do to the unclean . We suddenly have a homeless advisory committee , but we have no idea where and when the meetings are and who's on it. Since it seems it's a decision making body, it should be under the Sunshine Law or is it just words to look good. I guess we need more inaction and another study. I believe Jesus said these words, ship them out, not in my backyard . Oh, or was that someone else who decided it was easier to use the law to wash his hands of the matter. Last, we have a group of another nonprofit who came in who wants to take free land from the Land Bank and make it nontaxable to help the homeless . Why would they do that? Because there's a lot of money in funding in sheltering the homeless . Why is the city not using the land or securing the land for homeless building the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 equivalent of a hotel of tiny structures . How good would it look for the city to employ its own people and shelter its homeless , not just for eight hours a day and then collect a lot of the federal grants and Section Eight to pay for that. I'm not talking about under the Housing Authority but under the city itself. And heaven forbid we build a useful long-term asset for the city. Put it near a water source pumping the water for great water. I know you need to use the water company for more than drinking . And once upon a time cities had public bathhouses, no more. Now only leachate and the water company could pollute our waters. There's so much to do but we were served a lot nothing , a lack of inspiration , short-sighted actions . It's disgusting . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . It was announced we have a triple B city finance rating. And, you know, I will remind everybody that when you get elected to an office, you have a legacy that you have to cover. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 And some of them are well thought out laws and regulations and some are not so good. And a low income person was trying to get a low income housing or something . And when North Scranton was renovated , it was disclose d that had each apartment was $414,000. How many small homes could that have built is my question or much more reasonable situations as that went on for years. And part of the reason, I heard a business or commercial property bubble when Obama was walking into office after the crash that started in 2007 continued into 2008. One of our Council members was a democrat in name only. And he tried to oppose the recession at that time. That's starting in 2009. Well, it didn't start in 2009. And he was out front destroying the credibility of the taxpayers with a protest against Paul Kanjorski showing up as our guest. You don't invite somebody and harass them. Now, driving in the city it was about two weeks ago I was at the Spruce Street and Adams. So that goes west. Three cars ran a red light, I mean, straight ran the red 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 light. They were at the middle of the block and blew through there. And then some runners -- little twinkle toes around town here, they ran out when the right hand turned green. Now, I could have turned way before that and tried to slip it in. Well, tonight I was sitting there and as usual, the right-hand turn was red. And when I looked to see and it turned green, I had a policeman right behind me. So how would that have worked out for me, you know? And on guns, I've always advocated that parents keep guns very secure. The Crumbleys here -- and I think it was in Illinois . They bought their kid a gun and they were supervising its use but left it laying around. He went to school and shot a couple of kids. And they have both been convicted of involuntary manslaughter . So they are probably going to wind up with a couple years in prison. And guess what, I don't care. They deserve it. And rag on the flag, my favorite subject . You know, we come in here and rag about the flag. Well, here is an article from Dan Meuser. And we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 were ragging about the flag and voting for people like this. Additional aid to Ukraine needs accountability and oversight . I mean, you think those people over in Ukraine were shooting their riffles in the air and yelling (inaudible ) and complaining that they are out ammunition . You know, so if Ukraine collapses -- and it has to with here because I hear it constantly we're ragging about the flag. We wouldn't put that flag up. Well, that very person -- one of them, the person that bought it I am sure is not a supporter of any idea to ship Ukraine aid. And time and time again I've had to hear the ragging on the flag. It's just ridiculous . So, please, if you're going to rag about the flag, why don't you support the cause that -- in writing in votes. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. LABROSKY : Good evening , Council , Lynn Labrosky , city resident , homeowner , business owner. So I got up here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 last week and I talked about a couple different things. The first thing I wanted to mention tonight was that I complained about going block to block and not being able to drive one block in the city without finding garbage or code violations and how bad the city was starting to look with all the trash that's collecting around the city and it's everywhere . So I happened to see online that they were doing a spruce up the city cleanup on Saturday from 11 to 1 over in Tripp Park. So I felt like, well, if I got up there and talked about it, I should probably be about it. And my husband and I showed up Saturday morning to volunteer to help clean up the trash in that section of the city. It was a great concept . We got a lot done that day. I was very disappoint ed to not see the Mayor there. I was hoping to have a conversation . I guess she wasn't able to attend that. So a couple of people from her office were there. I believe their names were Isaiah and Channel . So I was able to give them a few suggestion s if going forward with another cleanup. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 So I believe we collected well over 40 bags of trash in an hour and a half. And they talked about doing another cleanup in May, which is a pretty long way off from March. I mean, we could do a trash pickup every week for the rest of the summer and probably maybe still not pick up all the garbage in the city. The bags weren't the sturdiest bags. They were makeshift contract or bags. But they were busting and ripping . So maybe going forward we could get something a little better for that. And we did come across quite a few hypodermic needles. So maybe a Sharps container would be a great idea for the next cleanup. Also, I don't think it was advertised in the newspaper until Friday and the cleanup was on Saturday . So that wouldn't have given anyone a lot of time with planning their weekend to maybe volunteer for that. You know, I did ask the two assistant s that were there from the Mayor's office if they had reached out to maybe any of the high school kids, college kids, a lot of them need community credits to graduate , just a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 thought , just an idea. But the people that did show up aside from my husband and myself were two women from the Aaron Center, a guy from NeighborWorks and he brought his young daughter to help. And I would say other than the couple of people from the Mayor's office, half of the crew was the Recovery Bank. And there was a photographer that showed up to take some photos. These people worked really hard. They collected almost 50 bags of trash, big contractor size bags in just one section of a neighborhood which happened to be the Mayor's street, but okay. But anyway, so we did actually want to see where she lived because I've never got gone up that far. And we found her walking right about the time we were done collecting garbage . She had a little Gerrity bag and she had an excuse for not being there. But we did exchange business cards. I invited her to come visit our business , told her we had some other things we would like to talk to her about. She has not reached out. There's no contact . But again, the garbage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 cleanup was a great thing. We could have picked up a lot more garbage because it was 11 to 1, but we ran out of bags. So that was unfortunate . And also, I noticed that the people that were volunteering , they got a little thirsty and hungry and there was nothing to provide for the people that were working for free. You know, so I know these people maybe aren't up to her photo opportunity , but I also know that, you know, they worked really hard and they're trying to stay clean. So maybe a little, you know, recognition would give them what they need to stay sober or whatever they have to do in their lives instead of being made to feel like maybe they're not worth the photo op. So I did talk to someone from the newspaper today. And we'll see if they put it in the paper. But it was a good idea. I think we need a lot more of them. And if we could just get the word out more and maybe get more people involved . There was no DPW truck. They had us unload 50 bags of trash onto the curb and then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 back into my husband 's truck because it had to go to a dumpster . But we were told where the spot was to leave the trash. So it was just a lot of extra work. They wanted you to go seven blocks or eight blocks and pick up trash and then carry that big heavy bag back to a designated spot. So, like I said, my husband offered his truck. And he went around and picked up all of those bags and we filled a pickup truck. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. LABROSKY : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . I would like to report on what's happening to the Lookout. I reported it before and it got a little bit of work by somebody . I don't know who. But it is terrible . I mean, every morning I go down that, you know, 307 and there's more rocks have been knocked out and more paint. And I don't know why -- I mean, that's something special . Maybe all of you are too young to remember World War II and what the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 people came out and did for volunteering . But we need to do something . I mean, get -- I assume there's police out at night. If they drove by every once in a while it might make a difference or put a camera up there to see who's doing all of that damage. But I don't know if they ever got anybody out there to look at what had happened . But now it's really, really a mess. So, okay, so onto another thing. Are you people satisfied with the -- that we are getting our money's worth from our lobbyist ? Okay, Mark, you're not. MR. MCANDREW : I voted no for that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Anybody ? Anybody up there happy enough with their lobbyist ? MR. KING: I think they're doing a good job. MS. SCHUMACHER : Do we get a regular report? MR. KING: We do. I think we one not too long ago. MR. SCHUSTER : We gave one last week. MR. KING: Last week. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. If you guys are satisfied , I guess that's what we have to put up with. Now, stormwater , that's something we talk about a lot. And I don't know what they're doing to handle the stormwater from I guess a square block that the University of Scranton is putting a building on. That was all grass and it was, you know, it sucked up the water, all the stormwater . But do you know how they are treating the stormwater when -- in the building ? MR. SMURL: Well, before construction , they are codes they have to go by so -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon? MR. SMURL: There are codes and rules they have to go by like anyone else. The University has to go by the same rules. So they will do it properly . On Jefferson and Mulberry ; is that what you're talking about? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, we've had other people who have done things under the same rules we have now and they have not done 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 anything to maintain -- they had not had any plans to keep the extra water that was -- would have gone into our system and get it out after. And the rules were the same. That's why I would like to have you guys look into what they're doing -- going to do with that stormwater and report it back to us. But if you don't want to that, maybe there is some other ways. I don't know. MR. SMURL: Well, as soon as they pull a permit then they'll have to start doing it the way it's supposed to be done. But they need to pull a permit first to start construction . MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, that's got to be in the design. I don't know. MR. SMURL: I certainly hope it is. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Does anybody know what -- what's happened to the Wawa that was suppose d to be built on Moosic Street? MR. SMURL: I haven't heard anything . MR. KING: I haven't had an update. I mean, I believe the project is schedule d to move forward . Maybe we could try to get some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 type of update on that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MS. SCHUMACHER : I hope so. Okay. I guess I'll quit until next week. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , could we also put the Lookout on the list, see if there's anything that we would do up there? I know when Marie brought it up last year some work was done. MR. VOLDENBERG : They did do a cleanup. But I'll ask about the wall that's deteriorating . MR. KING: Also, if DPW, like, if there's any way they could bring, like, some type of compressor so that they could power wash, you know, any graffiti that might be up there, I would appreciate anything they could do to help keep that area clean. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll mention that, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. DENNEBAUM : Hi. Mark Dennebaum , I'm a resident . I wasn't going to come up and speak. But I believe her name is Lynn kind of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 inspired me. So I just want to let everybody know that Saturday at 8:30 on Railroad Avenue at the Sunoco across from the Heritage Trail, that's where the location is. We're going to clean up the Heritage Trail at 8:30 in the morning . So anybody is interested , anybody in this room that wants to go, we greatly appreciate it. It's a whole bunch of us are going to be there. So I just want to let everybody know. I'm not coming up to criticize anybody . I was just saying if you guys want to come down, love to see you Saturday . MR. SCHUSTER : I did announce that at the beginning of the meeting . MR. DENNEBAUM : Oh, did you? I came in late because , you know, I'm never on time. Thanks. MR. MCANDREW : Thanks. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Mr. Smurl, first and foremost , I'd like to have a discussion with you. Over the duration of the last two weeks I asked about the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority and the Scranton Parking Authority . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 I mentioned it. However , you didn't make a mention of it from your chair to anybody else. You know, this is a very important issue and just not to me but to the taxpayers and the citizen s of the City of Scranton . It's a huge shadow that's hanging over our head. And to be frank with you, I think those that sat in your like you Bob McGoff would be very disappoint ed. Every time you swing that gavel and it hits that piece of wood, you're making a decision , okay. We made a decision about Nay Aug and the pool complex . We're taking two pools, we're turning them sideways , shortening the complex to half of its size and it's going to be a new complex . Less than 50 feet away there's going to be people playing wiffle tennis yelling pickle. All right. Since we already know about gang activity , what do you think that pool complex is actually going to look like? MR. SMURL: I have picture s I could send to you. MR. MANCINI : Well, no, I'm just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 saying. In all fairness , there's going to be a bunch of people there. We have gang activity since 2008. It was a poor decision , okay. That being said, when we make poor decisions and we hire people from out of the area for administrative duties, head of different departments who have lack of judgement from not being here, this is the end result. Okay, I want to talk to you tonight about a few things. After my son's passing I started a Neviah project on his birthday this past November of 20th. Two of you that were present were at a town hall meeting about awareness , education , prevention to the area. I'm going to expand that to include poor decisions . In the next month I'm going to be having another town hall meeting . As long as you're present , you make the right decisions , you're welcome to attend that. It will be open to the public. And I think with poor choices with our younger people, end up with poor results . We've seen that quite a bit lately. Let me change the subject to our roads. You know, this is one of the very last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 pieces of importance that we have left, one of our last remaining assets. Recently I watched one of our DPW department employees filling the roads in. You know, they're hard workers . They truly are. However , you know, they're also smart. And, you know, I think that when they go to fill these roads, these potholes and there's tons of them all over because of poor maintenance , poor decisions , somebody from not even being from here takes a straight shot up to Waverly . Call it what you want. A lot of people say the same thing. So what we want to do is we want to take a different look at our roads, all right. Every time a utility company goes to make a cut they back up a truck, call it a day. We have ordinances in place for the maintenance of these roads. I think that should include utility cuts to include the hot box that we've been discussing . They start at about 28,000 a year. All right. Every time they go to make a utility cut, they should fill it the proper way. We should also make these manhole cover 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 utilities responsible as well for the manhole covers. You have these ordinances in place and force them -- force a letter to the utilities , have them correct the issue. Also look at DPW as far as getting the right equipment to do this work. Now, those employees , they didn't blow out the hole. They just put the pavement in, pavement rake, that was in. They didn't pack it down. Six months from now that hole is going to come back. That's why we see these because time management, not doing the job effectively , that becomes the end result. Thanks Pothole Paige. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a couple comments . We mention ed the Lookout. Can we get an update on the tax relief for the flood victims? I know that they were all identified and letters have gone out to all of them. I don't know, Attorney Gilbride , if you have any updates on that? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 ATTY. GILBRIDE : The county was leading that charge on that. The names were provided by the city to the county of city resident s that were impacted. The county is taking the lead because it goes to the assessment office. And, therefore , they have to -- the county has to help them through that process . MR. KING: All right. Thank you. I was hoping to get to that cleanup on Saturday . My daughter is involve d with the Scranton High Basketball Team, not as a player. She's the manager of the girl's team. I was Easton. So I'm going to try to make every opportunity and try to get down there Saturday over on -- I guess the -- I can't think of the name of the street where the Sunoco is -- is that Seventh Avenue -- Railroad , Railroad , right. So I believe that starts at 8 a.m. -- 8:30. Thank you very much. And then thank you to any citizen who is willing to get out and help clean up. This is always kind of like a right of spring. And there's no doubt that, you know, we all play a part in trying to keep our city clean. So I appreciate everyone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 who is willing to volunteer to help pick up the trash in our city. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, a few. Mr. King just talked about the tax relief piece. And Mr. Gilbride followed up with it. That's going to go through the county. So those properties were identified and letters have gone out and they are going appeal that through the county for that relief. Anything else we feel has to anybody there in, Mr. Gilbride , because I think it wasn't clear maybe to the audience that anything had -- anything was occurring for those properties . ATTY. GILBRIDE : No. The process is underway. The county has started . They've been -- they've been -- the individuals have been reached out to. And I know the information was provided by the city to the county and now it's in the county's hands to follow through the process of the assessment . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Next, it was brought up in public comment tonight about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 our refinancing that's going to come up. Mr. Voldenberg , if we could reach out to see if we did get an interest rate locked in or if we're still in the process of that rate? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find out, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. We didn't have an update on Ferdinand Street as far as I know, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : Not received as of today. I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. One other thing, recently there was an article in the paper about the fire station on Ash Street. We haven't gotten any -- too much information about that building . Can we reach out to the administration and see if we've had the building appraise , if it was something -- I know it was discussed possible sale of that building ; but if there plans for sale, if the building has been appraise d and what the next steps are with that building . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That's all, Mr. Smurl. Oh, sorry, one thing. Miss Schumacher , I did report out last week but I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 do it again. So we did get -- I have Councilman Schuster asked if Council may get an update regarding Nossaman , LLP, for services to the city and their project performed since the last time we got a report. So they did -- there was eight activities that they did. One was EV chargers and the LCCC program . The second one was a recompete grant. The third one was a hydrogen hub possibility for Scranton . The fourth one was addressing the 243 million plus at SAAP. The fifth was abandoned mine issues. The sixth was EPA, EPA WC 200 million for Pennsylvania drinking water improvements . The seventh was the Amtrak line to Scranton and the eighth was the SAAP. So they were the actions that they -- that Nossaman had completed for the city since our last report. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : You're welcome . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I got a few. First of all, thank you, Lynn and husband . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 apologize , I know his first name for participating in the first city cleanup and reporting out some very good information related to it so we could do it better. We need better bags. It wouldn't hurt to provide some bottled water and maybe something to eat. So thank you for bringing them concerns to us. Keep up the good work -- I'm sorry, what? Oh, definitely Sharp -- that's very concerning . That was a great idea. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Inaudible .) Right across the street from West Side High School. MS. LABROSKY : (Inaudible .) MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Great. Second, so it's been brought to my attention that the City of Scranton Police Department doesn't have any active shooter training or any firearms training associated with that for their police officers . I also do know that police officers have to qualify annually at the range. But, you know, we all know that we now live in a not if by when climate and must provide our brave 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 police officers with every available resource . So this training , if needed, I'm, you know, this is an inquiry . I'm just hearing this. Maybe we have some of it, maybe we don't, maybe not everybody 's had some training . But, of course, this training can be achieved at the Serrenti Center which is suppose d to be our training center. So, Mr. Voldenberg , would you please forward these concern s to the police chief as an inquiry ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. So I've also been told by some resident s that there's some type of garage slash repair shop that operates next door to REO Sales on Keyser Avenue. And it's not part of REO. I have pics, Mr. Voldenberg , that I will send to you. It looks very unsafe and definitely not up to any type of code that they would have to be in compliance with. So, Mr. Voldenberg , would you please contact code enforcement and have them check this place out? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : The pictures that I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 received is pretty scary. So I'll send -- I'll forward them to you tomorrow . Remind me, please. And also, on Scranton Street in West Scranton , it's on the side of the post office. There's been a car there. It's the fourth week now. All right. It's a blue car. I have picture s I'm going to send you of that. So it's an abandon ed vehicle . It's, first of all, very -- too close to the stop sign, which is one violation . It has no current inspection which is another . And it has a flat tire. So could you please have the police, you know, take a look at that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll ask that it be removed . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Also, a resident pointed out to me last week and I had the opportunity to drive by and take a look. On 12th and Hampton Street in West Scranton -- and it's on the top of -- we call it over there West Side Hill. So if you were to pass the high school and go up West Side Hill on the right is the baseball field where they practice . And up at the top to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 there's a hole. And I don't know if it's -- it's a huge hole. It's a very, very concerning public safety issue. I don't know why the hole is there. But first of all, it shouldn 't be and it's very dangerous . So there's some little plastic fencing around it. But it's -- I don't know if it's the responsibility of the water company . I don't know if it's the resident did something or, you know, DPW has -- it's a project in the making or their working through , but very concern ing public safety issue if you could please have -- alert all three and see who is responsible for taking care of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : I also have picture s of that I'd happy to send you. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Last week Mrs. Schumacher asked about the building on Lackawanna and Wyoming Avenue and the outside of it. It looked like it was being worked on for a long time. And to follow up, this is the operation field supervisor updated and he said, Pioneer Construction is pouring 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 concrete in the basement areas this week. It should be complete d by the end of this week. And then as soon as the restoration for the outside , Stafursky Paving will put it on their schedule weather providing -- good weather and then they will do it. And they'll repair that as needed. The other one, 614 Willow Street, quality of life issues or citations were issued for appliances , garbage and pallets and stuff in the yard. And one more thing, Mr. Mancini, I do have updated pictures of the pools of the new -- of the construction of the pools. They are in the same direction . There are two of them. And there is also a splash pad. And it does take up the entire area that the original pools were in. But if you get your e-mail address for me, I'll get you those plans and I'll send them to you. You asked me about the pool. And that is all I have, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. KING: Mr. President , also if I could just add, can you reach out to the administration and just get an update on the 2023 audit just to see how that's progressing ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 I remember last year we got held up by the Sewer Authority . I just would like to try to make sure that doesn't happen again this year. MR. VOLDENBERG : We were advised it is in process . But I'll get more specifics . MR. KING: Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me. I do remember the new auditor coming and speaking to us saying, you know, we're going provide updates for you, not like the last auditor . So maybe it's time. It is time. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. 5-B.
