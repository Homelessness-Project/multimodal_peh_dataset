CORRESPONDENCE DATED JANUARY 31, 2023 FROM OECD REGARDING CODE ENFORCEMENT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 REPORT FOR CITY COUNCIL . 3.B. OPENGOV REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY 2023 FOR LICENSES AND PERMITS RECEIVED FROM THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT . 3.C. CUMULATIVE LICENSES /PERMITS REPORT AS RECEIVED FROM THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR 2023. MR. MCANDREW : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SMURL: I have one just one. Nay Aug Park's Annual Food Drive is this Saturday and Sunday the 11th and the 12th from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. All nonperishable foods or cash donation s are accepted . Everything they collect is divided up and distributed into all the other food banks. If you -- volunteers will be there tomorrow to help you unload if you have like a whole truckload . And Norma will be there to help you too. Enter on the on-street side. And it's the community room right on the right side. That's it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a couple. So February is Black History Month. And on Saturday , the City held the flag raising for the Pan-African flag. There is also a celebration with Black Scranton at their space up in North Scranton , which I was able to attend which was a really great event. But they do have other events for the month so you could check out their website at Black Scranton .org. And a couple things they'll have, they'll have a few nights where they're showing films at their center. Sunday, February 9, there is becoming Frederick Douglas that will be shown. And then Sunday, February 26th, Jim Crow of the North is another one and also Thursday , February 17th at 7 p.m., will be a live broadcast. And that will also be at their center which is at 1902 North Main Avenue. Like I said, a lot of that information could be found on their website . I'd encourage people to attend their events if they're interested in celebrating Black History Month. And just another event that I wanted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 to mention , I don't know if you've seen in the news. I think it's been on the news as well as in the newspaper that over at the Garden of Cedar they are taking hearts and putting them throughout the garden. It's really a great way to get people over to the garden before they start planting come spring. And they're having an open house this weekend Saturday from two to four at the Garden of Cedar which is on Cedar Avenue in South Side. That's all. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? I just have a quick one. So I'm happy to announce after, you know, quite a bit of concerns about lifeguards over at Weston Field that Scranton Parks and Rec have posted -- utilize d on social media that they're certified in hiring lifeguard s. And you could actually register either through social media or at the City's website . And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. MCANDREW : First up, Joan Hodowanitz . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Do we have an update on the audit? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing since last week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, this morning I went to the bid opening for the next series of audits. It was an interesting experience . I had to basically fight my way into City Hall for a public meeting . Now, I didn't call ahead until I got here because my opinion if there's a public meeting scheduled during business hours, the public should be able to get entry into the building . Well, I finally got in and it turns out there was only one bid made. It was by Clifford Lawson and Allen out of Pittsburgh . And they're going to be charging twice of what Kohanski charged . But that's neither here nor there. And speaking of Kohanski , I will remind you of what is in the contract when they put out the RFP. The City also expects the firm to dedicate sufficient resources to the completion of the work on a timely basis. If the audit is not completed by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 September 30th of the subsequent fiscal year, the City of Scranton may assess a 10 percent annual cost penalty on the contractual costs of the audit for the fiscal year in question . If minimally a draft audit is not delivered by September 30th completion date. Now, Kohanski is doing its fourth audit. And every year it's been late. Although I think this year they are going for a record, the latest audit in the history of Scranton . But that's neither here nor there. I would ask -- I hope that Mr. King can hear me because I just see a little yellow light there. If he meets with the Mayor as he does I understand on a weekly basis, please ask her if she is going to direct her Law Department to assess this fine. If not, why not? It's taxpayer dollars paying Kohanski . And this is not Monopoly money. And if they have not met the terms of the contract , we should get a fair share of the penalty back. They did this for four years. And to my knowledge , we've never fined them. And if the problem is on the city side, I want to know because we need to fix it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 I remember last week somebody mentioned , was it, GASB 75? I'd like an explanation about that. I understand that the Sewer Authority is always late or, you know, Sewer Authority it's the municipal authority that would not die. But we've really got to get moving on this. The new auditor won't even be able to begin work until this old audit is put to bed. So we're going to automatically start out late. And you got to understand how important audits are. Just look what happened with the county when the Controller 's Office finally did an audit of the County Corner, hadn't been done since 2015. Guess what, the County Coroner had not been getting his contract s approved through the commissioners . The whole purpose of an audit is to reduce the risk of fraud, waste and abuse of taxpayer dollars . Now, we're just treating audits like they don't really matter. It's just like we don't need to fine Kohanski because after all, it's just taxpayers dollars . It's not important . Can you give me an update on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 arbitrations for the firefighters and police contracts ? MR. SCHUSTER : I did attend the second meeting of arbitration for the fire department on Monday. The city presented their side of it. And they scheduled their next meeting for this upcoming Monday. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, so at least they're meeting and talking . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, the police are going to be meeting later in the month. MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, I have been looking at the website every week. They're making progress in IT. They still have a ways to go, but at least they're starting to get documents posted. And it's getting organized . But I would remind you that next week if I don't get an answer about whether or not we're going to fine Kohanski , then I'll take my complaints elsewhere . And they'll be very, very public. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Next, Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . Last Thursday I attended the Recreation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Authority Board meeting . It was quite impressive . Mr. Gattens -- Bob Gattens , he really knows how to run a meeting . I think other boards and authorities should take some pointers from him. Norma Jeffries was there. She's a member of the board. She was quite impressive as well. Barb O'Malley -- it was really well run. I was really impressed . It was very pleasing to see Marissa Duffy, the Parks Director come. She was very informative . She mentioned that the swings at Nay Aug were not quite safe. And it this makes me wonder if the gem of the city Nay Aug Park swings are not safe, what would be the other parks be like? And Miss Duffy mentioned that she was a certified inspector . So I would like to see if she would, if she would please maybe inspect all the other parks for any faulty playground materials , swings, anything . It would be very helpful considering that she's an, you know, inspector and she's certified . What I want to speak to you tonight is about I gave you some picture s and a letter to the Scranton Times. Mr. McAndrew , would you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 please pass those pictures around to the other members so they could see them so they know what I'm speaking of? MR. MCANDREW : Sure. MS. FRANUS: I'd appreciate it. Speaking of what Joan said about abuse of taxpayer 's dollars , well, that's what I'm going to speak about in my opinion . Abuse, deception , fraud, and deceit -- deception , fraud and theft -- thefts of services . The people in Scranton pay a garbage fee. But the commercial businesses and the bars do not. But yet the DPW is picking up recyclable s at bars all the time for years. And it's not stopping . I went this morning and I took pictures to prove it. You have them in front of you. We pay -- the taxpayers pay $40 a ton at the Recycling Center. So what does that tell you? I ran into a bunch of DPW guys one day. And they all told me, yes, they do do this. They've been doing it for a long time. And one of the men even said that keeps us from doing more work because we're doing that when we could be doing something that we're suppose d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 to be doing. So what does that tell you? I guess they do it because they're told to do it. But who's telling them? Who's behind this? I want to know why. What is the reason that they're going around to these bars and commercial businesses , I'm sure, picking up the recyclables . It's not right. I sent the Recycling Program supervisor an e-mail January 10th with a photo that you have on your desk of the same bar that I went to today. But I got there after they already picked up. But then I went today. I got the facts. But she wrote back and she told me that we do not service bars or commercial businesses . They are just using the cans that they had a long time ago. But that's certainly not true. So I would hope that she looks into this. And she's the supervisor , checks into, find out why they're doing this and stop it immediately . We are paying $40 a ton a week -- taxpayers , garbage fee. They are not. Some of these bars have about 18 cans. So a family might have one can, maybe two, but 18? One bar had, like, 10.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 So they're all over the city. The bar next to Houdini on Main Avenue, McGinty 's, I mean, you name it. They're getting their garbage -- the recyclable s picked up. You know how they have bottles , tin cans, that's a lot of weight. That's a lot of money that we're paying. So I don't know what you could do as Council . But I would hope you would look into this and see that it's stopped because I could certainly find out every two weeks if it's still continuing and it should stop immediately . They have to get their own private haulers . That's what you're suppose d to do. That's what the City Code says. This is yet another law that the city is not following , another one. Why do we have laws if you're not going to follow them? How many times when people come up to the podium here and said we have laws. Joan says it many times. Nobody is listening to them. And, you know, I'd like someone to get back to me on this somehow . I mean, it seems like we always ask question s and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 nobody ever gives us answers . Marie came up here one time and asked five questions . Silence . Not even a yes, no, I don't know, nothing , just nothing . So I'm asking you to please find out and get to the bottom of this. And since it's a law and since we're paying for it and they're not paying anything , they're getting away with not paying private haulers so they love it. Why are the DPW doing this? Is Larry West even aware of this? Does he even know? If he doesn't, I hope somebody would tell him because he's the director . So the bucks stop with him. And the buck stops with the recycling supervisor . So thank you very much and I appreciate your time. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Horvath . MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Voldenberg , I have the picture s here. I'll give to you and the correspondence with it and would you please contact DPW and look into this for us? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Next up, Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Bob Bolus, Scranton . Under the Rules of Council , you know, we have things set down for the people if they say something out of line or something like that. What happens if the Council President violates the Rules of Council , who removes him? MR. MCANDREW : I'm not sure of that answer. MR. BOLUS: Pardon? MR. MCANDREW : I'm not sure of that answer. MR. BOLUS: Well, I think we need to have an answer that here we have the Council President has sole discretion over everybody that's here, including Council members . But nobody has anything in their discretion to remove the Council President if he so violates the Rules of Council . That's just something I think you should look into. And the reason I brought it up, past president Gaughan violated the Rules of Council and it was directed against me. And he's in a federal lawsuit right now. And it's going to establish a rule that if the Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 violates it, he can't remove himself . He's got to be removed by other Council members . And I believe that's something you should look into. And I've taken him into federal court now on a violation of the rules. And it's people like this that shouldn 't be representing people and be in a position of authority and vitriol to people that come here. After all, we are the employees -- or the employers rather of the Council . You are here to represent the citizens of the city, not represent yourselves. So that was just something he had pulled and I just thought I'd bring it up. It might be something that should be changed. And you are the powers that could change within yourselves. If we look around here and see what's been going on, there's no question the money coming into this city, put a pool back in Nay Aug. Enough of the stupidity and nonsense that we've seen going on filling it in with dirt and doing everything . Take the dirt out, put the pool back, give the people in this city a pool, not a stupid splash park. That's the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 most idiotic thing I've seen or ever heard of in the history of this city. Next off, I think we should turn around and take Biden's name off Interstate 81, off the expressway and off downtown Scranton . He's made a laughingstock of all of us in this country . Look at the ignorance and the cowardness on his part to shoot the balloon down while it goes right across our country . This isn't a guy in power. This is a guy in confusion. It's unfortunate he came from Scranton . He did very little for Scranton . And we need to make changes . And you are the powers to do it, but don't embarrass all of us. Put it on a referendum in the primary coming up and let us vote who we want and what street we should have. It's the only right thing to do. And it's about time everybody took the courage to stand up for all the people, not a select few. And Griffin Pond, I know we have to put a lot more energy in helping up there. I've donated thousands of dollars of Fresh Pet dog and cat food to them and as well as to the cat place in Nay Aug. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 We have a great relationship with them. So they call us when they have the food and we pick it up and deliver it and see that they get where it's got to go. But they do one hell of a job and take a lot of abuse from a lot of people for no reason. I have trailer loads of disinfectant wipes that we're donating out. All they have to do is call my office, make arrangement s to get them. The charities or anybody that wants them could have them. And we're trying to do as much for the people in this community considering what's gone on. I think that's pretty much where we want to go. I have just one quick question and I'm going to direct it to Jessica if she had made a decision as to identify her profession as we requested ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I respond ed a few weeks ago at the meeting you were at previously . I think you had left at that point. It was in Fifth Order. But, no, I'm not planning on changing the name plate that's below. MR. BOLUS: Okay. So you're just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 going to leave it as such which you have the right to call yourself doctor. We understand that. But I think it's a misrepresentation to a lot of the people in the medical field that are MDs and professional doctors . And it was just a courtesy to them. I have a lot of friends. I have family. And I think it's a courtesy to all of them. They're the ones that prescribe us to go to PT. And unfortunately , I'm not here to pick on you or anything else. I'm just looking at what's credible and right. It's a hell of a profession you're in. I go to a physical therapist . So I'm not challenging it or saying you shouldn 't call yourself doctor. I'm just saying please let the people know what type of doctor you are. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you for your concern . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Bolus. Next up, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . First off, let me remind Council I am probably the second largest plagiarist in Lackawanna 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 County. So much that I say here I repeat from hearing it during the week and so forth. Now, Debbie Dominick is probably the best known recipient of what's known in our circles as phone calls for favors. This has probably been going on since the invention of the telephone . Fortunately for the ones on the receiving end of the phone call, you couldn't be -- turn out better. If you're on the other like I've been once or twice, it could be a very expensive , needless waste of time and money for such small trivial things like rubbish . I know you people haven't kept up, but I have a court date for rubbish . Never heard of such a waste of time and money going on. All the things going -- last week I talked about just one single block that I live on all that's happening . Did anybody lift a finger to investigate it? Did anybody get in a car and go look at the yards tore up? I ask you -- when they reassessed my house, how can -- how can I get the fact over that it's worth half as much as it was a few years ago because of a couple houses on my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 street? Nobody seems to care. The Council -- Debbie Dominick doesn't care. Jerry doesn't care. I told you once when you mess with my pocketbook it makes me irritable . There's a lot of irritable people speaking to me recently . I think it's time for Debbie Dominick to retire. She's not going to win the covenant liar's trophy. That has to go Bulzoni . This man broke bread -- he was like a siamese twin to brother Bill for years. And he denies any knowledge of Bill's transgressions . How could -- how could anybody say something like that? You see how fast Amoroso left town. He wasn't going to -- he looked like a bullet getting out of here when everything hit the fan, but not Bulzoni . I'll give him credit for his stupendous display of denial that he didn't know nothing . Is this the caliber of people we need working for the city? Look at what Oleski's done to me over rubbish . And it's a false claim that a man -- Sunday (inaudible ) in court. You didn't see him in here and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 confront me when I accused him of it. You know, the city -- I was offered three, four years ago when the housing was so good, I had three our four phone calls to buy my house for a profit. I said, no, I don't want to go nowhere . I really wish I had taken it now and done you a favor and done me a favor. Now it's not worth what it was then. And it's going to go down more with the big lie about the reassessment . That makes -- you people are -- you're just out of touch with the reality of what's happening to the people of this city. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you for allowing me -- MR. SMURL: Mr. Ellman, I spoke with Chief Carroll about vehicles parking on the property in front of their houses and crossing over sidewalk s and parking in yards. And I also inquired about commercial trucks and vehicle s which was part of the problem too. He explained to me that he has a new director and, I guess, in the traffic division ; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 and they are looking into the ordinance to see what they could do with that. Okay? MR. ELLMAN: Well, I appreciate your time and consideration . I thank you. Give me one second, just one second more. Next door to me for 25 years is a fellow. He's 94 years old now. The people that got thrown out of the house next to me that caused all of this commotion to start with, moved in with this 94 year old man. I haven't seen him in a month. I phoned the police last Thursday . They never told me what happened . His whole -- everything he's done for 25 years is stopped . He went for breakfast . He has a new Cadillac he drives. Everything is different . Sunday -- MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: -- I knocked on the door. The people refused to open the door and let me speak to him. This is what I'm saying. Here, I tried to do the right thing. Nobody gives a damn about it in this city. The police don't care. Nobody as far as senior citizens case -- MR. MCANDREW : Your time is up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Your time is really up. You could elaborate next week. MR. ELLMAN: All right. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Next up is Jonas Crass. MR. CRASS: Good evening, Council President King, Vice President McAndrew and Honorable Council members . First I would to thank you all for your service to our beautiful City of Scranton . My name is Jonas Crass. I'm a Scranton native, born and raised in the Hill Section and currently reside on East Mountain . I come before you all today, not only as a local resident but as a staff member of Congressman Cartwright's DC offices . As many of you may already know, Congressman Cartwright holds a Municipal Leader's Conference every year to which over 400 municipal leaders from mayors to council members , borough managers to township secretaries are invited to attend. This year on February 22nd from 6 to 8 p.m., at Northampton Community College in Tannersville , PA, the Congress man will be holding tabletop discussions to discuss 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 community improvement through the Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act, grants, economic development , emergency management as well as police and fire with local municipality leaders . While I understand Tannersville is a bit of a drive, I implore each of you to try your best to make it to the conference and take the time out of your busy schedules . I'm happy to see that local community leaders such as Mayor Paige Cognetti , will be attending the events. However , of the 120 leaders from Lackawanna County invited to this event, only 12 have confirmed that they'll be able to make it. And of the 14 municipal leaders of the City of Scranton that were invited , only three have confirmed that they will be able to make it. For this reason, I chose attend to this local Council meeting outside of my work hours to come before you all, not as a staff member of Congress man Cartwright , but as a proud Scranton ian to ask each of you to proudly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 represent the City of Scranton and Lackawanna County at Congressman Cartwright's Municipal Leader's Conference on February 22nd. If interest ed, I printed for each of you an invitation for the event as well as e-mailed your staff offices as well as called them to try to get ahold of you to no avail. But again, this may have just been of accident . Thank you all for your time and attention and dedication to the City of Scranton and it's fine people. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That exhausts our list. Would anybody else like to speak? MR. HOGAN: Good evening. I want to thank you for allowing me in here. This is my very first time coming to a meeting like this. My name is James Hogan. I just wanted to simply introduce myself to you guys. I'm trying to -- I believe this city is really doing some great things right now and I appreciate that. I have a heart for the homeless . And I'm a pastor. I'm a minister to them. And behind the scenes we've been really quiet for a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 couple years now. But we're starting to really grow and I'm getting a lot of people to come down and help and mentor them and things. And I just wanted to introduce myself to you. We are going to -- we're going to start -- people will start to see us now. I'm trying to be, you know, as hummable as I can. But it's a big thing. It really is. We run into roadblocks a lot which is unfortunate . But, like, giving out hot chocolate and soup and being told from people that we can't do that and stuff it's hard. But, you know, I just wanted to let you know who I am and that we have a lot of people that are involved in this. We had over 100 people at our last event. Usually I would do the events on Sweeney Beech. We bring the homeless down. We feed them for an hour. We play songs with them. We just show them that we love them. It gives them hope. It stops a lot of them from suicide . We then -- I match them up with individuals from over 20 different churches . There's over 80 pastors involved . So it's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 really big thing. But I just simply wanted to introduce myself to you and tell you about Dark to Light. The 501C3 is almost finalized . Everything else is done. We are in the process of getting grants. I'm looking for a building in Scranton . But I assure you, I'm going to come here, you know, and I'm never going to be a problem for you. I want to tell you that I love all people. And I want love to spread through this whole entire region. And I'm seeing it happen. I really am. I'm seeing it happen. I love the fact that the Pinebrook section is getting revitalize d. It's beautiful . I've seen good things happening there. I've seen it all, like certain people being removed out of there. And I'm down there every day. And all the brook shoremen and all the residents there, like, I know them all, you know, and I love them because I was dropped off to be homeless four years ago. And I was saved. God saved my life. And this is why I do what I do. I have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 passion for it and every single day of my life I just love to help. I don't just help homeless people. I help everybody all day nonstop . It's just what I'm going to do. And I want to just tell you that I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I love people. I want you guys to know me. I want you to know me only because I've come up against a lot of obstacles . I believe that if we could help people and not want credit for it, man, this whole area would be such a better place, right? So I'm not calling out anybody . I'm not going to say any names. But I love all people no matter what. And eventually maybe we could all work together . The good thing is I have come in contact and I have been very close with a lot of directors of the organizations like the McAuley Center and Mary Pat over there and Rob William s at the kitchen and stuff. And we're doing good things. We're on the same page, like, trying to trade stuff with each other. If I have a lot of stuff donated , which I get tons of donations that will never sell and I told people that, we give 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 them to whoever needs them. They're not going to sit there. So we truly want no credit for what we do. We never will. We're not paid. We just want to help people and be a part of changing this city. And I really believe that's going to happen. It is happening right now, not from us, from everyone , you know. A lot of people see evil and bad in all. But I see a lot of good happening right now. So let me just make sure that I didn't forget anything . I pretty much said everything . I do have -- one thing I missed was I have a relationship s with probably 95 percent of the homeless in this city from getting them phones to getting them jobs at Wal-Mart. We have deals with both Wal-marts, the Targets . They also donate lots of money to me at a time. Everybody 's buying into it. And everybody is becoming a part. And it's so beautiful to see that people actually care out there. So I'm praying that everything continues to grow. But I just wanted to introduce 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 myself to you and tell you that I sincerely love everybody and even the people that are giving me these obstacle s and getting in the way for their own credit or whatever it may be, it's okay. We're still going to love them until we can all get along. So that's all I have to say. Thank you for your time. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Thank you for your work. Before I call the next speaker up, Mr. Crass, did you want to leave materials ? Did I cut you off at some point? I apologize . Do you want to just give them to Mr. Voldenberg ? That will be fine. Sorry about that. Okay. Would anybody else like to speak? MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is I intend to sit down with Jimmy Connors the former Mayor of Scranton on ECTV and do videos with him. And I just think that maybe the community should tune into ECTV and watch that. As far as the Frank Scavo videos, I don't see the reason why they came down. And to be honest with you, Chris Kelly and the Scranton Times, I appreciate their opinions . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 But maybe the Scranton Times should give me a little bit of space on their newspaper instead of coming in and wanting to sit down with me and Frank Scavo because I think Chris Kelly got this whole thing wrong. And I think his comments were his own. And it's his opinion . But it's not fact. So the Scranton Times can reach me at any time, 570-604-1212. And I challenge them to offer me the opportunity to put my public comments in their newspaper . And I think that bullying on a little TV station called ECTV where you could make comment s and scare people and get them to remove videos isn't the way a newspaper should operate . The other thing I have here is I had an opportunity to be on WILK this week. Nickki Stone offered me the chance to come in and talk. And I sat down with her for a couple hours. I really would hope that the city and the Council and the Mayor -- like I said on WILK, I think the Mayor made a big mistake by removing the slide. You know what, you can't revisit the past. The city can replace the slide. But we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 have to move forward with a pool project . I don't think it's realistic the way the park is funded by the city. And I think the city has an obligation to fund Nay Aug Park instead of relying on donations and the Recreational Authority . I don't think it's -- I think the Recreational Authority is doing a great job. I do have faith in its new members . I just -- I really think that the Council needs to sit down. The Mayor needs to sit down. And the Rec Authority needs to sit down at a table. I'd like to offer them the opportunity to come to ECTV and sit down with me and have a discussion , not because I'm important but because I want to see a pool constructed . And I don't have any time for politics , none. I think it's time for the government itself to realize the obligation they have to the children in this city to have a safe place to learn to swim, okay, and to play. And I think it's time for the Mayor to realize that she's made mistakes . It's time to rethink where she 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 stands on every issue. And I'm extremely concerned about Parks and Recreation going into Nay Aug and doing landscaping because I see what's happened at other city parks. The one across from Anthracite has just been completely -- I can't understand why somebody would take down a fence that's a barrier to protect children from animals or from chasing balls in the road or whatever it may be. And we've just lost our way as a city. We really have. There's a lot more issues to discuss . And if Nickki Stone offers me the opportunity to come to her channel I will. But I think that when you listen to the comment s she has receive d, I think there's a lot of support for the things that I'm saying. And I'm sure there is some detractors too. But you know something , I think our government has not served us for a very long time. And we need a government that can do that. We need a government where we have a Council that could answer questions and take criticism and not ignore the residents and we don't have that. We have a lot of people who run for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 public office, but I don't think they understand what their obligation is. And we need a city government to reach out to the Scranton School Board and help them to craft a plan for the reconstruction of the school district . You can't put all this weight on the school district because we all have to work together . The children deserve to inherit something worth owning. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . Is there anybody else there who can tell me how many exempt from paying property taxes there are in the city? MR. MCANDREW : How many businesses or the percentage ? MS. SCHUMACHER : No, number, number of them that do not pay property taxes. MR. MCANDREW : That's information we could get you. I don't think anybody sitting here has the exact number. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. How many do you think pay pilots? MR. MCANDREW : Not a lot. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MS. SCHUMACHER : Payments in lieu of taxes, I'm sorry. I shouldn 't be speaking with acronyms . MR. MCANDREW : Not enough. MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon? MR. MCANDREW : Not enough, believe me. We just got the list recently and it's not -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Take a guess? MR. MCANDREW : Seven or eight -- eight. I think eight. MS. SCHUMACHER : Did Frank give you what he got? He did -- he was very prompt in getting that list to me but it's pathetic . And I really think you guys need to have a caucus among yourselves and anybody else you think might be able to offer some help in how you get these people to cough up a little bit. I mean, it's just -- it's really pathetic . And I think the administration personal ly should be going out. I don't know if the Mayor -- do you know if the Mayor goes out and meets with any of these people to -- or any of these nonprofits to try to get them to make a donation in lieu of taxes?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MR. MCANDREW : I don't know. MR. SCHUSTER : -- (inaudible ) in 2022 pilots and we only received nine payments . MS. SCHUMACHER : How many? MR. SCHUSTER : Nine. MS. SCHUMACHER : Nine, yeah. So there's a lot of work to be done there and hopefully some money as well. Now, I would like to I guess -- speak of the building and agree and disagree with Joan because the building needs to be opened up. Making a call to anybody to -- if you can't get in because you don't -- nobody answers their phone in this building it seems. Well, I shouldn 't say that. I mean, Council always answers , Controller 's office. And Kelsey I know always does a good job. But I called IT today twice because I wanted to -- I was trying to find the code on the website . And I searched . I put in code for search. And I came up with nine pages. I didn't know there were that many codes and subcodes. But guess which one wasn't there? The city's. So I called and I asked for somebody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 to call me back and tell me where they had it hidden. And I didn't get a call. I called back again and -- a second time and I didn't get a call back. Now, you know, in the old days when we could come in, you could go directly to somebody 's office and ask them. But now you just have to be frustrated . And I don't think that's a good -- I think the IT needs a whole lot of help. And to another subject , the no name bridge that when you come down past the Salvation Army in South Scranton there, the area -- you might ]have read about it in the paper; but there's cement barriers . And if I'm not mistaken like I could be, but they're going to be there for a while. And the lighting down -- coming from South Scranton into Bellevue is not that well lighted . And there are some lights that would take you if you didn't know where you were going, it could take you off there. And then if you go around these barriers if you follow the line that's there you would probably have an accident . So I think, you know, I don't think there's any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 problem in leaving them there; but they need to put -- the DPW needs to put some paint on that like a nice bright yellow so people don't go into the barrier or don't go into another car. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , could you inquire about that, please? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, I would like to bring to the attention since we're talking about raising flags, in 17 days it will be one year since the invasion of Ukraine . We should take a time out in this city to recognize the year and the suffering that the people of Ukraine have had to go through and the hardship s. It's been a long time. It's a long, long war. And some of it's gone to the background and to the back side. And I think it would be nice if the city could honor them in some way. There's a Ukrainian church is prominent here as well as Chamberlain , the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 ammunition plant is actually -- supplies a lot of the military armaments as a -- the shells that go over there. There was an article in the paper specifically about that. Now, onto a few different subjects . I brought up to this body information on electric cars. I have to go back to Mr. Donahue and his speaking before this body. Originally there was a grant put through for 5 or 10 percent of the price for electric cars and for installing electric charging stations . There was no decision on where or when. It was just a small amount of money to get the ball rolling . I put forward that I had heard that the money was going to be coming out of the recovery act. And I was told, you don't know what you're talking about. It's not coming from there. Whoever gave you the information, that's bad news. Well, surprising enough $900,000 appeared listed in that fund for those electric cars. A lot's changed about electric cars and our knowledge of them in the past couple of years. From 81 -- or 84 and the car catching on fire as it was driving , electric car taking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 12,000 gallons of water and two hours to extinguish . In the packet I have buses overseas that spontaneously lit on fire and lit not one but three buses next to them and burned them into nonexistence . Are we going to put these charging stations possibly at the DPW yard or Serrenti Center? I hope when one of those burns down and takes the equipment around it, the City of Scranton is not only ready for the insurance claims for all of those properties and all the equipment nearby them, but increased insurance rate because the cover will be not a cheap cost. They are out of garages for very specific reasons . When they burn, they burn hot. When they are sitting charging they light themselves on fire. When they're driving down the streets they ignite. If we had cars spontaneously combusting in garages we wouldn't go, you know, it just happens . I think we did that with the Pinto once. We also have electric charges . Electric right now when you look at gas and electric , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 electric costs just about as much to charge a car up as gasoline at this point. It's no longer a cost savings unless you were running a charging station out of your home itself. Usually it is depending upon if it's fast charger , you're looking at 30 to 50 dollars to fully charge up an electric car. We also have in the packet CO2. A lot of stuff says it's less carbon dioxide . It's not true. It's just less carbon dioxide from the point of being sold to the recover y point they say is about a year and a half but excludes the cost on purchasing them. It also excludes the cost of the battery themselves replacement after a short period. So I've given you a lot of information to review there. With $900,000 and the $900,000 from the splash park and the half -- $500,000 from the pickleball course, that would be a nice start towards a swimming pool. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anybody else that would like to speak tonight ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MOTIONS . MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes. The first is I'd like congratulate Scott Pietreface has been appointed to Director of DPW. I met him a few weeks ago and he seems pretty competent . I believe he'll do a good job for the city. And I would also like to thank the Mayor for appointing somebody that lives in City of Scranton . Also, Mr. Voldenberg , since we have a new DPW Director , may we ask him if we are picking up recyclables that we shouldn 't if they would stop it? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question , sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. The walkability study has begun. If you are downtown , you will see some cameras that are on poles. They are monitor ing naturally the areas that they're going to be studying. We do have a map of the streets that they are thinking of changing and the stop signs and stuff. If anybody wants a map like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 just either e-mail Mr. Voldenberg or see me at the end of the meeting and I'll get you one. And it will show you what's going on there. And also, Mr. Voldenberg , if you will ask Director Duffy -- I believe she's certified in inspecting playground equipment if she will inspect the equipment at Nay Aug Park and send a report back to Council if there is any deficiencies in the existing equipment there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : So a few comments . First off, Mr. Voldenberg , can you please send correspondence to HR as well as the BA's Office to ask -- as well as the Mayor to ask one of the comment s that was brought up tonight in Fourth Order and I think I probably know the answer but if we can ask it anyway, will they look to implement the 10 percent penalty on the auditor s for not having the audit complete d by September as well as an explanation of why the GASB 75 wasn't on time. I know I had some correspondence 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 back to July about that specifically because it's done every few years. And I never really got an explanation of why that was the last piece of information that the auditors needed. That's the first one. The second one we did get an update. I think Dr. Rothchild will probably update us with that. But Eileen Cipriani is going to come in and give us an ARPA update at some point. They're just waiting for the final rules to come out on that. I do think some good points were raised tonight when it comes to funding for the pool. When looking at the ARPA plan that was done some time ago, there were a few things on there that I think need to be reviewed and possibly updated and things that may not make sense at this point in time that we may be able to shore up some funds. I know we spoke about the electric vehicles when it was first put on the table. I mean, unless we're buying vehicles every five years, I think it's going to be a headache that the city gets into. I know once you buy new batteries for these vehicles , all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 the savings you've accrued in those five years is out the window. So I really don't think it's something that the city should be getting into. I do know that we do have some grants. But those grants don't even touch the final cost of what it's going to be. So I do think it's a -- it's going to be a silly situation for us to get into. And then I do have a few other things that I'll bring up with Frank. I mentioned a few in caucus but I'll follow up with you, Frank, and we'll take care of them over the week. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : In terms of the ARPA updates , hopefully the final rules will be published soon and then Miss Cipriani will be happy to come in and provide us with an update and we could see if there any other possibilities that that money could be used towards. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. King, do you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 any motions or comments ? MR. KING: I'll reserve any comments for our meeting next week. Thank you very much. MR. MCANDREW : Okay, thank you. I have a couple. So I was contact ed by a member of the community about a morning drop-off at Neil Armstrong . The concern is the corner of Theodore and Sumner where kids are getting dropped off only has one stop sign. It's a busy section with cars and buses and some kids cross there. So, Mr. Voldenberg , would you please contact highway s and see if we could do some type of study over there -- a safety study? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. And next, so I don't know, about a week ago a resident came to me and had concern about her garbage being -- her garbage fee bill that she keeps receiving . She owns a double. And the other side hasn't been rented in 20 years. So I know that we talked about exonerations two years ago when the fees were going to be embedded in the taxes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 which is a great idea. The collectability is great. But issues remain. So I remember they worked a little bit towards it and started exonerating people that had apartments that haven't been rented in 20 years. So we inquired about this. And I received an answer from the treasurer 's office -- the City Treasurer 's Office that a permanent exoneration in order to get one you have to pull the power meter and confirm permanent vacancy . So I don't know about you, I never heard this before. The two big cold snaps we had this year, which I had my washing machine pipe was frozen. So I can't see -- this is extreme to me. I can't wrap my head around in order to not pay a garbage fee in a 20-year vacant apartment , you have to disconnect the power. So could you please reach out -- back to everybody involved . Clarify this to me that this is -- because this is new to me. I don't know if anybody else heard this. But I don't think this is fair. I think it's extreme . So if you could please look into that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 for me. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. So we talked about the appointment of the DPW Director . So what's suppose d to happen, we all got an e-mail. But what's supposed to happen it's suppose d to come down through us, through Council . That hasn't happened yet. That was part of the (inaudible ) last year that we agreed upon. So could you please reach out to administration and ask them if they're going to follow the process that we all agreed upon? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out tomorrow , sir. MR. MCANDREW : And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF DIANA BLANK, 415 W.

MR. MCANDREW : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-H be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , we had a little bit of a discussion about this in caucus. And I remember when OpenGov was coming on board, there was a discussion that we had and a presentation that stated that -- I'm not sure if it's OpenGov that a company was going to marry all of the systems that the city uses in the IT Department . Mr. Voldenberg , I could submit an e-mail, but if you would also send correspondence . Was it OpenGov that -- was it part of the OpenGov contract that these systems would be married to communicate with each other or was this part of the Bedrock contract ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 Right now offhand I can't think if it was part of the OpenGov contract or part of the Bedrock contract . And with that being said, can we also get an update on what our relation -- what the city's relationship is currently with Bedrock ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do both, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? ATTY. GALLAGHER : After looking at the backup, it's kind of -- not kind of, it is an incomplete -- but it looks like -- I don't know if legal just forgot to attach the rest of the backup. But there is no certificates . There's no bonding or anything like that. So whether you want to introduce it or not tonight or table it, that's up for you guys to decide right now. But we need to get more information for the bid to be complete to enter into the contract . MR. MCANDREW : I agree. Let's get this information before it reaches Seventh Order. Okay. MR. SCHUSTER : Also, Mr. Gallagher , we discussed in caucus about the other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 bidders -- the other bid. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yeah, they should be sent down as well. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Anybody else? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I did just want to point out that this would allow us, like, this program would allow us to communicate externally , not just fit internally like OpenGov does but externally with the tax assessors office or to gather data from the post office to help us better identify rental properties or how many rentals there are in a property because right now there are a lot of issues with that where they're looking into say a property that they pay a trash fee for three apartments but there's actually six apartments actually at the place. So it will help fill in the holes for data like that. And OpenGov just doesn't seem to have the capabilities for that wider scale that they are looking for to help with the rental program s. So I believe that is the reasoning behind this contract . That's all. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : I would agree with that. But, I mean, when we're looking at some of the contracts we've already had just to make sure that they're keeping up their end of the bargain . So if this was something that we didn't move forward with or we've separated with Bedrock that's one thing. But if OpenGov is supposed to be doing some of this work, I would like to see that they're fulfilling their part of the contract . DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree. I have no problem looking back into our OpenGov contract . OpenGov was one of the bidders on this. But it didn't seemed to be any different from what they had in the contract that was going to offer what we were looking for as a city from what I've been informed . I agree. MR. MCANDREW : That's interesting because OpenGov was suppose d to be the end all be all for us and obviously maybe that's not the case. Anybody else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 51, 2023 – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING THE MEMBERSHIP PROVISIONS OF THE HOUSING BOARD OF APPEALS . MR. MCANDREW : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SMURL: On the question , this board -- I was chair of this board for many years. And usually boards are easy to fill. This board, however , has specific qualifications . And that's controlled by the UCC (inaudible ) for control of the code that the city adopted . So the restriction s are you must be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 either licensed to work in the field, be an architect , an engineer , work in the trades. There's a lot of things like that. And also, if you make -- you are on this board and you make any decisions on any properties in the city which are condemned or are on the demolition list, you are not allowed to work at them or bid on them. So being a contractor on this board you lose a lot of work if that's the type of work you do. And while I was on the board there was normally -- normally if you look back there were only three, very few occasions were there four. So with the difficulty of getting five full-time members and two alternates , I understand the city's look to change this to three with two alternates . As long as there are three people on the board I'll say and one isn't going to be there and you have another alternate -- just so you have three people at all times. That would be great. And that's why I would be voting to move this. That's all I have. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. I'm going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 to be voting against this tonight . Looking to change the amount of people on this board from five to three I feel there is some concern s that I have. I don't want to see a quorum of two or maybe there's a split vote. And I think with this it doesn't -- we're not guaranteed two alternates . Currently we have five members with the alternates . I think there's more of an opportunity to have more opinions . When it comes to this board I do understand it's hard to get members for the board. However , with the current makeup it would guarantee that we have three members voting. With the new makeup it wouldn't be guaranteed that there would be three people seated. So I will be voting against this. MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I will be voting for this. I understand the difficultie s that this board has in getting five full-time members and two alternatives . And that may be a stretch considering the requirements for this board. I haven't really heard of any other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 alternatives on how to fill this board. So for that reason I'll be voting for it. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. I'm voting no. I'm going to tell you why. First of all, the zoning members has five members . Why can't -- and I understand it might be hard. Work a little harder. Fill these seats because at the end of the day, a quorum is two. I don't like that when you have three. So I feel there would be problems with that because the zoning board, you know, makes all of these decisions . I think based on five thought processes , I don't want to leave it to two. So I'm just not comfortable . If there was something written in there where a meeting can't occur unless there's three members I'd have an appetite for it. But I don't want to see a meeting with two members . And alternate s, you know, alternates are alternates . They don't always commit and they're not always reliable . I'm not saying anybody individually . But for them reasons , I'm voting no. So anybody else? You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? Oh, I already read 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 that. So, all right, you know, so on the question , we already did that. I'm sorry, I slipped up here a little bit. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.
