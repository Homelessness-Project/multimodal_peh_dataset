Now,anyone whodoesn'tunderstand thatwater,stormwaterisabigissuein theCityofScranton probably wasn'toutand aboutlastnight.Stormwaterissues are requiring resolution --requiring resolution areabundant andeffect thequality oflife duetosomestormwaterflooding anddamage. Forothers,stormwaterisabigissuefor allproperty owners andtheScranton Sewer Authority ratepayers asdealing withstorm watertakesmoney,inmanycaseslotsof money.GiventheAmerican Water'sproposal didnotinclude stormwater,atleastthree1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 alternatives seempossible .Either thecity contracts withAmerican Watertoassume the MS-4management orwediditin-houseorwe rejectthesaleandallowtheSewer Authority tofunction perthelong-term control planandtransfer theMS-4permit to them,whichiswhattherecommendation and report was. Alloptions involve rextracting more feesfromproperty owners unless anyofyou areabletoprovide another alternative .I doubtthatyoucan.Property owners needto knowwhichalternative eachofyousupports . SonextweekIwillgivepartofmyfive minutes tohaveeachofyoutellmewhat youroption ofchoice isfordealing with thestormwaterafteryoureview the materials I'mproviding heretonight . Untilsuchtimeasthis administration decides toprovide some transparency towhattheyhaveuptheir sleeve,Ifavorrejecting theAmerican Water sale,butI'mopentopartial leaseand certainly somelightonwhattheyareabout. Thefirstquestion thatneedsanswering is1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 whether itislegally possible forthecity totransfer theMS-4permit toaprivate entity,albeit onethatisaccountable to thePublicUtility Commission .Thenext question iswhichentity wouldbemore responsive toratepayers'stormwater issues,aprivate corporation oramunicipal authority ? According tothereport whichwas issued onthe31stofOctober ,2013,the MS-4,whichagainisthesanitary storm water,makesup37percent oftheentire system andtheScranton SewerAuthority currently ownsalloftheinfrastructure . IftheMS-4management isbrought in-house wouldthecityhavetobuybackthe37 percent fromtheSewerAuthority orwillit betransferred freeofcharge? Perthereport,theSewerAuthority hasanextensive mapping system fortheCSS, again,thestormwaterportion ofthe system,orthecombined ,buttheMS-4 remains unmapped.Howisitpossible to transfer something forwhichnomapexists? Couldthismapping beaccomplished priorto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 theplanned execution ofthesaleandifso atwhatprice?Weneedthoseanswers . Now,again,fromthereport,while theCitylacksincapacity and organization alstructure tohandle storm watermanagement activities ,theSewer Authority hasbeenplaying amajorrolein assisting withthemaintaining ,assisting with,andmaintaining thefunctions ofthe stormwatersystem.Adecision ontheMS-4 permit homeissorely needed.Ifthepermit stayswiththecityweneedabudget for personnel andequipment required andan estimate oftheannual valueofwhatthe assistance fromthesewerauthority hasbeen because wearegoingtohavetoprovide it.

Iwouldliketospendamoment and talkaboutameeting thatmyself and Councilmen Evanshadwitharepresentative fromtheFriends ofLackawanna thisweekwho isfighting theexpansion ofthelandfill andI'mextremely concerned bythe information thatwewereprovided andI'd liketotakeaminute andreadasummary of theevents thathavetakenplace. Onseparate occasions ,Keystone1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 SanityLandfill hasadmitted todischarging treated leachate downtheGreenridge sewer line,including thenightofthesolvent , foulodorincident September 24,2015.Such discharge sviolate thelandfill 'swaste waterdischarge permit issued bythe Scranton SewerAuthority inMarch2012 that'sgoodthrough March2017.TheSewer Authority permitonlyallows thelandfill to discharge itstreated leachatethrough the dedicated line.Thelandfill andSewer Authority haveunilaterally --ortheSewer Authority seemstohaveunilaterally changed thepermit onDecember 17,2015,afterthe odorincident inGreenridge toallowthe landfill todischarge thetreated leachate downtheGreenridge lineaswell,andthis appears tobeaviolation ofthewastewater permit andsettlement agreement withlocal residents from1990intheCityofScranton , whichisveryconcerning . Justtogivealittle background on this,backinthelate1980'sScranton City Council andresidents strongly objected to theflowofleachatethrough theGreenridge1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 combined seweroverflow linesbecause itwas morelikely forleachate tooverflow directlyintotheLackawanna river,backup intoresident 'shomeorfortoxins and smells toreachresidents abovegrade.The landfill suedthecityciting a1987letter fromtheSewerAuthority andin1990a settlement agreement wasreached whichlead totheconstruction ofthesewerlinethat wasnotcombined seweroverflowand dedicated onlytolandfill leachate .This dedicated linerunsthrough Spordville , Bunker HillandtheHillsection andonto theSewerAuthority treatmentplant. Because partofthelineisuphill, ithastobepumped whereastheGreenridge lineisgravity fed.Wehaveaskedour solicitor toreview thesettlement agreement andthelandfill 'swastewaterdischarge permit,whichasImention edwaschanged on December 17,2015,todetermine whether or notthelandfill isinviolation ofthe1997 settlementagreement withtheCityof Scranton . AndIwouldalsoaskoncewefind1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 outinformation fromoursolicitor thata letter besenttotheSewerAuthority ,DEP andNEPAinquiring astowhythisdischarge permitwasallowedtobechanged toallow leachatetorunthrough theGreenridge line.

Icontinue tohaveserious concerns aboutleachaterunning through Greenridge andthequestion ofwhether ornotthe landfill should beallowed toexpand.Inmy opinion ,thesearetwoofthemost significant issues facing ourcityandour region.Willwecontinue tobeadumping ground forout-of-statetrash?Willthe landfill become asymbol forourregion?I willalways believe thatthehealth,safety, andwelfare ofourresidents should come first.Sohopefully whenoursolicitor is1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 backnextweekwewillhaveananswer on someofthoseissues.
