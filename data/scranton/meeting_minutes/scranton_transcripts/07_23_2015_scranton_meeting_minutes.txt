"I'mappalled bycitycouncil 's recent consideration ofanamendment tothe City'scurrent bidding procedures .InMarch 2010,council leadbyJanetEvanspassed legislation lowering thecompetitive bidding threshold from$20,000to$10,000.The intention wastoboostthecompetitiveness andtransparency inordertogetthebest dealforthetaxpayers .Formanyyearsthe common practice wasforcontracts tobe awardedtopolitical cronies andthose associated withthegoodole'boyclub. Councilman PatRoganwasastrong supporter ofthenewpolicy.Hewentsofar astosayhewasnotonlypro-taxpayer ,he ispro-business aswell.Nowthings seemto havechanged .Mr.Roganandhiscouncil colleagues haveindicated thattheywill consider raising thebidding threshold from $10,000to$19,400.Hebelieves itwillcut advertising costsandincrease transparency1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 byadvertising on-line.Thecityhaspaid foradvertising fordecades .Mr.Roganis trying totakethetaxpayers forfools.I won'tfallforhisgames.Ifcouncil amends the2010ordinance itissimply endorsing no bidcontracts ,removing transparency ,and continuing theCity'slongtradition of pay-to-playpolitics .Igetakickoutof howMr.Roganhaschanged histuneonmany issues.Heisnowshowing histruecolors. Isuppose hefindsthechanges pro-taxpayer ." Andthatwasaletter thatIhad submitted totheScranton Timesthatwas published intheWednesday ,July22, edition .Youknow,justagaintocontinue onmythoughts ofthisparticular proposed amendment ,Iwouldliketotakeusbackto March16,2010,whenthisissuewas--when thisamendment wasupforadoption in Seventh Orderbackthenand,youknow,I havealways saidthebeauty partofthese meetings ishaving thestenographer here because whenwehavetheseprinted they're inblackandwhiteandminutes don'tlie,it1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 speaksthetruth,andwhensomeone goesback onwhattheyinitial lydidorwhattheir thoughts wereonanissuewecanalways go backtotherecord,andI'dliketogoback tothat.Itooktimetopulluptheminutes fromtheTuesday ,March16,2010,Scranton CityCouncil meeting ,andinSeventh Order thisamendment onthebidding process wasup foradoption .Therewereonlythreecouncil members present thatevening ,Mr.Joyce, Mr.Loscombe andMr.Rogan.Mrs.Evansand Mr.Rogan--I'msorry,Mrs.Evansand Mr.McGoff wereabsent atthatevening ,and Iwouldjustliketoquoteastatement made byMr.Roganontherecord,thiswaswhenit wasonthequestion . "Iwouldjustliketoreiterate my support onceagain.Ibelieve thatthis willmakegovernment moreopen,itwillbe, asIhavesaidbefore,bothpro-taxpayer and pro-smallbusiness andIurgethemayorto signthisintolaw." ThatwasMr.Rogan'sstatement on therecord andthat'swhatIcitedinmy letter yesterday andalsocamefromthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Scranton Timesarticle published March3, 2010,whenthiswasintroduced initially in FifthOrder.Soit'sallinblackandwhite whereMr.Roganstoodontheissue. Infact,Mr.McGoff isalsoonthe record forstating hissupport ofthat amendment atthetime.Although ,hewasnot thereforthefinalvote,thereareminutes indicating hissupport atthetime.Alot ofbackandforthwentonasfarasthecost ofadvertising ,andthat'sbeenthepractice inthecityforyears,decades ,wehave spentmoneyonadvertising whether itwas thousands ofdollars ,whatever itwas,but thebottom lineiswhatitcomesdowntois thepositive aspects ofthewholething including ,mostimportantly ,the transparency faroutweighs thecostofthe advertising .That'snottheissue,but, unfortunately ,ourpolitical officials want tojambthatdownourthroat asawayto justplayusforfools.Thisisfarbeyond that.Thisisabouttransparency ,thisis aboutpay-to-playpolitics that'sbasically hadastranglehold overthiscityformany,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 manyyearsandhasleadtouswhereweare today,andthat'swherethiscouncil simply wanted totakeusbackto.Notinterested intheideaofadvertising on-line.Youcan advertise on-lineallyouwant,thathas nothing todowiththefactthatbydoing whatyouaregoingtodoisgoingtojustgo backtothesmokeandmirrors .

Secondly ,ontheEGfunding ,there isfunding forthepegchannel inthe contract tothetuneoftwo$100,000 payments increments foratotalof$200,000, thequestion isthat'suptothecityto decide thatsoIguessIwouldliketofind outfromtheadministration arethereplans tousethatspecifically forECTV,andI thinkthat'swherethemoneyshould go.I thinkthatwouldcertainly givetheman opportunity togrow,tobesustain ableon theirown,butthat'ssomething thatwehave tobeasking fornextweek.Arethereplans forthatmoneyspecifically directlyto ECTV. Iabsolutely agreewithCouncilman Wechsler ,I'mhoping to--Iwrotesome briefamendments downandthatwasoneof themandIknowwebrought itupbefore and IknowCouncilman Roganbrought upthe senior discount scenario andIthinkthose twothings arecritical .Youknow,it's1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 veryeasytodo.Thelanguage inthe contract reads:"AComcast service Center shallconvenient lybelocated andshallbe openduring normal business hours."To change thatto,"AComcast service center shallbeconveniently located within the CityofScranton andshallbeopenduring normal business hours." Andasfarasthesenior discount ,I don'tseewhywecouldn'tputthatlanguage intherethatsays,"Residents overtheage of65willqualify fora10percent discount offofbasiccableservice aswellasa10 percent discount onadditional cableTV services ." SomaybeIcanfinetunethe language withAttorney Minora orCouncilman Wechsler ontheoneissueandCouncilman Roganontheother.Theotherquestion I hadis,isa12-yearcontract more appropriate thanaten-yearcontract.Most ofthecontract sIhaveseenhavebeena 10-yearcontract . MR.GAUGHAN :Solicitor Minora,do youknowifweweretomaketheseamendments1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 woulditthenhavetogobacktoComcast and be-- MR.MINORA:Yeah,itwouldhaveto gobacktoComcast andComcast couldreject them. MR.EVANS:Theywould? MR.MINORA:Itwouldbe establishing anegotiation ,yes. MR.EVANS:Well,whatifwereject therejection ?Because ,Imean,whatweare asking themtodoisthesearebeyond -- I'lltellyou,Ithinkthecontract was actually verywellwritten ,verywelldone, verycomprehensive ,butIthinkthesearea couple ofthings thatareimportant .We havealargesenior population .Ithink Councilmen Wechsler makesthepointallthe timethattheyneedtohaveaplacetogo physically because that'showtheyroll,for lackofabetter word,andIthinkweneed tohavea--Ithinkweneedadiscount for theseniors . MR.MINORA:Another wayyoumight consider wouldbetotablethisandaskthe administration togobacktoComcast and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 renegotiate itaccording totheissues that youhaveraised andthatsortofshortcuts thebackandforthordinances and,youknow, newlegislation ,thatmightbeawaytodo it.Itmightbesomething todo. MR.EVANS:Well,doyoufeelthat byusamending itcouldbebasically --that wouldbemoreappropriate ? MR.MINORA:SoweareonlyinSixth Order,youknow,couldbetabled and/or movedontoSeventh Orderandtabled until theadministration hasanopportunity .I'm justsuggesting ,I'mnottrying toshortcut anything . MR.EVANS:Well,wedon'thaveto doittonight . MR.MINORA:No,wedon'thavetodo ittonight . MR.EVANS:Imean,wehaveworked onacontract forquitealongtimenow,I don'tthinkit'surgent,butIwanttosee something thatwouldfinally solidify ECTV's situation ,whichhasbeensortofhanging outthereforquitealongtimeand unfairly .Iknowthecounty hasgivenECTV1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 moneyonaregular basis,Ithinkannually thecityhasnotcontributed . MR.MCGOFF:Ithinkthatthe problem liesinthefactthatthiswasgiven touswithout adequate preparation .Ifthey havebeen--theadministration hadbeen negotiating thiscontract Ithinkitwould havebeenwisetoengage council inthis negotiation insomewayandthatwaywe couldhaveintroduced someoftheseideas anddetermined youknow,whether theywould werefeasible ornotfeasible .Rightnow, asIsaid,wehavebeengiventhisandwe havebeenaskedtovoteonitwithout any realintroduction tothecontract andtothe termsofthecontract soIagreewithour solicitor thatitmaybeinourbest interest to--wecouldmovethisforward thisevening andpriortoSeventh Order tableitorinSeventh Ordertableitand findoutif,youknow,Comcast isamenable tosomeofthesuggestions .Ifnot,canwe gobacktosquare oneandrenegotiate .
