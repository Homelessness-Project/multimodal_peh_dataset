LACKAWANNA COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT EVALUATION REPORTS RECEIVED OCTOBER 21, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have one comment on Item 3-E. It seems there's an increase in unemployment insurance . Can we ask if we needed a budget transfer to cover that? Can we ask if our unemployment has been up this year or if we just underestimated in the current budget? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question , sir. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have just a friendly reminder . DPW is having their annual Trunk or Treat this Saturday at DPW parking lot headquarters . And it's at 3:30 to 6 p.m. That's all I have. Thanks. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . MR. KING: Mr. President , we did forget to mention that Guy Valvano who was a long-time sports director for the Scranton Times. And that guy, what a gentleman and what an asset he was to the entire community . And he covered sports, high school sports, a lot of local athletes for many years. He was 96 years old, great family man. So I just want to recognize him. He just passed away and I believe his viewing is Sunday. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Okay. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . That was a very interesting caucus that you had. But I hope you are planning a part two and bring them back because I would assume you have a lot more questions . But I think it was a good thing to have and the public should pay attention . I will tell you one thing, if you go down to Washington DC and go to the IRS headquarters above the entrance of the building are the following words: Taxes are the price we pay for civilization . And I don't know about you, but I don't know how you are going to do it, but I want someone there when I have my stroke or my heart attack, I want someone there in four minutes or less. And I'd be willing to pay for that service . But I understand your quandary . But you should continue this conversation . And it's for the benefit of the people of Scranton . Okay, I checked the City's website , still no police collective bargaining agreement . Is any change in that? MR. SMURL: Not until it's all combined , same as the fire department . Once 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 it's combined , it will be up fully. Otherwise , it's the old contract and all of the arbitration awards. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, just so you know, Mr. Ufberg got paid 20,000 plus change in September . So he's chugging right along. DPW negotiations , are they on track? MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Because it's 70 days until the end of the year until when their contract runs out. And the audit, where do we stand? Does the Scranton Parking Authority got their {inaudible } one shoe yet? MR. SMURL: It's supposed to be this week. They said they'll have it this week. MS. HODOWANITZ : How many times have they said that? MR. SMURL: Well, that was -- they said this month. So they said they'll have it this week. And we are -- well, we're involved in that a little bit too. But as soon as we receive it, it will take us about two weeks to incorporate it into ours and then it will be finished . MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, well, one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 thing you need to get is a commitment from them that they'll arrange their audit services so they get that thing done before the end of September . So we don't have this constant , you know, well, it's the only thing we're waiting on. That's silly. The Career Technology Center, I saw the Item 5-B where the police department is going to donate a vehicle they no longer need. And I think that's a great idea. Now, Mr. McAndrew , you are a faculty member there. CTC, is that a nonprofit ? MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. HODOWANITZ : I would like to -- you know, people say, well, you know, payment in lieu of taxes and that's all fine and dandy. But, you know, a lot of these non-profit schools like the CTC, Johnson College , so on and so fourth, Lackawanna College , there's a significant brain trust within these organizations . And they have the opportunity if we ask them I think as a city for, you know, providing rather than money, services in kind. You know, you were talking the other week about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 the possibility of them helping out at the lookout to do a masonry project , if that's possible . And there is other ways they could serve. So I don't really have a problem with the city donating , you know, a used vehicle which probably wouldn't bring much on the market anyway to the school. It would benefit the students . But I would like to see closer relationships with these non-profits where if there is some service they could provide to the city or the citizens that we aren't shy about asking for their kind of help. MR. MCANDREW : Well, I could give you another example . MS. HODOWANITZ : Go ahead. MR. MCANDREW : And first of all, we're high school student s. So we're not Lackawanna College . MS. HODOWANITZ : I understand that, but your faculty is well trained . MR. MCANDREW : So the illustration and design class reached out to me and I reached out to the Bureau of Elections . So you know the stickers I just voted?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah. MR. MCANDREW : So the students took on that project to create their own, maybe a variety of five and signs that say this work is done by the Career Technology student s, you know, and I'm going to get them to the Bureau of Elections . But that is just another in-kind project . And it stimulates , you know, creativity in their content area. MS. HODOWANITZ : And it ends up being a win-win situation . You know, it's great for the student s. It's great for the school and it helps local government. And I think we need to get more creative in thinking about it because chasing pilots is not going to happen because they got their budget concerns too. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries . It's been a while since I have been here. I had some health issues, but thank God they're moving along. But this isn't what I was going to speak about tonight but it is on my agenda to speak about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 it in future meeting s because I did listen to Council as I was home and I didn't like some of the things that I was hearing . So tonight on the program it doesn't list the conduct of City Council . And that's a concern to me because I will be speaking about it in further meetings . Tonight , I want to talk about the homeless community . After being unable to attend Council for several weeks, I have been watching it on the ECTV which they do a great job. And I wanted to know the status of the homeless community . Since I had not heard of anything , I'm sure that myself as well as the city residents want to know what's going on with our homeless population . As the nights have gotten colder, most of us go to our wall and turn our thermostats up. Or we say, oh, I'm not going to turn it up tonight because I don't want my bill to go up and they get another blanket or they put on their flannel sheet on their bed. The homeless population don't have those choices . And I wanted to know about that. So I kept listening to see if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Council or if something was going to be in the papers about where the committee that was develop ed for the homeless committee and what the status was. I did not hear anything . So I always think about my church and we do a homeless project of sleeping bag project . And if anyone wants to know about that, they could Google that. And they'll see that we at our church meet once a month. And we make the sleeping bags for -- we take them down to Keystone Missions . And it's just a bunch of, you know, we're not all retired. And my job, I fill the needles because they really have to go through all those layers of material . So I fill the needles. And the other people go around this little table, something like this and make sleeping bags. We do about four or five a month. So previously I've asked about showers . And I was told that the homeless people could take a shower at Weston Field. You know, when you're home when you're doing things between your computer and Googling things and looking up articles in the paper and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 asking people -- I did find out that the city offers the missions shower coupons . They're $2.50. I mean, come on, do they really have to pay to take a shower? I know that water costs money. I know that whatever supplies they supply costs money. But $2.50, you know, seems like somewhere along the way that price can be absorbed . So then I started reading about the different things in the paper between Wilkes-Barre, Allentown . They're doing great jobs in other cities, but I don't see anything in the papers about Scranton . In Wilkes-Barre they've begun to renovate buildings to house the homeless . And Keystone Missions has a facility in Wilkes-Barre that houses overnight people. And if I recall, they give them evening meals, showers , and a place to sleep and breakfast the next morning . Headlines for Wilkes-Barre, Construction Begins on Permanent Homeless Shelter in Wilkes-Barre. The article goes onto list the address and what will be provide d at that facility . The new facility will provide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 stability and essential services for those in need. The new shelter will have space for 20 beds and will also feature showers and laundry facilities . Construction is expected to be completed at Thanksgiving before the cold weather sets in. The new shelter will be handicapped accessible . They also have a place Ruth's Place. I did see -- I was home and I saw the young lady come up to the podium. She was homeless . And she was concerned about her safety. In Wilkes-Barre they have a place called Ruth's Place. And it's a shelter for women that are experiencing homelessness . And they provide shelter for -- and they have been doing it for 20 years. Twenty years, I was surprised when I read that. And so I'm still again looking for things from Scranton . I'm looking for things from Scranton . I didn't see anything . I'm not sure if this young lady, how she made out if anybody was able to get her services or not. I don't know. So then, Dr. Rothchild , maybe you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 could address this in Fifth Order. We have talked about the number of homeless in the city, the list of facilities that are available so that I thought we were going to have a homeless czar or someone to oversee all the facilities in Scranton so that they could work together -- I'm sorry, I'm over my time. So anyway I stand here tonight , you know, just concerned and just to think when you go to bed at night and you're nice and comfy and warm, everybody doesn't have that opportunity . And I know I think about it. And I'm just very blessed that I can go to the wall and turn my thermostat up. But I can go to my chest and pull out another blanket . Everyone cannot do that. And this -- and I have to end this here, but for the grace of God go I. Now, I don't know if I could take a few more minutes for Doris Koloski ? MR. SMURL: We're already gone over. I'm sorry, Norma. Welcome back. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay, thank you. MR. SMURL: I don't know who signed the next one, Paul -- could it be Paul? Okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. NARCOONIS : Good evening , Councilmen and lady. My name is Paul Narcoonis , city of Scranton . Bear with me. I had a few strokes . I had to go walk up, no car, get the bus up there (inaudible ). I just tried to walk down for exercise . I saw 14 houses that were dilapidated , litter filled, junk, windows smashed, wires hanging down, cable. Come on, folks. I recommend the city go through every court and street in the neighborhood in the City of Scranton . I know it's a lot. They got these junk houses, rundown abandoned places that is littered , tons of litter blowing around. Come on, folks. On Wyoming Avenue there used to be a little bus -- bus stop -- bus shelter there. It was all torn up for a long time. And they sell paint now. People are parking there. They are getting free parking apparently . Buses have to stop there in the lane -- in the lane. That bus backs up, you have to around go around it. That causes congestion on Lackawanna Avenue. Can the city put a sign there for Colts that no parking , bus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 station only? That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Les Spindler . Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . Last time I was here I talked about people -- Scranton High School parking illegal ly picking up their kids where it says no parking , and they are still doing it. There's a bus stop there for one or two buses and past there you're not suppose d to park. There's no parking signs up there. And people are still parking they take up half the lane, half the traffic lane. That's -- I don't know if that's a police issue or if that's a parking enforcement issue. But it should be taken care of. Next thing, I was really disturbed last week when I heard Lackawanna County is a raising our taxes 33 percent . I mean, I know that has nothing do with City Council . I'm just hoping when the city budget comes before you, I hope there's no raise because we just can't take it. And there's a lot of people like me on Social Security . We don't get a 33 percent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 raise every year in our pay. It's ridiculous . If the city raises it, I don't know what. People are going to lose their houses. It's unbelievable . I know that the county is going to have some meeting s. Hopefully they'll listen to people. But you have some kind of solution , make cuts in people's salaries or whatever . But we can't take a big raise like that. Yesterday , second gentleman Doug Emhoff was here and the Mayor following him around like a little puppy dog. She never met a camera she didn't like. She should be here in the office doing her job and looking at the budget seeing what they could do so we don't get a tax hike. But there she was right on camera. Next thing, yesterday I was driving by the Houdini Museum on Main Avenue. And they have these long concrete blocks on the sidewalk so nobody parks there. Somehow one of them got pushed out into the street. It's not too far out. It's near the curb. But those things must weigh a couple hundred pounds. So it had to be a couple people must 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 have been doing mischief and picked it up and put it out on the street. And you could see it, but at night I don't know how good you could see it. If somebody hits that with their car, they're going to wreck their car. So I don't know if we could get that moved back to the sidewalk . I'm surprised the museum hasn't said something about it because I've seen it for the last two days. I don't know how long it's been out there. But that's a safety issue. Last week I was telling Chief Judge before he walked out, yesterday I'm coming down Green Ridge Street at 8:30 in the morning . At the corner of Green Ridge and Capouse there was a fairly good car accident . Both cars were really damaged . And there was a fire truck there, no police car yet, no ambulance . They already had that stuff spread down because there was liquid fluid on the street. I said, John, I said, my God, I drove away from there saying that was pretty impressive . Fire truck got out there and did their job before the police even got there or ambulance . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 So I said kudos to the Scranton Fire Department for doing a great job. He told me there was also an accident is the same corner last night. There's a traffic light there. I don't know what the problem is, probably not paying attention . Again, kudos to the Scranton Fire Department . They do a great job. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Les. Mr. Voldenberg , will you let the traffic division of the police department know about that concrete barrier in the road to see if it's them or if DPW could push it back? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Ron Ellman. Good evening , Council . I got this letter Saturday from 341 Washington asking me to vote for Harris. So evidently Washo{phonetic } doesn't watch this program or something . I don't know. These two, they got a complete blatant lie in here saying Mr. Trump -- they quote Mr. Trump wants to end the war. He hasn't made a statement like that. He has a -- he's joined the vehicle in Washington that knows there has to be some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 closure to this conflict . This war is going nowhere except bankrupting America , if you ask me. Our money can't -- we can't keep pouring it in there, which is what Harris promised . You know, this woman can't even have an intelligent interview without it being edited to her understanding on Fox last week. And this is somebody you people want to have elected . And a man made 30 trips paid by China and doesn't really explain them? Told his troops to go on two months before. You guys go to war, I'm staying here. He's a blatant coward.like I said last week. He's disgust ing to me. Harris's plan -- she could only go so far without the power behind the democrat ic party supporting her and there is a power. That's the power that fired Biden. He didn't want to quit. Who knows what would have happened if he stayed in there with all the money that's going to the -- from the democratic party. There's no way you could build 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 millions of new homes and give $25,000 to move in, give tax abatements so we could have a taco stand at every corner in America . And if it was possible , this administration would have it all for the illegals anyway. Yesterday 's paper -- television showed thousands more walking down here, no English speaking, criminal disease d people, every disease known by man they brought into this country the last few years. There's polio in New York State. There's diseases they don't want to talk about in the paper are overrunning young people. I have a friend in Detroit that was a retired college profess or. And he told me he believes the first thing illegals are going to start doing if they vote is take over school boards. Once that happens , America is gone. It will be worse than the college -- these misfits that teach in college . I got one real quick question . If you have to speak English and read English , write English to vote, what do we need interpreters for? You don't know what the interpreters are telling people. This is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 outrageous . If someone can't vote, they ought to bring their own interpreter or stay home. And I'd like to know what right they have to mail letters like this. It's a blatant lie in there. And they are using this bleeding heart approach from this tragedy going on in the Ukraine asking for votes. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Rik Little. Hi. I'm Rik Little from Scranton . It's very disturbing to me. It's always disturbing to me just watching the media and how they're doing. And when I saw that Kamala Harris said she worked at McDonald 's and then I see the proof from McDonald's that she never worked there, that's disturbing . And then people get upset when Donald Trump is working at McDonald 's. I read the Times-Tribune and saw that some big law firm is suing Tom Coyne over his discovery of personal materials out in the garbage . The committee has to be better than that. There's carrots and there's sticks. But the stick in this city and county law seems to be lawfare . And lawfare goes way up to the top. I mean, people -- yeah, they got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 everything going through the phones in the legal community . And, you know, people are talking about the homeless problem . The homeless problem starts with housing , Scranton Housing Authority . That has to be a communication between this body and the Mayor and the Board of Commissioners of Scranton Housing Authority because I have been going to the meetings . And it -- I mean, it just doesn't seem like democracy to me. You should have the minutes of that meeting immediately . They make you wait a month to get them. But this thing about, you know, instituting lawsuits , I mean, four years, the people from Scranton Housing Authority kept me busy. And this is after they took my stuff, locked it away. I called the police department . The police department says see the manager . And then when I get, you know, it -- it's a runaround. You know, there's enough resources to take care of everything . But it's just the deceit in how it's -- how they prosecute people. That's the stick. People -- old people can't -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 there's no lawyers to help them. There's no lawyers to help Tom Coyne and his thing. They get you into this mesh where they know every character . They're all part of their evidence . Like when I was in Scranton Housing Authority , they just put in all, you know, millions of dollars worth of surveillance cameras and then they take me to court and, you know, they could deny it, you know. The health and safety things that people are constructing , I'm always hearing about health and safety. It's only for the health and safety of the people that are running the government. It looks to me that way because it's not protecting . I mean, I had people breaking into my door all the time. And I was severe PTSD and my nerves were like that. And I'm doing a lawsuit to keep my kid in the family courts, which is a whole other malady of bad law. There has to be, I mean, how do all of these agencies have so much money to spend on lawyers ? I mean, like I said, a couple weeks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 ago that's the only business that is booming . But it's destroying the community . There should be a discussion , a discussion of how to do this. But around here it's like, you know, I do a right to know and the head of Lackawanna County throws me out of the building and tells the sheriff never come in here again for a request that I went to Matt Cartright's office and they told me, yeah, you need to fill out a right to know. It's too much, too much law, too much law. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer , taxes paid. Okay, let's get to it. Two weeks ago I made a comment that the Harrison Avenue bridges are cracking . And any crack in a concrete surface is going to get water in. So it doesn't matter how -- you don't have to turn it into a Manhattan project . But, please somebody get up there and put some grout into it and seal it up. MR. SMURL: Dave, last week I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 reported to everyone that the state was there. They had reinspect ed it. And they gave us a list of what their corrections are going to be. But they know about it and they were there. MR. DOBRZYN : Okay, that's great. Great. Recycling , it's time now that we go with two separate barrels for plastic bottles and glass and steel cans or aluminum cans. It would greatly reduce the chances that we're going to be hauling that up to the trash. It's kind of a shame how much you go through to even recycle it in the first place. Okay, East Mountain firehouse , I didn't have them in order here. I think it would be great to keep it right where it's at even if we had to get a little bit of land by eminent domain. And it is a lot easier to get down a hill than it is up an icy hill. And it could result in somebody maybe not making it out. It's important . And we already did put money into that building to repair roofs and stuff if I'm not mistaken . Now, on tourism , down at Steamtown we have a rail museum. I don't know how long ago but it was quite a while ago. The air 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 conditioning and heating broke down and some of their buildings are not open. And in 2014, we took all but one engine off the tracks and that was finished up maybe a year later or two. It's just the yard tender that you could take a little ride on. But there are no steam excursion s out of Scranton . But anyway, back maybe like 2010 I used to see six railroad cars. And you had to get on there and grab a seat because if you didn't, you were going to get the junkiest seat in the house. Somebody stole my seat one time. I came all the way back from Delaware Water Gap with a spring sticking in a place I didn't really appreciate . I felt like throwing him out the window, but being somewhat civilized I didn't. But after the election , I'll bring this up again and maybe I could collect a few more facts for you. That used to be a big playground for the wife and I. But I can't be exposed to people because of a whole bunch of personal conditions . So if I could open windows on a rail car, I just went out on excursion , great. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 if I'm cooped up on October 31st or whatever then, it's out, you know, too many people who are skeptical of vaccinations and stuff. And I don't need their maladies. Now, we're coming up on voting. And what I would advise everybody , be pragmatic . You better find out what Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , veterans care and a whole bunch of other things -- issues have that they're trying to phase it out with that 2025. So, I'm sorry, if Trump wins, you're liable to have 40 million people roaming around the country homeless and without anything to back up on. And it's just a shame. But actually , you know, if people don't familiarize themselves with what the issues are and they run out and vote on a bunch of junk that they heard off the television . Thank you and have a good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all for our sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I got here a little late today. I happened to go the county meeting on the 33 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 percent tax increase . And I'd like to say to the residents that when ECTV was created it was a public access channel and when the federal government created that law, that channel was created so the public could meet, have open discussions and try to push their government in a direction and bring elected officials in outside this format where you could actually have a conversation with somebody and get some answers . And if you remember the tax group, they bring people in running for office and ask questions . And that was the format that should have been followed . Now, Scranton has more than one public access channel . But where we find ourself today is that we've turned the public access channel into a propaganda channel for government . We don't need a propaganda channel . All right. We need a channel . And, you know, I say to the people in the neighborhood associations that have been begging for money from elected official s for the last 50 years and acting like lap dogs that maybe it's time to change, okay? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Maybe it's time to make demands because the people need access to a public access channel . Now, I didn't get into federal court yet and I've been trying for a little while. I don't think the judge really wants to hear the case. But it will be whatever it is. But the city government has abused its discretion by doing the things it's done with that channel which means the elected officials . Okay, when you look at what that channel was designed to do and what its purpose was and what's happened to it and what's happened to the 1.5, 1.6 million dollars the city is receiving franchise fee money and you take a look at what's happening in the county and the city, it's because the people have no voice. You know, the election is coming. I listened to a couple people come here today talking about the election that's coming up. There's an awful lot of disinformation . And I just hope that the American people vote strictly for Trump, okay, because all the make-believe stuff they've been talking about here has been covered in the press outside of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 America , there's no plans to cut Social Security . There is no -- Trump is not involved with 2025, okay. Harris is totally incompetent . And people who know her and people who were elected officials and judges have stated just how incompetent she is. And, you know, the American people will make up their own decisions on what they want to do. But what I have to say to the people is, look at the pain you're experiencing now from our local government , City Council , the County Commissioners . You know, it's just one stone of incompetent government stacked on another stone, okay? And then when you get down the road so far, you're so deep into quicksand that you don't even know you're there. Okay, I mean, when you take a look at the way government functions , the people need a change. They're demanding it. I say go out and vote. Hopefully everybody will vote for Trump, but vote as you please. As far as being an informed voter, don't count on the press or the media to tell you anything because it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 just a mess. And when you look at the way you're living your life, look at your government and look at the neighborhoods in the city. And you could tell that there's something wrong, vastly wrong. And when you take a look at your paycheck and see the amount of taxes you're paying and the amount of government debt, you should really know there is something wrong. And when you look at the educational system and children graduating from school that can't read and write, I mean, if that doesn't tell you -- it's not about democrats and republicans . It's about your standard of living. And in order to change that, you need a platform so you could communicate . And that's what ECTV was created for to give the ordinary people a platform to bring elected officials in and to bring change to their communities . But instead , politicians hijacked it and made it something like a propaganda channel like something Germany might have had or the North Korean's had. And that's why this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 country is falling apart. These are the people you elected . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Greeting , members of Council and the community . Council President , why do you require a name before we could speak at this podium? MR. SMURL: For the record. MR. COYNE: For the record, okay. But the city contends that a name is protect ed and it may cause embarrassment to someone so that's protected . So a partici pant being mandated exposes themselves in my case, the city puts forth in an argument that every time you ask the public for a name as a requirement from protective speech before this body, the speech offers them exposure and embarrass ment. In turn, by asking a name you are violating the privacy rights of every member at this podium. And you are individually liable as you proceed with knowledge and forethought . The argument is factually absurd, yet it's why I am here this evening . By this time, no doubt you're aware the City of Scranton is suing me. And I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 reasonably expect that one or two Council members or maybe the entire Council has gone into or will go into an executive session to circle the wagons. But four out of the five members of Council except for President Smurl, a super majority apologize d for the city conduct and declared that I did the right thing. So far as to invoke the mantra, you see something , you say something . But as our leader Mayor Cognetti , the warrior for justice and transparency has continually be it misconduct in the License and Inspection , the former director of OECD arrested while driving without a license or tossing the files of people's privacy at the curb has chosen to pick the path of you see something involved with the city, shut up. Don't rock the boat. Citizens deserve nothing . I did not -- it was not explained well in the Times as the reporter did not have the material available . But the anti-staff law was put in place because a government or entity should not be able to litigate people into silence and weaponize it to stop speech.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 They have staff lawyers , hired outside firms and have an unlimited budget unlike the citizens . These are not my direct words. I choose to use them. The city decided to sue a modern day use of the truncheon . And I reply because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation , words will retain power. Words offer the means to meaning , and for those who listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is there is something terribly wrong in this city, isn't there? Words offered by the citizen s are sometime s that enunciation of truth. Someone would say be quiet, save it for the court and not the court of public opinion . But the public opinion , an informed public will direct those who may listen to vote and will term how the city is run after the next election cycle. The administration tainted the well by starting out with a truncheon . But there are members of Council I would agree to act as mediation . But silence is all the city desires . The simple truth is when an administration refuses to provide any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 information the public requested including Joan, their hand had to be enforced at my peril. All I would have asked was a statement under oath that all parties exposed were notified of the breach and it would have been done. I took photos because I knew without them the city would be likely to say they were boxes of old menus and other items. And since I had proof, they were forced to confront the truth. I'm sure if anyone now asks they will be told the issue is under litigation and it can't be discuss ed. How convenient . I'm still open to mediation . And as the road may be long, I am ready for the trip. Thank you and good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tom, great job tonight . Nobody has to be singled out for wanting to do the right thing. The majority of this Council said that he did the right thing. When you have public information from employees , former employee s that sit out there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 for five hours and he did the right thing to do the best he can with the help of Dr. Rothchild , he should be commended for that, not served, not having to go into court. He wants to know what the importance is and to get answers as far as the protection of those employees . You know, when identity theft is on the rise on a yearly basis, it's important that we secure those files and do the right thing. Tom Coyne did the right thing. And he's being sort of punished for it like a slap on the wrist. Well, my opinion is completely wrong and so is this administration . I'm going to talk about the elephant s in the room here. You know, we went through more calls over the weekend . Our police department takes six calls an hour, 137 a day, 50,000 a year. They need to be safe upon doing so. These calls are more extreme . They're more severe. And I think that we need to address this problem head on. You know, something else head on was the Chief's son's truck into a tree. You know, I have a few questions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 there. How did he get home? Why was he there at 4 in the morning ? And if he hit a tree, was he charged with anything ? You know, when you become a police officer you have to hold yourself to higher standard s in order to hold the public to higher standard s. Hopefully somebody here on this Council would address that. I stand before you a humbled man who really cares about the city and its direction . This isn't a direction that I anticipated . It's not a direction that I foresee. We had a meeting with a crime watch on Thursday night. And one of the issues we addressed was local housing and it was the West Side Hotel. And the day after, they found somebody deceased . You know, when we put a bunch of people from drug court, adult probation , adult parole in one place, it's not a good climate for them. And the calls are becoming more extreme there. And I hope it could actually get addressed . It's alarming to know that from this day and age our children cannot go to school without being worried about crossing the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 street. We still don't have crosswalks for our children . You know, when we have crosswalks it's easier for people to get around. The police officers could actually make stops if they are going through the intersection . It slows people down. And, you know, when there's more accident s because we don't have this safety measure in place, it becomes an issue because a lot of times these officers have to go out three or four and just even direct traffic . The easiest way to get an individual is with a traffic stop as opposed to being there and having to direct traffic . You know, we're looking at all of these issues but we're looking at them the wrong way. I think that we could actually do better with so many things. I feel that this isn't the direction that we need to be in. And, Dr. Rothchild , last week I mentioned about not being from the area. You know, it's one thing to make poor decisions coming from out of town, but personally I've sent stuff to you on a personal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 leave for your community and you really address ed them immediately . You know, there's right ways to do things. There's wrong ways to do things. And I would like to thank you for doing the right thing. I hope that throughout the rest of the year we continue to do the right thing because together come next year, change is coming. Thanks. Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments . I want to thank Chief Judge for being here this evening , Dr. Hinkley and I can't remember the other gentleman 's name from Fitch and Associates . Mr. Knight from Fitch and Associates . It's obvious there was a tremendous amount of time and effort that went into this feasibility study. It appears as though it was done extremely well. There will be a lot of hard questions asked. Ultimately , I hope that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 we could arrive at a solution that will benefit the city as a whole and allow us to make sure that we're protecting the health, safety, and welfare of all of our residents but still maintain , be fiscally sound. So it's a balancing act. This is -- we can't be making knee jerk decision s. So we need to really sit down at the table and learn as much as we can before an ultimate decision is made on this important topic. So I want to thank these three gentlemen for being here tonight . Unfortunately , we only had 45 minutes . We probably could have spent three and a half hours discussing that. So that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I have a few comments . One thing, this Thursday the 24th at 6 p.m. at the Keyser Valley Community Center, there's going to be a meeting on the Keyser Valley stormwater. So I encourage residents that are interest ed in that topic to come out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 to that meeting to be informed on that. I did get an update. We had an address over on Dickens Street for a repair there. There was a one call that came out, the ground was marked. But what I'm being told is that they're waiting for the North Scranton Tripp Park stormwater project to begin to fix that. And that was the update I've received last on that address on Dickens Street. A few weeks ago we talked about 902 West Elm Street. There was a basin there that needed replacement. When getting into that work, the water company found that 165 feet of damaged line needed to be repaired. So that is going to be repaired and also the 2600 block of Washburn Street, there's about 150 feet of pipe that's going to be repaired in that area as well. Last week I got a few calls about refuse collection in West Scranton around the All Saints area. Mr. Voldenberg , I'm going to ask if you could reach out to the administration or our new DPW Director , see if there is any kind of possible changes that occurred with the DPW refuse collection .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 The garbage trucks in and around the school at arrival time are intermingled in the traffic and it's rough for the cars to get in and out. And it's something that I haven't heard in several years that has been an issue. But it seems to be an issue in the last two or three weeks. I waited this week to see if it was the same. And I got those messages from individuals that this week it was also an issue there that I don't know if the timing needs to be adjusted for school arrival . But it seems to be something that's becoming an issue there in and around that school. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. While I'm on that, is it possible to ask for an update on Rubicon if we plan on rolling out this system, any kind of an update as to it if it's going to be implemented as the contract does end in December of 2024. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And if we could just clarify that end date. So according 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 to our paperwork it's December , 2024. But could we just clarify that that is the end of that contract ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. And, Mr. Smurl, that's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. First, just also wanted to comment on what we heard tonight about the EMS feasibility study. So I do appreciate Chief Judge and the others coming in to explain their study findings . I do wish we had more time for the findings as well because I'm really interested in and will be looking careful ly at the PowerPoint and information that was provided to us. But I think we will have a lot of followup questions . It is important that we have the discussion and find out if it is feasible or not. But, yeah, I still don't stand anywhere specifically because I think there's a lot more to know about this topic. I also wanted to mention something I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 had asked about last week the HUP test. I'm not sure if I missed this response at some point but I think at the end of September they did provide us with an update. So I'm just going to repeat it in case others had missed it too. But with regards to the HUP test, the issue still on this project is a lack of support document ation at the Lackawanna County Assessor 's office for nonprofits which is I think about 158 properties , collection of this documentation is an Assessor 's Office responsibility . The city had a meeting with Lackawanna County and the Scranton School District on September 4th to determine how the Assessor 's office will collect this information . And the Assessor 's Office is drafting a letter to be included with the mailings to nonprofit property owners as part of all the assessment mailings to city property owners. So that is still where we stand on the HUP test. And then to respond to Miss Jeffries and her question regarding the unsheltered and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 homeless population within Scranton , I haven't received any additional updates . Last I was told that there was going to be a meeting taking place I think a few weeks ago. But that was when I asked about it. And I didn't ever receive a time, a place, a formal invite. And then others who I know who were also suppose d to be part of that task force did not receive anything . So I'm not sure if that meeting took place. I haven't gotten anything and I've asked for meeting minutes in the past. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could please contact the Mayor and her administration if a meeting did take place if I could receive an update or Council could so that we could relay that to the public. And I definitely understand the concern s and the urgency with colder weather impending and, you know, how that will affect this population and what steps will be taken as a city. I know we're looking into a few different options. But like I said, unfortunately I don't have any further information on where we're with that. But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 will make sure you get it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So again, I'm in agreement . Thank you, Chief Judge, Fitch and Associates for coming with their presentation tonight but continue d dialogue needs to occur and take in all considerations with regards , you know, health, safety, and welfare and the needs and interest of every party involved . So that's going to require a lot of dialogue , I believe . On 1203-1205 Euclid Avenue, there's a curb that needs to be put back, all right, and this gentleman reached out to me and said it's been paved twice and promised twice to put the curb back because every time it rains -- he sent me a picture , Mr. Voldenberg , that I will send to you -- his whole front yard is washed out. So we need to have the department s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 involve d to take a look at that and let's check into that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : Also, a stop street -- street and stop signs on Rock Street and Hyde Park Avenue, I guess there was a new power line install ed. They sent me a picture . It looks like the stop sign is 12 feet high and it's no longer visible . And I think the old pole remains. This has been an issue that Mr. Schuster has been bringing up as long as I'm here about when they replaced the power pole or the power lines, they leave the old pole there. It looks terrible and it's definitely -- it's definitely , you know, a line of sight issue without actually seeing the stop sign and street signs themselves . So let's please take a look at that if you could send that over. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Back in July and then again this September or previous September , I received concern s about Kearney Court. And this is behind the Penalty Box. And it's between the 3200 block Pittston and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 the 3200 block of Greenwood. It's the last block before Moosic so it's not from Moosic. What was requested and, you know, this gentleman I remember him saying he went through protocol . He went through 311, got no response . And he came to me and I remember bringing it up. And all he wanted because he sent picture s -- I don't know if you remember , Mr. Voldenberg . I know you took care of it for me. The watch children signs are fading and it's a very busy court. All he asked which is a reasonable ask is some new watch children signs in that court. So it's July, August, September . It still hasn't been done. If you could please check, you know, the status of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And also so, 1138 Eynon Street next to Willard School, there's a lot there that has been brought up all summer. And I brought it up maybe twice, once before we went on break, maybe once after. I'm not sure but the gentleman who reaches out to me all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 time and this is a yearly thing. It's not been touched . They haven't done anything . And also right up the street that hole that a lot of people were talking about near Hampton, on Hampton with the barricades , it's still, you know, a safety issue. The barricade s are actually knocked down now. So that safety issue remains with that hole and, you know, there's a lot of kids between Willard and the high school. So if we could please get a final status on that. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . This is a followup from code enforcement since our last council meeting on a request that were sent in. They have since last week towed 24 vehicles , issued nine quality of life tickets and 10 vehicles removed were actually removed by the homeowner s themselves when code enforcement went and spoke with them. Thirty-seven other vehicle s were tagged again this week. And then this past Friday the motor home that was in a yard at 200 Prospect Avenue, that was also removed . And a vehicle that we got a complaint 630 Cherry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Street, that was removed by the Scranton Police Department and another one on 540 Alder Street. That was also towed. So thank you to the Scranton Police and Traffic Division and the Code Enforcement Department . That's it, Mr. McAndrew or I'm sorry, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

I think this is going to be money well spent, especially in light of some of the issues that we've been having in the city in terms of, you know, gang activity . And just as far as covering health, safety, and welfare , if we have cameras there, they tend to be a deterrent because nobody wants to be on candid camera because it makes it that much easier for them to get snagged when they are doing things they shouldn 't be doing. So I think this is a good idea. MR. SMURL: Thank you. And also, those cameras I believe they're going to be at Connell Park. And I believe there is internet service up in that park now and it will be back down to the police department like the other cameras . All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR.
