SCRANTON WASTEWATER SEWER REPLACEMENT AND REHABILITATION PROJECT LISTING RECEIVED JUNE 3, 2022 FROM PENNSYLVANIA AMERICAN WATER COMPANY . 3-F. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM OECD DIRECTOR REGARDING CITY OF SCRANTON ’S GRANT LIST 2020-2022. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? MR. SCHUSTER : I have comment s for two of these items. First, I'd like to discuss the pool proposal that I now had more than a few minutes to review. I reached out to some local architect s and engineers . I got a few numbers just to get their perspective on this plan that was present ed last week. One thing I would like to say is the plan that we were presented seems to be about a million dollars over -- a million dollars inflated . I'm going to start with some of the most egregious line items that I noticed and identified here. About 10 of the 15 were overbudgeted. First off, the pool line item. In the proposal it was stated at about 250 per 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 square foot. This seems to be about $50 more per square foot. Next line item was utilities . So keep in mind that this site already exists. There's already gas. There's already water. There's already electric . There's already sewer. This line item was 400 to $425,000. Again, this site already exists. It seemed to be the price for a facility that was more than a mile away from utility hookups. Also, prior to utilities we had the restroom and bathhouse, which some of these utilities would also be include d in that line item. So these two line items are inflated . Next we look at the closest area. The closet area, they're charging about $12 per square foot which should be around nine. Next line item, synthetic turf. The cost of the synthetic turf per square 1,000 square feet is $246,000 as opposed to $30,000 for one 1,000 square feet of lawn. So with this line item here, it's a no-brainer . We should be looking to do this with lawn. I mean, decisions like this are why we get into distress ed status. Landscaping total was high. They figured it was about $30,000 too high. Top 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 soil, the number here seems to be about right. But it depends on the depth of the top soil. So we will have to get some more information on them. Fencing , I don't know. I'd have to go up and take a look at the fencing . But there might be some section s of the fence that are in use. I don't know. I just figured I would ask at this point in time. Site amenities , this line item here, I'm not really sure what it is. I think we need a lot of explanation . It's very vague. And keep in mind it's $250,000 for the line item. Next one, administration and permits . This line item is at $175,000. I'm very surpris ed that the City doesn't waive its own permits . I don't understand why we would move one piece of our budget from one place to another . It doesn't seem to make sense. The contingency , the contingency here is set at 20 percent . We got an original plan about one and a half years ago to two years ago. The contingency at that point in time was 10 percent . 10 percent is more than industry standard although it is on the high side. But if you look at this, this 20 percent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 it's about a million dollars in contingencies . We should be looking to get into contracts with people that aren't going to change. We're not going to see any change orders coming in. The budget should be tight on these project s. If we were to sustain a million dollar contingency piece, we would need an itemized list of the accounting of what this actually means, what it is being used for, and we should have zero change orders. Last line item, design engineering , first off, because it's the same site it should run about 3 percent to 5 percent . This is the industry standard and actually be all inclusive from start to finish. This proposal sets the design engineering at 15 percent which is three times the industry standard . The design we were presented with last week is a 3 foot deep pool. I think we all decided that we could probably scale back the splash pad. We'd like a more traditional design. And the last thing I'm going to speak about here with the Nay Aug pool is the bathhouse . So from the study that we received a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 year and a half ago from two firms MKSD, they stated the existing bathhouse is approximately 1500 square feet and consists of lobby space, men's and women's toilet rooms and two lifeguard storage spaces. The committee informed us that this layout does not meet the needs of the park guests because it lacks locker room and changing areas, which keep in mind the bathrooms can be dually used as changing areas and places to gather during periods of inclement weather and administrative office space and meeting and party rooms. This building was built in 2003, 2004. I do think we do need to take another look at this bathhouse to see what we can do with it. I don't think razing the existing bathhouse might be in our best interest . I think we do need to take another look at this. So as I said last week as I think we all agree, I would like to see a more traditional pool. I'd like to see a scale back of the splash pad. I'd like to take another look at the bathhouse. And when we talked -- when we spoke about funding , the funding was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 about a million dollars off. And these proposals that we have seem to be about a million dollars inflated. Onto my next item, 3-D. We received correspondence from the City's HR Director and one of the position s on there is now considered nonexempt. So, Frank, can you please send correspondence to HR and inquire why the safety and recycle coordinator is now considered a nonexempt position for overtime ? Back in March I did request a clarification on nonexempt and exempt positions . And on March 1st, we did receive word from the HR Department that this position was a nonexempt position . Last year, if I'm going off from memory, the DPW administration overtime was about 706 percent over budget. One of those positions was moved into a different department . It seems like the overtime has come down and now we are moving one of the exempt positions into nonexempt. So if we could get correspondence to HR and inquire as to -- if we could clarify why this is. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MS. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That is all. MR. DONAHUE : Any other Council members have any comment on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do. This past Saturday the pride flag was put up in front of City Hall which was a great event. It was great to have everyone in attendance there. And I just want to say happy Pride Month. And the other announce ment that I had in reference to 5-B for Juneteenth, I just want to make the public aware there will be a Juneteenth celebration that Black Scranton Project is hosting at their building on 1902 North Main Avenue. And that will be Sunday, June 19th from 12 to 5 p.m. And it's an outdoor event. That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Do any other Council members have any announcements ? MR. KING: Just quickly , once again I want to thank the City and DPW for the work that was done on Mount Lake Road. All of our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 shocks are now saved, our tires. That was so long overdue. And then it was a job well done. They fixed all the infrastructure and the drainage . So kudos to DPW on a job well done on the paving project on East Mountain . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Any other Council members have any announcements ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. I want to commend Mr. Schuster on his comparison analysis from last week's presentation in Third Order. Thanks. Good job. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else with any announcements ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joseph Albert. MR. ALBERT: Thank you. It's unfortunate that the taxpayers , citizens , and residents don't care enough about what goes on in this City that they fail to attend Council meetings . And I apologize . I'm one of them also. But there was an interesting story from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 your last meeting about giving away a city street to a private enterprise so they could attempt to make a profit and do things better. I'm talking about Center Court off of Adams Avenue and Washington Avenue that connects both streets , which are one way which is on your agenda to give away to a private operation . I vehemently and adamantly oppose it and recommend that you, if possible , table this action for further study. The last time something from the taxpayers was given away, it cost this city over $100,000 a year in taxes. And I'm referring to the Globe Store, which the Chamber of Commerce owned, gave it to the county and took it off the City tax rolls. And now you want to take a public street, close it off and give it to a private individual so they could have a park and do a better business . Again, I ask that you table this ordinance and resolution for further study. Thank you very much. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 And a couple of things I want to say today. I just learned since I came here tonight -- and, Councilman Schuster , I appreciate the detail that you gave on the pool tonight . I was aware of what you were talking about because I have those slides. But I kept thinking what about the public? They have no idea what you're talking about. They're just hearing words. It would be so great -- I mean, you have your laptop there that you could work with ECTV and get it up on the screen so that you could use pointers as you went down those and you could show the public what you're talking about. I knew what you were talking about and I appreciate everything that you said tonight , agreed with a lot of it, you know, because I've been at those meeting s. But that's just me. And I even don't know other people out here in the audience tonight whether they know exactly what you were talking about tonight . So just something to think about going forward . Use our technology . You have your laptop. And all you have to do is put it up on the screen so that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 people could see what you're talking about. So that was my little thing for tonight . The things that I have on my list was, I've been trying to get in touch with the IT Department because on August the 6th, we're having the Electric City Flower Show. And I want that up on the City website . I looked there, got the food things about the Greek festival is coming and all the other things. I want this up on there. I called them twice and left my name and my number. Nobody bothered to call me back. Let me know what I need to do because it's going to be August the 6th. I want it up at least by July 1st so we have the whole month of July. I'm going to be talking with ECTV as well. I want our slide up on the TV. We want to try to get as much publication . This is a first for the City of Scranton to have an Electric City Flower Show. So help me get in touch with IT so that they could tell me what to do and how to get that information up on the screen. The second thing I wanted to say and, Councilman King, you brought it up before. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 The job that the DPW did up on the mountain is fantastic . I go up and visit an elderly friend up there that is 97 years old. And I try to get up there once a week or every other week. And, you know, she's on Yesu Drive. So, of course, she got the paving was wonderful . And the culvert that they put in to keep that water from going over the road and tearing up that road is excellent . So my kudos as well to the DPW for the great work that they did up there. And they were so gracious to me because the one day I came up and they were busy working, working , asked me where I want to go. And I told them. They said, come on and, you know, they directed me down around all their equipment and everything . And I got to visit her. So I thank them for that as well. Another thing about the streets and that's Gibson and Clay Avenue. I don't know what the issue is there. But it's like you have to slow down to like zero miles because it drops off. And then they paved a little bit and then it goes up again. And I think it goes all the way down Clay Avenue. I don't know who did the work or whether it was gas, electric or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 whoever but it is a very, very disturb ing -- MR. DONAHUE : I think that restoration project is in progress . And I think they said in the middle of July that would be completely done all the way down Clay, up -- what is it Vine, North Webster I believe . And then it goes down North Webster . But it was a water project . But the whole restoration I think should be done relatively soon. They milled it. So they just have to come and pave it now. MS. JEFFRIES : Because it's, you know, you come up that hill and you forget that you're at Clay Avenue, you know, because you can't really see. Okay, that's my other thing. And then I've asked about this intersection before -- I got to hurry up, Clay and Vine Street. No parking needs to there. Someone is going to get broadsided by that intersection . And I mentioned it time and time again because it needs a no parking sign there. That's just that one. And then the other thing that I have that I wanted to concur with Mr. Albert, was it, that spoke about Center Street.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 I read that as well. And I have been down that street because they did a walkability . And I went on it with Wayne Evans. And it's a wonderful street. It really is and could be so much possibility . But my thing was, where am I going to park when I go down there? MR. DONAHUE : So it's only a small section of the road. I could address it in Fifth Order. But it's only a small section . And it's not being given -- I mean, there's the parking garage right next door. But it's for more community events. MS. JEFFRIES : Yes, but I just feel it's for the Center City resident s and not residents like me that don't live in Center City. Because if I'm going down there, I'm going to be driving . And it's going to be after 5:00 so that I have to find parking on the street and walk in. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, or there's the Casey garage that's right next door. MS. JEFFRIES : Is that free? MR. DONAHUE : No, it's not, no. MS. JEFFRIES : And I'm putting all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 my money into my gas tank now a days. Okay, thank you so much. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . First off, for all of my hate-filled radical associates that can't wait for Mr. Smiers{phonetic } to dictate their next agenda. I want them to take off their blinders for a few minutes and look up on their computers a documentary that's being shown by an Indian journalist named of Demesh Desusi, D-E-M-E-S-H, D-E-S-U-S-I. It's called 2000 mules. They're the ones that do all the work. This man was put in jail by Biden to shut him up and stop him. That's why it took so long to get this documentary out and on television and in the movies, I guess. It shows Biden's goal seems to be to control America ns from top to bottom. Look this up, 2000 mules. It's something to see because it's there. It's not all of this misinformation that everybody is says is out. You could see facts right there. Next, is I want to talk real quick about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Geisinger seems to be deliberately stalling purposely for some reason. You know, they knew a couple years ago they were going to buy the property . They know what they're doing. It's time for somebody to do something to let them explain to the City their actions . Let's just assume these 24 properties paid two thousand dollars in taxes. Are they going to assume the taxes until they decide to do something ? And when the new buildings , will they be taxed fairly in a couple years, two, three years from now because I really doubt it. Everybody I've talked to doubts it. It will be a whitewash . You know, it brings to mind I forgot what year, like, 15 years ago when Lackawanna College bought that little building . They knew right then and there they were going to be like a big octopus and take everything around it off the tax rolls. And that's what happened. Now it's happening with Geisinger 's. The City needs to just do something to protect the taxpayers . I talked to a man a couple weeks ago 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 when last week he applied for housing with the City. He can't afford it anymore. He put a roof on the house he has now. He says he can't sell it so he's going to abandon it. It's a HUD house. And the other person -- a couple has the same thing. They have reverse mortgage for years. They owe far more than the house is worth. And they applied for housing . People could see the handwriting on the wall. You know, Jerry and Debbie seem to want to cleanse the City of these people. There's no doubt about it. The low income, the minorities , they are the first ones that will be affected by the -- like I said two weeks ago, I'm paying over a thousand dollars more for utilities . So are you guys. And so are these people. Everybody is because of Wolf. I don't like Oz. And I'm not going to vote for him I don't think. I like Fetterman better. I'm an Independent , remember . But I got a fear of Fetterman following Wolf's policies and agendas he's there so long. The same with Shapiro . Pennsylvania is a very important state right now. It's more important than most 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 of the people that live here know. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next on the list is Derek Raines. MR. RAINES: It will take me a second to get in the proper position . MR. DONAHUE : Take your time. MR. RAINES: Ready? Can I have my five minutes? I can't see the timer so if anybody would like to tell me when I'm at 4 minutes or 5 minutes or close. My name is Derek Raines. I live at 919 Monroe Avenue. I used to come to this a lot back in the day with my good friend Eddie Pisano and the other people in the old neighborhood . I was on the board of director s for the Hill Neighbor Association for many years with my good friend Ozzie Quinn. We did a lot of good things for the Hill Association . But now I'm having problems . So now I'm here. I'm here for a couple different reasons . Number one is handicap accessibility in the City of Scranton does not comply with the American s with Disability Act. You cannot take a 36 inch chair up the ramp in the back of this building . I mean, it just barely fits. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 We need to have somebody like our physical therapist person here who should be qualified in the ADA and say, oh, you know what, that pathway needs to be wider. That's something that needs to be done. And it's -- the American s with Disability Act I could complain to the Department of Justice about the issues that I have and they could withhold funding to the City of Scranton . Does it happen, I don't know. But that is a process of me not being able to rectify my issue. My big issue now is 919 Monroe -- 900 block of Monroe between Myrtle Street and Ash Street. It rains, the water comes. The City allowed the water company to take a storm drain out of the middle of the block which happened to be right in front of one of our prominent judge's house. And if he still lived there that problem would be solved. So what happens now, it rains. All the water just comes. All the water coming down Myrtle Street, Ash Street. It's all there and it all ends up going to the front of my driveway where my apron is to get into my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 driveway . I have a handicap van. In the wintertime I can't drive through 3 feet of snow that is sitting there because there is no where for this water to go. The water it stays there all the time. There's water in front of my 918 Monroe. It will stay there until it turns to mud and just becomes a mess. We had David DeCosmo came out, did a great story on it. Nothing was done. It's just -- it is so disheartening to live in such a beautiful house in a city that really does not care about the people. I have sent photos. I have sent letters to the Mayor and our former physical therapist when she was still on Facebook . I've asked her to come by my house sometime . Nobody ever comes over. I do -- Mr. McAndrew it does at least answer some of my e-mails which maybe, maybe not. He may not be able to help me. But at least it gives me that satisfaction that somebody is listening. The last message I mailed to the Mayor's office about all of these pictures -- did my wife give you those pictures ? My wife Jill is going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 bring up my photographs that you can peruse through . This is my wife jill, a City of Scranton resident all of her life until we moved all over the United States, a wonderful woman. And I'm happy to have her. So I lost my whole train of thought -- oh, the roads and the water in front of my apron in front of the thing. So what happened was, there's a big huge storm drain there. And all the City knows -- and I will testify in front of every one of you. You will not find a cleaner center of the road than mine. They never clean the edges because nobody knows when they are ever going to sweep. The amount of debris and garbage that's along the curb -- and that's another thing. They ripped out all the curbs when they did the stormwater thing. They never fixed any of that. Now, all of that garbage and literally garbage is all there. I called DPW, stuff to the Mayor -- the Mayor -- the 311 thing, the lady said, oh, why don't I go over and take pictures of all the houses and get the addresses and stuff. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 I said to her, I'm disabled . I'm a disabled veteran . I cannot go policing the houses. We should have residents who are protect ed by our LIPS people. They should be going around and saying, oh, you know what, here's a car that sat here for a year and a half. Why don't we do something about it? Nope. Not going to happen. You go down my street and you see that gravel and gravel. You go from my house, one of my favorite places to go is to Zuppos down on Ash Street. I'll ride down to there in my chair, which my chair Price is Right rules. Anybody want to take a guess? No, 27 -- $37,000 for this chair. And I have to drive it down the middle of the street because there is no accessibility in this City for disabled people. It just is awful. I cannot go to Moses Taylor three blocks from my house. The only way I could get there is drive right down the middle of the road. Well, sometimes the people honk. It's just unbelievable . The City needs to look about walking , why don't they look at walking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 in the neighborhood ? Why don't they go around and say oh, you know what, these sidewalk s are horrible . What they did at my grandma's house at Muncie, Indiana , they said, you need new sidewalks replaced . We're going to replace them and we're going to add the payment to your taxes. That was something that was just done. So back to the garbage in the alley, these people -- when I say these people, I don't know who the people are. They drive down in the night and they just say, oh, you know what, I have a couch. Why don't I just get rid of this couch. The garbage men take it. So I'm going to put it in that new building that Geisinger and the City -- whatever , I can't think of the agency built a beautiful house right behind us. But people just seem to -- oh, it's empty. Let me throw my TV there. Let me throw my couch there and -- MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Raines. MR. RAINES: How much time do I have left? MR. DONAHUE : I'm sorry, but we'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 send DPW out and then also LIPS out in the alley behind your house in the 900 block. MR. RAINES: 900 block on the -- MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MS. RAINES: Can I add one quick thing? They did come out and look at our road, someone from the City. And he said the big problem with that road is it's never been graded. So the center of the road is so much higher. He said that's the main problem with our water runoff. Nothing goes down the road. It goes in because of the grading of the street. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Okay. When was the last time they were -- when were they out? MS. RAINES: He was just out a couple months ago. He come out and talked to us. And he looked at everything and he just said that -- the biggest problem is they keep paving without grading . And it just gotten so out of hand that -- I mean, I just lost $2,000 worth of landscaping in my backyard because of the water. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. All right. We'll have them look. We'll see if they came 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 up with anything and see if we can get an answer on that. And we'll also send Licensing and Inspection out to the alley -- MR. RAINES: And to add, we do have a physical therapist who is here who knows the American with Disability Act and she should be able to say -- MR. DONAHUE : So we have had conversation s about the ramp in the back. MR. RAINES: Great. Excellent . MR. DONAHUE : And it's not -- you know, I wish it was something we can -- MR. RAINES: There is no easy fix. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. MR. RAINES: No easy fix. MR. DONAHUE : And when we do do pavings , new pavings on the City end and also in both City projects , they do try to upgrade the corners to be accessible . You know, again, that's not something that will happen overnight . But as the City paves -- those are City paving projects . I don't know if -- I'll look into if we make -- I don't think we require the utilities with their paving project s to do new ones that don't exist 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 already . MR. RAINES: The one by my house is also a school bus stop and we have nine disabled people on my block who cannot walk. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I know the City does -- you know, with new paving project s, they do put in ADA accessibility . So I know it's not, you know, it's not an easy fix. MR. RAINES: And I'm going to tell you on a positive note because I'm leaving just to end on a positive note, I did -- I asked about how (inaudible .) MR. DONAHUE : Good to hear. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : And, Derek, your most recent picture s and issues I forwarded to Mr. Voldenberg I think it was Monday or Tuesday . So he's on it. MR. RAINES: And thank you to all the people that come here and say their things. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. Tonight I'm going to start off by giving a phone number. That number is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 570-558-1648. That is a telephone phone number with an answering machine on it. I think it's time to get started on the Home Rule Charter in this City and start talking about making revisions to the city government and way things are done here in this community and hopefully people will start with that. And the next thing up will be a web page. And we have a lot of problems in this City. And we have to face the reality . This isn't a shot at any one person in general . But this City's been spinning backwards for almost my entire lifetime and people deserve much more, a better government, a more receptive government and they deserve a City that's growing and works for its citizens . And I just really don't feel that exists. Mr. Schuster , you know, I agree with what you talked about today. And I'm glad you took enough time to review the things you did. But we've got to start reviewing everything . Now, I'd like to say that when I was a young man in my 20s, myself and a group of Scrantonians went to school to learn to do curbs and sidewalks .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 The federal government paid us. And the City itself eliminate d the program . So when you could see that -- the City really has played fast and loose with politics . But it's never really done anything for its citizens because all of these people now are retired and dead. And this City could have brand new curb and sidewalks throughout the whole City. And my father was a master carpenter . So there's not much I don't know how to do. We all spent our time to go to school to learn mixes and to put curbs in and catch basins and everything . The City could have just really had something really going for itself. But we played politics for too long. And maybe the people tonight will be listening to the phone number I gave them and they could find it on YouTube 570-558-1648. And let's do something for our City and let's not scapegoat people. And the other thing I want to say is that I'm really disappoint ed and like I said before, I think the president we have now is the worst president we've had in our history 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 even though they are trying to compare him to Buchanan who was a gateway president to the Civil War. But I think he's worse than him. You know, we keep talking about the guns. And, you know something , guns are a tool. It depends whose hand they're in. But the one thing we're not talking about in this country is how our children are raised because psychologists and people who have studied it are terrified about what's happening in America , fatherless families in massive numbers and what happens to male children and females to some degree that don't have a father. And the system that's created it all goes all the way back to Johnson and forward . You know, one time I remember when I was a kid, you know, the kids would laugh and say that the black kids didn't know who their father was. They thought it was a joke, it was funny. I'm not saying it in a racist note. It's just the way it was. Now, there is just so many people, they have no idea who their father is. They're running around. And of the last 18 of the last 20 shooters had no father. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 And we're talking about the gun. We've got to talk about society . We've got to talk about 62 million Americans aborted. We've got to talk about a culture of death and destruction that we've created in our own country that politics has created . We've got to ask ourselves, where are the playground program s and the youth program s and the mentoring program s? We're moving mountains and massive amounts of debts for project s and we're not investing anything in our children , even in their schools . Why isn't there a uniform funding act in Pennsylvania to bring all schools on the same plateau . Question that. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . I'd like to make a mention as long as we're of roads of Mattes Avenue down by General Dynamics or the old Chamberlain . That's been a mess or a year or two. MR. DONAHUE : That's suppose d to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 restored sometime soon. MR. DOBRZYN : Great. Great, hopefully . With that pool, I mentioned it once before, that bathhouse is not a legal bathhouse. So I would say it's a reasonably new building . Let's not tear it down. But let's consider weaning it out because it would be quite plain and simple. I was doing a number whiz and there was a kid getting dressed about a foot away from me during a kids swim free event. It's not really a bathhouse. It's not acceptable as a bathhouse. And it's reasonably new. So it could be an entrance or something and then people could drift off to the bathhouse. That would be great. Last week I mentioned about feeding cats. Now under Courtright administration we had street cats. And you could catch them and take them up to the zoo -- former zoo at Nay Aug and get them neutered . And some people have complain ed. I mean, I have one kitty cat who lives on the back porch. I couldn't pick him up even in the coldest weather and take him in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 the house. He won't come near me for two or three weeks after that. He still runs from me. I tried maybe in January . And, you know, he doesn't bother anything . And most of his territory is in the immediate neighborhood . But they were suppose d to be left alone by animal control . And it's like I said, some people sometimes have a legitimate complaint and some people just complain . I went through 15 cats that I neutered and some are no longer around. And it did stop neighborhood -- fifteen feral cats around the neighborhood is a pretty serious problem actually . With the hospital , it was mentioned and I will mention it once again. We really need a program where the state comes in and compensates . It's their constitution that you have to accept tax exempt buildings no matter what they're for. And, you know, the government building or hospitals . I won't complain about Geisinger because I was there last week for the day. So we really need compensation from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 the state. We can't say please go away. We need them. But the institutions serve people around the whole northeastern part of the state. And a lot of rural hospitals have been closing . And as far as the height of the buildings , I'm wondering if we stop them from building 120 feet, are they going to need two or three more blocks? And it is crowded there. I was there about three years ago and I couldn't wait to get home. No knock to the medical services . But it wasn't fun. A guy came in and turned the channel on me and then he turned the TV off. It was a community TV. I didn't want to disturb him. In fact, I seen his obituary about three months later. So I was glad I didn't say anything . Once again vax. Here, I'm no BS'er. There's two vaccinations on each one of these cards. They're all for me. And there was an article in the paper the other day about our Republican Governor . He plans to make everybody reregister . He's not even Governor yet and he's announcing that he's going to engage in tyranny . What's he doing there, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 know? It's really a shame. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Too many people announcing conspiracies before they are even elected . They should be arrested. MR. DONAHUE : That exhaust the sign-in sheet for tonight . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . First I would like to ask someone to contact Mr. West. I've put -- placed two calls to him to discuss the Land Bank properties and I have not had any response from him. Apparent ly he is unaware that the City is responsible for all the vacant lots that are -- belong to the Land Bank. And the one in the 500 block of Harrison Avenue is really needy. Now, 7-A, I've talked about metrics before, and I'll talk about them again tonight . How are we going to know that this was a good program ? Can you tell me? How do we know the economic development has increased because of this project ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 And I think that perhaps they should finish one project such as the Pocket Park before they start with a brand new program . And again, East Mountain Road, everybody 's talked about it already . But I -- the crew -- the DPW leader was fantastic . He could communicate with people actually . And the only thing that I would say that could have been changed if somebody -- and it totally got by me until yesterday when I went up to go over the -- now that the project was finished on Monday I went up to look at it. And because Birch Street was not included , it stops at Derby Avenue. And then you have a nasty portion of Birch Street. I think it's about the 1200 block. And then you hit East Mountain Lake Road and it picks up again. So perhaps that could be added to -- that small section could be added to next year's project . 7-G, I don't understand this. I understand there is a salary adjustment that goes with this. And I don't think the middle of the year is a time to change it. Plus, it is I think the more logical thing would be if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 this is a limited , very limited short-term project . And we've already paid -- we already paid 2.3 million dollars to Anser. And you all have the presentation they made. It looks to me as though they're doing this. And if you have a small project or a one-year project , I would say at the end of it if a person could prove that they've done a good job on that they get a bonus. You don't add somebody a permanent increase in their budget for a job that's going to take a year maybe. So I think you need to take another look at that. And acoustics , that definitely was -- tonight I would have sworn and I would have liked to have heard more of our finance chair's presentation . But it was almost as though he was intentionally whispering . At least we used to have one microphone that could be slid down the table. Nothing . And she's right. So I hope if that is the program on schedule that when we come back in September there would be -- MR. DONAHUE : So we're just getting an update, yes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And then Birch Street. Are those plates going to be on Birch Street between Cedar Avenue and South Washington Avenue forever ? MR. DONAHUE : The plate, no. So that's the issue they're having with -- apparently they ordered new hatches. And that's going to take place of the plates. The plates are just temporary . But according to them, the hatches are what's going to alleviate the issue. We'll see what actually comes out of that. MS. SCHUMACHER : My time's up. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , first of all, Mr. Schuster , thank you for looking in with a detailed precision into a contract . It is one of the first times that this body in a long while has at least publically disclosed that they have looked into rather than just block numbers that are given to Council as a gigantic bucket for a project have taken the time to do comps 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 between what other groups, what other industry standard s would have for the same project . Take a look and analyze whether or not by cherry-picking contract s and by cherry-picking vendors who it is supplied to whether or not there is an issue with drastic overpayments just because of groups are considered favorable to the City who are disfavorable to the City's economic health and well-being. There needs to be a standard of review so that when these large line item numbers come across, there is detailed backup so people could understand where the money is hidden within it and where the possible greed and glut and profit taking is coming from. It's not a fact that we don't need projects in the City of Scranton . But there is a responsibility and a duty for the City to make sure that when it spends this money it's done responsible and with responsibility and that it's just not done by large bucket numbers with no line item detail anywhere . It was mention ed about the IT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Department and getting something up on the website . I find that somewhat humorous because as of date, City Council is one member with a to be continued on the City's website . City Council does not even deserve the respect to have their web page updated with information on four out of the five Council members . So I could understand why a community member would wonder how difficult it is to get something changed when this body isn't even shown the respect that it should be on IT's own site. As of Anser, I have talked to the Mayor's office. I've gotten information back and requested information . And one of the interesting things that came forward is, during the early presentations , it was put out that they had one-on-one meeting s. And they had I think was 25 or 30 community stakeholders that were involved before the January request to the public. It seems through inquiring there was no stakeholders because I can't get that name. There were no public meeting s. There were no stakeholders . And everything that was said 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 before the Council and disclose d to the public evidently is not true. It's either that or at this point they just don't want to divulge the stakeholder s. I have to pursue it further because I did an open records request . And the City says they have no names or any minutes or anything from meeting s from any community stakeholders . I don't know how they cannot have meeting s, yet publically say they've had them with I think 45 to 65 stakeholders who seem to now at this point by name don't exist. Last, I look at Juneteenth. I understand the reasons for it. I also look at the -- if it's another holiday will it incur holiday pay for union employee s and City workers ? We have Martin Luther King. We have Black History month. I understand Juneteenth is a switch from that. But how about Human Rights Day? We don't have that on December 10th or UN Day. How about recognition for the Nese{phonetic }, the American interred Japanese people as March 20th, which was closure of the internment camps that the US put in their own citizens .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 How about Native American or Indigenous Day, which is the fourth Friday in September ? How come we seem to lack recognizing all of these other groups? I think we need to be more comprehensive towards a number of parties . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Yes. I would like to make a motion to reconsider Resolution No. 71 of 2022. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor to reconsider -- sorry. There's a motion on the floor to reconsider -- what was it, Mr. King? Sorry. MR. KING: It would be Resolution No. 71, 2022. MR. DONAHUE : Resolution No. 71 of 2022, which is a contract with Nossaman and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 Associates . This would be -- the motion would be a motion to reconsider . I believe Mr. King voted against the resolution . So if we vote on a motion to reconsider , we would then have to figure out how it appears on our agenda for next week. So we're just voting on the motion to reconsider tonight . We won't be voting on any resolutions . MR. KING: And if you recall, I tried to table it that evening . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. On the question ? MR. KING: Okay. So that evening I did try to table it and to get some answers from the Mayor about, you know, I guess it is a lobbyist that would be representing the City just to get more information about what it is that they were going to be doing for the City. And she provided a memo. Is this memo listed in Third Order tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : No, we could put it in Third Order for next week. MR. KING: For next week if we could, yeah. It was dated June 1st regarding Federal Government Affairs assistance . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MS. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so on the question , if we're going to make a motion in Fifth, do we have to put that in writing beforehand ? MR. DONAHUE : No. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. With that being said, I just want to, I guess, warn my other Council members that there's been a pattern that's been occurring . It's when certain items get voted down, they are brought up for reconsideration or they're -- other sources are found to secure these positions and other things. And I feel like Council is folding here with this one. And we're going down a slippery slope. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I agree. This was voted down. And I'll vote it down again. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor -- DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I was in support of this piece of legislation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 when it was introduced in Fifth Order. And then I was absent from the meeting when it had been voted down. So I am in support of the motion to reconsider . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? The only thing I have is, Attorney Gallagher , would you be able to -- I think the question is does it have to be reintroduced or how does that work. So could we -- would you be able to look into that just for Frank by the end of the week? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yeah, I will. I believe it does have to be reintroduced. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I would think so. I didn't know what the -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : But I'll touch base with Frank and Council members . I'll get you an answer tomorrow . MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. All those in favor of the motion to reconsider signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. DONAHUE : The ayes have it and so moved. Do you have anything else, Mr. King? MR. KING: No. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : Two things. Number one, we did receive the labor billing request that I asked for probably over a month ago which I would like to put in Third Order next week. Mr. Voldenberg , if we could put the labor billing in Third Order for next week? I wish I had a copy of it tonight to show the public what it looks like, but I'd say more than 60 percent has been redacted . From the page I saw today, it didn't look like you could make any sense of what was in the billing other than the prices. Other than that, this week was June 6th. It was the anniversary of D Day. I didn't really see too much about it. But I would just like to say thank you to those troops. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do not at this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 time. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Just a quick one, Mrs. Jeffries ' concern about the IT Department and putting that on the website , could you -- she placed two calls and didn't get an answer. Can you please follow up with that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And, Mr. Voldenberg , on that, could you see what the process is on that point what the process is for organizations , citizen s, to put in requests for events to be put up on the website ? MR. VOLDENBERG : All right. I'll do that also. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just a couple things tonight . Mrs. Jeffries also brought up the technology upgrade s. And that's going to be a part of the initial part of it is going to be a part of the sound system upgrade . In terms of running the wire, we're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 not going to get to phase two, which is then, you know, having the ability to have screens and have them up there. But with the changes to the sound systems , we're also going to have them put in place, you know, the wiring that would be needed to eventually do that. So we're only -- but it's not going to be done as part of that project . But we are moving in that direction . It's still, you know, for work to be done in -- we did -- Mr. Voldenberg sent me an e-mail today in response to a question I have. I just haven't had a chance to look at it yet. But it's still -- August is still the target there. And then just in terms of Center Street, it's only a small section of Center Street. We're not really -- you know, we're not giving it to anybody . It's being used as a public event space. But we're just asking that really that Scranton Tomorrow lead the effort in terms of, you know, what policies are in place for putting it out for the public to request that space. You know, this sort of idea has been successful in a lot of other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 cities as more of a city center and a place for people to congregate in a downtown setting . So we're not really giving it away. We're not giving it away to anybody . It's still going to be a city street. We're just closing it to vehicular traffic for it to be more of a pedestrian courtyard. That's all I have for this evening . Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. 5-B FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – ADOPTING JUNETEENTH AS A PUBLIC HOLIDAY IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON CELEBRATED ANNUALLY ON JUNE 19. MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , a good -- a good point was brought up during public comment tonight . So can we just ask how it affects our department s when it comes to holiday s and how many department s are affected? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll check, sir. MS. SCHUSTER : Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I think how it was laid out to us to answer Mr. Coyne's question is, they're not -- for the public safety unions, they are not adding an extra day off on the calendar year or an extra holiday . I think the body itself has to decide which one they want to give up for that one. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. MCANDREW : That is how it was explain ed to me in caucus. I'm sure that will be verified by Mr. Voldenberg 's inquiry . MR. KING: We did discuss that, right? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. Right. MR. SCHUSTER : I mean, I'm also bringing it up because it was in the caucus but just getting the clarification of what that is. MR. DONAHUE : Because it was already , you know, declare d a federal and state holiday . So it just needs to be declared a city holiday so that an MOU could be discussed on which one they want to trade off with. Anyone else on the question ? All those in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 13, 2022 - CLOSING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF CENTER STREET AND LEE COURT TO VEHICULAR TRAFFIC TO DEVELOP A PEDESTRIAN “LIVING ALLEY” TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DOWNTOWN AND ENCOURAGE PUBLIC HEALTH THROUGH PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY . MR. DONAHUE : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. MCANDREW : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , just to clarify too, you know, during -- I believe it was Ice Fest, this section of -- the Ice Festival , this section of Center Street was used. And it was actually used well in terms of a pedestrian meeting place and event space as an example . Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I also believe that this past First Friday in Scranton , there was some more foot traffic along that street and just going to give a preview to what it may seem like when the street is closed down. I think this would ensure the safety of pedestrians who are there so that vehicles aren't travelling down the street. There will still be access to the bank and to the parking that is also along that street. I think that it's a great idea. I have been to other cities that do have something like this. In Dublin, Ireland , there's a really neat section of town that is popular , especially among tourist but that does have a walking path where vehicle s are not allowed and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 that there are several businesses and bars that people frequent . So I'd love to see something in our City that gives people that opportunity to congregate . And according to the backup, Scranton Tomorrow will be ones to administer that project just because they have other project s for the City. I don't think that means they can't also take this on and make it a successful project . That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I've seen a model like this in Lancaster a couple years ago when I went there with my wife. And it was vibrant during the day -- a weekday and at night. And it was an artery to some other business es. So it was a pretty cool experience I'm hopeful to experience here. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 88, 2022 – ADDING THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 RESPONSIBILITIES OF “AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT (ARPA) DIRECTOR ” TO THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ’S PORTFOLIO AND ALLOCATING ARPA ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS ACCORDINGLY PURSUANT TO THE CITY OF SCRANTON ARPA SPENDING PLAN (RESOLUTION 69 OF 2022). MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-G. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so like I stated last week -- and this is nothing personal . So first of all, Mrs. Cipriani came here, wouldn't move into the City and got a salary. I voted no for her position . I voted no for the waiver to allow her to work here without living here. Then she's here about two years. She got two raises. Last year's over $10,000 and then now this ARPA raise is going to be $35,000 more. That's $5,000 less than the City Controller makes. So now her salary will be $100,000, is getting paid more than the Mayor. In good conscience , I can't support someone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 making, first of all, a hundred dollars and not living here. It was okay when it was 50. Well, it wasn't okay for me. But 100 now is just -- it's a game changer for me even more so, to make more than the Mayor who is required to live here. And then also to the fact that I mentioned last week even though I'm voting no, I think the ARPA money dictates -- okay, we need a director . There's money for a director . There is two corresponding position s that are posted now. So I still believe that, you know, let's hire a director . It's only for five years. It's not for an eternity and have one person with laser beam focus on the disbursement of these funds and not someone who has two other divisions of the city on her plate. So I'm just reiterating what I said last week and I will be voting no. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : So also on the question , I stated some similar points last week. At this point I feel that Mrs. Cipriani 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 is spread too thin with LIPS and Code Enforcement . And that's been put on the back burner. And I wouldn't be able to -- to put more on her plate, I wouldn't feel good about that. So I did ask last week of how her time spent during the week would be allocated. We did get a response back today. And it was stated that -- the Mayor asserted in a memo to us that Mrs. Cipriani devotes 64 percent of her time to OECD, 17 percent to Code Enforcement , and 19 will be allocated to the ARP funding . Like I said, at this point I feel she's spread too thin with LIPS and Code Enforcement . And I think we're putting that on the back burner. And I think 17 percent to put towards Code Enforcement isn't enough at this point in time. I wouldn't want to put more on her plate. I'm glad that Mr. McAndrew brought up the waiver. At that point when a waiver was adopted, I think her salary was around $52,000. Now we're at the point of $100,000. I think at that point we should be moving into the City. It's also my understanding that HUD reimburse s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 the City for OECD salaries including Mrs. Cipriani 's. So with her time spent if she's only spending 64 percent of her time with the OECD, how can the City get fully reimburse d from Mrs. Cipriani 's salary. So that's going to be a question I'm going to send to you, Frank. If she's only allocating 64 percent of that time to OECD, how are we being fully reimburse d for her salary? MR. DONAHUE : We're not being fully reimbursed for her salary. A part -- because of her LIPS responsibilities , the City does cover a portion of that salary. MR. SCHUSTER : If we can still send that over, Mr. Voldenberg . I'm just making sure we're above board with that. And also it was brought up in public comment about switching salaries in the middle of the year. I think we have to look into do we have to open the budget for a salary change mid year. I will also be voting no. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? First off, you know, I do think that she really just oversees Licensing and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Inspections . Licensing and Inspection s still has a Director . I do think it's tied into community development . And I also think that the ARPA money needs to be tied into all the other grants that we're applying for through the City. So I do see some linear justification for that there in order to maximize our ARPA dollars . It's better to just use that as a grant match than to fully fund that project . Also, the Anser advisor s did recommend that we hire three full time -- three ARPA staff members , one being a director , two being a project manager ; and one to do constituent services and communications meaning to sell the grant program s that are out there whether it would be for nonprofit s, for small businesses to allow them to go out and let them know that those funds are available . I also think that the City -- I believe the City does need to have a point person to sign off on any reports that doesn't -- that isn't covered under Anser's contract with quarterly reports that need to be sent to the federal government regarding any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 ARPA spending there. So I think, you know, in terms of whether you hire another full-time person to do that or not, I feel like we are saving money. And with federal money, that has to be justified . So I'm confident that time sheets will be taken there in order to justify the covering of that salary. So I will be voting yes because I believe it does add more money that we could spend in terms of programming and not in administrative costs. MR. KING: I would like to add that the short time that I'm here, I've been pretty impressed with Mrs. Cipriani in terms of the number of grants she's been able to apply for and get awarded. So I believe that she has the ability , the capability and the skills to be able to handle this load. And I'll be voting yes. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I provided my reasoning last week and some very similar reasons to what Councilman Donahue had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 explain ed as to why he's voting on this piece. I was happy that we did receive today what her breakdown would be for time spent to each area for her role. And Code Enforcement does have its own director . So she's not perform ing all the duties that would be needed for the director of that department . I believe she just oversee s it and assists where she can. And she's already been doing much of the work that the ARPA director would be doing. I think she's been really critical to our communication with Anser and in our development of our plan for the ARPA funds for our City. So I believe we do need to designate someone as a director . And I'm confident that she will be able to take on that role. And I'm in support of this piece. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, so I just want to swing back here a little bit. So let me understand this clearly . So we're making Mrs. Cipriani the ARPA Director . All right. And she's only going to dedicate 19 percent of her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 day to disbursing 60-some million dollars and overseeing it. I have a bigger problem with that. 19 percent of anybody 's day from -- okay, say she works more than eight hours a day, we'll give her credit for that because that was kind of explain ed to us. But just do the math, 19 percent of a workday devoted to the American Rescue Plan as a director , I don't think that's what that position was designed for coming down from ARPA and its conception or even through Anser. I just have a little problem if that's the only amount of time -- and I know she's going to have two subordinate s and that's fine. But as a director , 19 percent is a small part of the day. MR.
