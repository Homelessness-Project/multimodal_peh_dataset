The first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I just want to start by letting you know the library is having a book sale from now through Sunday at the Marketplace at Steamtown , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 second floor in front of the gym. You can get any kind of books, children books, adult books, CDs, DVDs. You could get a hardcover fiction or nonfiction book for no more than $2. No supply chain problems . Get your Christmas shopping done. If you buy one of our tote bags on Saturday or Sunday, everything you stick in it is free. Okay. News on audit, anything ? MR. GAUGHAN : Nope. For the second year in a row it's going to be late. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okie dokie. All right. With regard to the Times Tribune article yesterday , Courtright era lawsuits . I noted that three of the four lawsuits , the settlements are not covered by the City's insurance . Is that something that like 910,000 of the 1.1 million ? MR. GAUGHAN : I believe so. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Will that come out of the contingency fund or is there a special fund for that? MR. GAUGHAN : I believe it will come out of court awards. MS. HODOWANITZ : Court awards. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Okay. All right. I assume you're going to have two more Council meetings December 7th and December 14th. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Is that the plan? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Any hope of getting the union contracts on legislation to get those passed by the end of the year or you don't know? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't know the timeline . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okie dokie. With regard to the legislation on the Wyoming Avenue Streetscape Project , I have two comments . One, since the 100 block of Wyoming Avenue is largely occupied by the County Government Center, are they at all involved in helping to fund that? I know you're going for a grant. But are they involved in that? Are we working with them for upgrade s to that block? MR. GAUGHAN : I'm not sure. I could inquire about that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 second question is, I think that's a worthwhile project , especially since you are going for a grant. But what about the other parts of the City? There are many sections of the City neighborhood s that don't even have sidewalk s as Ron Ellman will tell if he comes back up here. And I think it's commendable that we're focusing on the downtown . But we can't do that to the exclusion of other neighborhoods . Those people pay taxes too. And it's about time that we look at their health and safety requirements . I know because many times I'm in those other neighborhoods and I end up walking on the street because you can't walk on the sidewalk if there is a sidewalk . So keep that in mind as we do these project s in the future. With regard to the quality of life legislation , I think that's another worthy piece. However , we've often seen ordinances and resolution s, especially quality of life. And it's one thing to say this is the standard . It's another thing to see enforcement . I would like to see enforcement of these increased fines. There's no point having legislation if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 you are not going to enforce it. It's just a waste of time. Rental registration , I think you may have a typo you want to correct . The cost of a license shall be as follows ; in calendar year 2022, $45 payable on or before November 1, 2021. Did we miss that milestone ? You know, this is the kind of thing where attention to detail comes in. There ought to be one person at City Hall that just sits down and reads document s and makes sure this kind of thing doesn't happen or you're going to be amending the legislation . And involvement policy, I was very happy to see the fund balance in investment policies . But again, look at paragraph 10 on reporting . The first sentence makes no sense whatsoever. It's missing several words. Also, I think in the document -- is it this one or another one -- oh, I think it's the quality of life document . The last words on the right-hand margin are completely gone because it didn't fit in the scanner or something went wrong. So you need to take a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 look at that. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And we've, Miss Hodowanitz , identified those mistakes . It came down from the City Law Department . So we'll correct those mistakes when we amend the legislation . MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, but someone in administration before they come down to you. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. MS. HODOWANITZ : Just sit and read it. I mean, a fifth grader could do it. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . MR. GAUGHAN : Good evening . MR. COYNE: Good evening , Council . I believe it was two weeks ago it was brought up that City Council should have put the Biden Street to referendum . I wanted to circle back at that and bring back that directly after the City passed that ordinance , I came in here specifically before the Council and voiced the proper path for citizen s to take if they wanted that as a referendum . City Council can put something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 before referendum but is not bound to. But that does not strip the population of the City to putting things before a referendum. There is a policy in place just for that. And a failure of the citizens to follow proper procedures in putting forth for referendum is not something that should damn this City Council . On a separate topic, we're going to be talking about the IT coming up in a few days. I have many questions . And, of course, I'm not sure if any of you are highly skilled in the IT analysis department , if any of you've worked in IT before or have any depth of understanding of what is required for IT. Some of the questions I wonder is, is there going to be a LAN WAN type of network here? How is that going to be parsed out? Are you going to specific ally (inaudible ) for the city service cost? If you lose your internet service , are you going to have landlines as duplicates just as a fallback? We have no job descriptions yet. One of the primary things in IT security is as part of HIPAA laws, which I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 more versed in is defining security access for personnel by the jobs that they do. You give them the least access possible to complete their job. People in Licensing and Inspection should not be looking up information that is in City Council . There needs to be security measures rather than just full access to anyone who is in the system. And they need to be reviewed and audited on a regular basis. I'm curious since we were hacked if the IT Department at any given time has contracted with an outside vendor to actually do penetration testing to the system and if it's done on a regular basis because any secure government or business should have a contracted outside vendor who actually tries to break into their system so they could find out where those holes and fix them before somebody actually finds them independent ly. With phones and VoIP, there's issues like double matting which I'm not going to get into because it's complex . We're looking now at Bedrock Technology as the go-between . And I understand it's been stuck in the Eighth Order 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 for a while. If we are going to go to a management system, a contracted managing system, maybe it's time to terminate the director and network person in the City for that same position because if we're going to be contracting with an outside vendor to manage our system, we don't need two managers . We don't need people doing duplicate services for the same exact task. It's a waste of money. And last, I'm going to pull back to the trash that I had talked about a few weeks ago. Is the trash being put into its separate interest bearing account ? MR. GAUGHAN : No, it's not. Actually , I have a detailed response . And I could read it in Fifth Order if you would like. I just have to get it. It's in one of my folders here. MR. COYNE: That's perfectly fine. And I would also like to respond back then, why if it's not being put in that order, how does City Council and the City government decide what part of the laws they pass, they follow and do not follow? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 This is codified that this was suppose d to be done. If it's not being done, who chooses which laws that the City decides to follow and does not? Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Bob Bolus, Scranton . On 7-B, I believe that should be tabled right now. After reviewing some of the stuff in it I think there needs to be much more of an examination of the efficiency of how to run DPW than what they're trying to do. Trucks should on natural gas. There should be so much more, right-hand turns, Pak Master should have snowplows on them. Many years ago when Mayor Peters was here and we were a Brockway {sic} dealer, we designed and engineered eight different trucks for the City in the DPW, section trucks and Pak Masters . So I believe you need to get in a little bit more depth and talk to some of the people in the industry around here and educate yourselves more than and just listen to what these people have to say. There's a lot of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 flaws in it. And I would ask that that be tabled until you have a little more discussion , a little more knowledge about what's going on. The other part that I think has to be done with that is you have to have a public meeting here and educate the people how our City is run in efficiency . Mr. Schuster , you are in charge of finance . I would ask that you make a motion tonight for a forensic audit to the City of Scranton , the finances , so we never have to have what we had here tonight or in the newspapers with Mr. Gaughan going after the Mayor and this and that. This is not what we're about. In fact, quite honestly , Bill, I think you owe the Mayor an apology . MR. GAUGHAN : Listen, I would never take a lesson in civility -- MR. BOLUS: I'm talking about -- MR. GAUGHAN : That's not your strong suit. Let's be honest. MR. BOLUS: -- I believe you should owe the mayor an apology for going to the newspapers and publically embarrassing the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 people in the City of Scranton , okay, by going in and commenting that she didn't know what she was doing and all the stuff that went on in that budget. Okay, it's not the way you operate . It's not the way business should be conducted . MR. GAUGHAN : Thanks. MR. BOLUS: Okay, and you need to turn around and take a real hard look -- I brought up a lawsuit on Nay Aug Park with the Recreation Authority . You personally went against it or you accepted 100,000 a year. We wanted 7 or 800,00 for all the cars that are parked in there. You pay $2 an hour in front of the hospital to park a car. You should be bringing 8, 900,000 in for all those parking spaces up there. This is a business that Geisinger has that throws millions around like jelly beans. Yet, you went ahead and put $500,000 on a tax on the people and let that slide. This is what I'm talking about the efficiency of running this City why you need a forensic audit, why you need to go back where you need to be to the basics and get away from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 all of this nonsense . I have been here for many, many years. We've been here doing this. I just think that it's an embarrassment what I saw here and what I read in the paper. I came up from Florida . And I opened the paper and I saw that. It turned my stomach . Okay, I had an injunction hearing this past week with the injunction for the signs on Biden. You people agree with them. We disagree . We're the people of the City of Scranton . We should have had a say in it. The people on Spruce Street, they all came here. They had a say and you people ignored them, yet they are the ones that pay the taxes that prevent this City. To see those signs, see what's going on around the world that he's creating is an embarrass ment. Maybe not to you but it is to us. I was in Florida , have people say where are you from? I said Scranton . They said, you got to be kidding . Do you know that idiot? I said, yeah, I knew him when we were kids. So it's not pleasure . You want to do it in the City, fine. But it shouldn 't be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 on the interstates . No way, shape, or form should there be signs saying the expressway for Biden. It should be, Scranton next exit. The state and the federal government own those roads, not the City of Scranton . And our litigation is trying to force them now to remove those signs off the interstate because of what's going on in this country . Remember Joe Biden incinerated men, women, and seven children , killed 13 of our fellow vets and how many more came home maimed that you don't want to hear a word about. This is what I'm talking about. We're Scranton ians and we deserve better. And we deserve camaraderie between you and the Mayor. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Next speaker is Jack White. MR. WHITE: Good evening friends , neighbors , Council people. I hope you're all enjoying this season of light and everybody you love and that loves you back are well. I have been paying attention to Pete Buttigieg out there in Indiana roads and streets . And he talks about the health of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 City and how it relates to taking care of the road and the streets . Those pictures are not Siberia . They're Moosic Street in Scranton between Harrison and Meadow, a couple hundred yards there. Some of those holes -- well, the whole thing is one big slice gone. Years of neglect , decades of neglect . And, you know, it's a simple -- if I may, a simple solution , gravel. It -- you don't need to pave it, but you can't walk there. Believe me. I was there today. There is water. There are foot deep -- you can't walk there. You cannot walk there. They are a foot deep. And they are covered with water so you can't see the holes. And they will be covered with snow. And you can't see the holes. Anyway, simple fix, gravel. One day DPW could be there. And I'm sure we have the gravel. It's over there in the DPW hideout. So Buttigieg , wonderful man, reminds me of you a little bit, Bill, you know, how he presents himself and stuff like that, a real straight shooter who cares about citizens . He is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 cleaning up I don't know what town it is. But he's cleaning up the country with infrastructure and things like this. He's a good guy, good heart. I think he will be president some day if he's not careful . So but, you know, it's -- we -- mostly in politics we don't pay attention . This is all my opinion -- to the small stuff. You know, we talk about budgets, finances . But if you notice, you know, if I see you in the street or something , you may say, Hey, Jack, how are you? And I'd say how are you back. And I don't say how is your budget, how are your finance s, can I see your checkbook ? We need -- our citizens here want synchronicity . You talked about roads, sidewalks . This is what we want. This is what we need. The newspaper covers budgets and conflicts between the branches of government . I care about that stuff. But I don't want my neighbors breaking a leg. I don't want that to happen. And we can't sue City Hall for the neglect . I'm not saying you guys. This is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 decades old. Two truckloads of gravel, if it wasn't for politics , Bob Bolus would have that job done tomorrow . But it goes into committee and, oh, should we do it, you know, maybe we should pave. Don't pave it. It's not going to pay. It's going to start -- if you put gravel in there, you're going to stop the erosion . Put up some drain things. We all care about -- I love the City. I have been here four years, Hill Section , Wheeler Avenue I said that. The streets are looking really good. Pete Buttigieg talks about three-way stop signs. It's the most -- it's where most people are hurt, three way. We don't need them. We do not need three-way stop signs. We need caution signs. I mean, Ash Street maybe we don't need anything . But three-way stop signs are dangerous . We -- I'm done. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. WHITE: Bye. MR. GAUGHAN : Have a good night. MR. WHITE: Oh, I have to leave 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 right after citizen s participation , art show at the AFTA. We're hanging it on Friday, First Friday, a great show including my three pieces. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Good. Thank you. Have a good night. Next speaker is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening Council . And I'm going to start tonight off with a little thank you to Mr. Gaughan for responding to all my question s that I had sent to you regarding the Parking Authority . And after I read them, you know, I had some questions still about them. But basically if I have those questions , I'm sure others have. And I was wondering is there a Q and A that could be put someplace so that people would be able to know what to do about the kiosks on the street, okay? That was the only thing I had about that. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MS. JEFFRIES : And to, Dr. Rothchild , the intersection of Linden and Harrison , I don't know if those weeds are down because of the frost or if someone did cut them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 down. But it's good to see that they're gone and they cleaned up that corner. So thank you. I'm here to talk again about the park and the light show that's going on at the park and just to give a little few more details about that and that it's running every night from 5:00 to 10:00. We do accept donations at the end of the display after they've gone through the park and also to give a shoutout to the people and the workers at the Parks and Recreations Department and the volunteer s that come to the park and have put that show together . There is a lot of new lights and things that have gone up. We're using LED lights because that's more efficient . And they're brighter. And it just makes the displays that we do have more visible . So I wanted to give a shoutout to the Parks and Recreation and especially to John Dunbar. Today I went up to the park because another resident had made a huge sign that said thank you. And I took it up to the park. I wasn't sure who I was going to run into up there this morning .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 But John was there. And he and another one of the workers were very gracious about putting that sign up for me. And they placed it as you come through the tent area right as you go out into the street on Author Avenue. And there's big sign that says thank you because we really do thank those people that have come and gone through the park and have given us a donation . So then next year we could even have a bigger and better park. Also, I wanted to talk about the hayride. We do the hayride that goes through the park. And it goes through all of the displays . It only runs through Thursday to Sunday -- Sunday to Thursday so that -- because it gets backed up with the traffic on some of the other nights. So they've chosen to do it on that particular night. And it's a regular hayride with the bales of hay and everything and you sit in the wagon. And it pulls you through the park. So it's quite a nice addition to the park. It costs $5 for adults and children 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 are free. So the only thing I say come on out, dress warm and enjoy the light show that is there for all of us at the City of Scranton . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Next speaker is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you, Council . I'm very pleased to see our Mayor here tonight . She needs to see how some real people in the City what they have to say and how they feel about things. I'm not an anti-mayor person like some people are saying I was. I'm anti-developer s and anti-illegals but not anti-mayors. You know, a couple of days ago the paper, Mr. Jefferson who seems to be worshipped like a hero in this City wants to have a new project , I think it's 60-something million and doesn't have the funding . And they're talking about a 24 million dollar grant from Harrisburg . This is -- this is ridiculous for crying out loud. You want to have 24 million dollars . If he's that short, he wants free money from the taxpayer s to enhance his own self. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 This can't be allowed anymore. These developers , they do everything under the sun to keep their tax base down. And here the City is -- Mr. Evans said last year there must be 5,000 houses abandon ed, foreclose d and for sale or rent. Developers have gotten money from buildings and people are paying taxes on houses they can't rent anymore because they go onto the newer stuff. Something needs to be done about it. If they don't have money to build then, you know, let them go to the bank or something . And I don't believe you would know it, but when the City was -- I think got the 300,000 or something for the wall downtown , the previous administration had a 3 million dollar grant for the people of Scranton . We needed a fire truck, some fire stations had leaky roofs and so on. And this money was taken away from the people of this City by Henry Amoroso who worked for Lackawanna College who was on the administration and given to Lackawanna College . I think -- I think you could go back and get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 our money from him with Mr. Shapiro 's help. This was not a kosher deal. Henry Amoroso signed papers on the Sewer Authority and he's not an attorney . I stood right here and announced he had no legal standing . His law firm isn't in Pennsylvania . He still signed it, got 40-some thousand dollars , I think. Anyway, I wish you'd get our 3 million dollars back from Lackawanna College . Courtright gave them a couple million dollars when the pandemic started . And here they were with a mile long line of cars at the high school. I didn't see anybody giving any money for Sister Adrian's food drives. I remember Mr. Munley standing up saying they got multi-million dollar cases left and right. But they qualified up to a million dollar PPP loan. If this isn't some kind of favoritism , Mr. Courtright's wife getting money like that, I give up. But as far as the 24 million dollars , think what the City could do it with. You could reduce taxes and loans would help instead of letting Jefferson have 24 million 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 dollars to enhance himself . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Have a good night. David Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , Mayor. Okay, to start, you know, there has been some things said with the proposed budget. And I don't know how we can plan on anything without the audit. And it's been late every year for years and years and years. I heard one of the last of the Mohicans good ole boys was responsible this time with our Sewer Authority . And it's -- I don't know how we can plan without that. So there is nothing we can do about it now. But next year if we at least get it by July or whatever , I'm not a paper person. I was in the automotive repair business all of my life. So I'm not really that good with documents . But, you know, I don't know how can you plan -- MR. GAUGHAN : Excuse me, Mr. Dobrzyn . I'm sorry, please take it outside 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 if you have a conversation . Go ahead. MR. DOBRZYN : I don't know how you could plan for anything without knowing how much is or isn't in your bank account . And once again, I'd like to mention -- and it's a great time to mention it, television recycling . They are piling up as I mentioned three or four times already . They're piling up in the courts. And we have to find a way to get those televisions out to a Recycling Center. And I'd be more than willing to pay for my televisions . But I don't need to have people dropping them off on my lawn either which quite frequently happens, not televisions but just about everything else. And last week I spoke about electric cars. And the film with Michael Moore, it's probably available online for free, Planet of the Humans. And it does question our ability to have so many electrical devices all running at once as a substitute for fossil fuels. So we need to slow down the talk of it a little bit. And once again, one was demonstrated last week and it was a humvee. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 I used to -- actually when this SUV came out, I used to have to put a jack stand under each leg of my lift because it was 1,500 pounds overrated to the design of a lift. Ridiculous . And disappointing as our schools are already seeming to reject the payroll tax. And we need to go over tax exempts and make sure they are nonpartisan also because if you are a partisan tax exempt, you don't deserve to be a tax exempt, period. And once again on COVID, we have the fifth concerning variant . They don't know whether -- I think it was not Moderna but the other one -- aren't sure if they're not going to have to tweak it and we're still all wearing masks. I have been out to public affairs about three times in the last year and a half. A concert with the mask on doesn't appeal to me. Please go out and get your shots because it is -- it is the nonvaccinated that are most apt to get it and pass it around. And by the way, the antivaxers are dying at a rate of twice the vaccinated or -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 well, there was an article in the paper if you voted for Trump, you're more than likely to be an antivaxer and two times more likely to die. So they are probably four or six percent and we're two percent . So that about wraps it up. Thank you. Have a good evening . I will probably have to duck out a little bit early. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Still Marie Schumacher . Two quick things, I hit the red light going down Mulberry and Penn Avenue and our LERTA marketeers are at it again. They still have that on their digital billboard . They are saying, you know, work in Scranton , no taxes for 10 years. I just -- that is bait and switch. And I personally wouldn't have anything to do with somebody who pulled that on me if I was a business person coming, looking to start a business . And then Scranton Tomorrow used to come regularly . I don't know when they were here last. But there seems to be a total 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 standstill at that lot on Linden and Wyoming . And I just wondered if we could get some information on that. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : And then I now want to go back to last week because I just don't understand . I hope I never hear soon 1700 block of Wyoming Avenue again. This has dragged on since 1995 that I know of that that problem started . And the fact that that garage is not demolished , last week I told you that I -- that the Mayor had talked about it at your -- one of your budget meeting s is that it's the owner, the property owner of the garage and that they keep moving the post. And then Elaine Cipriani said they keep asking for things that probably aren't doable. That's my own words. But it's -- the meaning is there. And I -- then I said that I had heard and from a reliable source I believe that the owner of that property as his attorney had tried several times getting in touch with the City Solicitor and no answer, no feedback at all. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Now, somebody there is way -- you talk about moving posts, they don't get much further apart than that. And you said -- I've suggested you guys go down or some of you go down and talk to them and find out whose -- where the posts are really. I just think this needs to get done. And you said you couldn't go out there. You are only the, you know, the administrators . I don't understand . You were out there with Mr. Young, how many times? You sat here and told us what was going on. Why can you go to one property owner and not go to the other? I really -- tonight , I'm going to ask if the Times can't do something to find out what's going on and why that garage is still standing . This is just terrible . Do you have any idea on how this could be resolve d in a reasonable amount of time? MR. GAUGHAN : I agree that it's terrible. But it won't make any -- the man has an attorney . It won't make any sense for me to go out there. The attorneys are apparently dealing with each other. Solicitor Hayes, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 would it be appropriate for me to go out and deal with an individual homeowner when there's potential litigation and this is tied up between attorneys ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, well, you have a solicitor . ATTY. HAYES: No, it wouldn't be appropriate or product ive I don't believe . You know, it's being handled by the Law department . I think they are well aware of the issues and are trying to find the best resolution they can. MS. SCHUMACHER : Are we going to just sit here and twiddle our thumbs -- MR. GAUGHAN : But, Miss Schumacher , please, that's not true. Sit here and twiddle our thumbs, that is a gross mischaracterization . I've been on Council for eight years. I tried to help Mr. Young every step of the way. We got him to this point. It's so unfortunate . If I could knock it down myself, I'd be out there with a hammer -- a sledge hammer. It's for some reason tied up with the gentleman that owns the garage or the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 structure . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, what -- time out. Time out. I'm getting low. Tell me then what the City can do to get that done to go out and to talk -- I mean -- MR. GAUGHAN : That would be between the Law Department and him. MS. SCHUMACHER : Somebody has got to do something . MR. GAUGHAN : I agree with you on that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, who does it? MR. GAUGHAN : It's got to be the Law Department . I don't want to get into the -- this is for a Council meeting now -- but, you know, we'll try to get an update for you. And as far as me going out and dealing with that man's attorney -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Somebody needs to do it. That's all I'm saying and I'm out of time. MAYOR COGNETTI : If I could -- Miss Schumacher , if I could speak to that, if I had a dollar for every time somebody accuses me or anyone from the administration , oh, I can't get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 ahold of you. I don't think we have to worry about the budget at all. That is a common refrain . I have correspondence nearly daily from our solicitor about this on my e-mail. Solicitor O'Brien has been working this as hard as he can. Eileen is involved , Eileen Cipriani on the demolition contract piece. That's all teed up. We're now involving our insurance advisor . And there is a meeting set for next week with the property owner. Miss Cipriani had said the same thing, right, goal posts are moving. The owner keeps moving the goal post. Things keep changing . That continue s to be the case. We are trying to get it resolved as quickly as possible . What we cannot do is just go onto the property and bulldoze it ourselves. We could do that but I believe we would set ourselves up for litigation that would be far more expensive than we would be willing to do. So it's a very difficult position . But I guarantee you it's not for a lack of focus from the Law Department , the administration ; and again, there is a meeting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 with the property owner. I believe it's next week was the first opportunity the property owner was willing to meet. And we'll continue to work on it. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Okay, before we go into fifth order and comments from Council people, the Mayor is with us along with Corey Burbach . I hope I said your last name correctly from Anser Advisory Services and Dan Connelly as well. And they are here to discuss agenda Item 7-C. Agenda Item 7-C is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to -- and the City to execute and enter into a contract with Anser Advisory and Government Services Group to provide consulting services associate d with the American Rescue Plan Act. So I will turn it over to you now if you would like to make a few comment s. MR. BURBACH : Evening Council members , Mayor, community . As mentioned , my name is Corey Burbach , I'm a director with Anser Advisory . A little about Anser Advisory and why we're here and able to help cities like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Scranton with their American Rescue Plan Program is we've been in business about 25 years assisting local government and municipalities across the country with everything from their advisory compliance from disaster relief federal funding all the way to program and construction management with projections like waste, water, and sewer. So that's why it was very natural for us when the CARES Act came along with our experience with federal funding and in compliance and auditing support to assist local municipalities , cities and counties and then from the CARES Act would transition to the American Rescue Plan. So currently we are advising over 30 municipal ities, cities and counties across the country ranging from roughly a million dollars all the way up to 125 million dollars in American Rescue Plan allocation amounts. So we're assisting counties and cities all the way from kind of what we refer to as a break loss if needed approach where we provide a lot of guidance and oversight all the way through a program (inaudible ) augmentation role. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 We kind of handed out I know we did want to do a presentation tonight of the advisement of the City. So just a little bit about some key dates, you know, how City of Scranton falls in with the metro and one of the services that we provide to you all as part of this contract . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Does anyone have any questions about 7-C? Just a question , Mayor, and you may want to address this. It came up last week. So within your budget you've identified that you are hiring several position using the ARP funding , I think an executive director or someone to institute some of these problem s and oversee the funding . So can you talk about how this contract with Anser Advisory Group and the positions that you have funded not in the budget but with the funding from ARP, how those two mesh together ? One of the concerns last week I think was that they seem like it would be double work almost. I know Eileen Cipriani respond ed to us, but if you could address that. MAYOR COGNETTI : If I say something wrong, please let me know. But the dollar 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 figure that you see in the proposal from Anser would be a full suite of service s that where Anser would kind of take the ball and run on things where we believe if we have the right staffing in our shop, we could do a lot of those pieces inhouse and we wouldn't need Anser to provide that full suite of services . So that's -- the sticker shock I imagine you're referring to from that, we wouldn't be -- sorry guys, we don't plan to pay that much to the consulting firm. We would be looking to have kind of an a la carte working relationship where we figure out what we can do with our band with this in the City and then the Anser firm could compliment that for us. MR. BURBACH : Yeah, no, that's exactly right. And that's about the conversation we had with City staff is and we're certain ly a similar role in a lot of places where it's more of a guidance and review and what I call the shorten ing of the learning curve of this process . You know, I know their first report was about 54 pages of reading and learning and digesting . You know, our internal experts 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 could provide guidance on exactly what needs to be reported . We could review what needs to be reported , make sure, you know, the scarey word right now is claw back -- claw back is prevented , identifying with our auditor s, you know, what allowable -- the uses are, all of that. So there really is peace of mind associate d with the heavy lifting . Right now based on the way the City of Scranton is proposing it being done City staff and Anser Advisory really supporting from a guidance and advisory role. And it all falls under that 10 percent administrative convenience that's allowable under the American Rescue Plan. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And some of the new positions , are you -- are those allowable ? Have we gotten confirmation that you can, in fact, pay for an executive -- all the positions that you have in the budget that you're paying for out of the ARP funds, you can -- you got confirmation that you can use those funds for those positions ? For example , in your office on the original budget, you had a -- I think the title 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 is a tourism and communications coordinator -- communications , events, and tourism coordinator . With the new budget that you present ed to us yesterday , you've moved that to community development and funding with ARPA. So did you get confirmation that you could use that funding for that position and those other positions that you've identified ? MAYOR COGNETTI : That is certainly something that we would check with Anser about. If we're able to hire them. Tourism is -- economic recovery is a huge piece of what the ARP dollars are designed for. So we feel confident we would be able to do that. But we won't hire anyone, spend any money with ARP without checking with our firm first. So these are the -- these economic development position s and, you know, specific is for a director SRA, that is all economic development , communication s and then support staff. You know, not to answer this in this moment but there is administrative -- so up to -- is it 10 percent of the ARP funds can be used for administrative reasons. We certainly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 don't want to hit that mark. We want to use -- have as many dollars on the street as possible . But we have to give ourselves the tools to be able to do it. And we'd work with them to make sure that we were doing it correctly . MR. BURBACH : For us, you know, we want to make sure that 10 percent number is a support staff, not it -- it's more we want to be on the lower side to support the fact that, you know, these dollars are really meant for short-term recovery and long-term regrowth. But when looking at the roles identified , it really comes down to time spent. And that's part of the auditing process is tracking the time spent on the allowable expenses and making sure that we're in compliance . So when we look at things like staff involvement making sure that it was spent and dedicated to the American Rescue Plan recovery and under the allowable expenses . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else have any questions on this? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just quickly , and so in our legislative cover sheet that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 attached with this legislation , it says under financial impact cost at $2,373,560 for the life of the program . And then 390,000 for year one. So are we just guarantee ing, you know, that you're getting 390 put then the cap is 2.3? MR. BURBACH : Yeah, so I think what we're doing is the estimated fee for what we talked about for year one is the 390,000. Now, if staff is taking more of the responsibility and we're taking less of it, then obvious ly we won't get to that 390,000. That was based off the five categories of the RFP and the estimated time spent from a program management standpoint. But I think what we're doing and admittedly what we're learning a lot through this process is, you know, it evolves and changes . So where our roles are one day to next is really dependent on the needs of the particular city. So our project team is about seven people. I didn't introduce Dave Josky{sic}. He's actually on the phone right now. He has another meeting that he's attending .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 So, you know, there is different roles and responsibilities for our project team. If one person is needed more or less for whatever reason, health -- necessity , then we'll serve that role. MR. DONAHUE : So then is that 2.3 then a max on the -- MR. BURBACH : That would be a program manager, staffer augmentation role; and based off the RFP what we find is easier rather to demonstrate what the fee would be and then scale it back from there rather than trying to come back and be like, oh, we got him for X-amount of money and now it's actually going to be a lot more. And it's really hard for, you know, as far as the solicitation process to determine what exactly it is the City's needs are from the documentation until we sit down and talk like we have. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick question . I understand what your role is going to be so, you know, the disbursements , the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 guarding of the money and what it can be used for and not. So that is your responsibility . Moving forward when you decide where this money is to be, used does legislation have to be created for our approval any part of the way or just the legislation tonight ? MAYOR COGNETTI : We plan to work with City Council on all of these pieces. This isn't, you know, this is 69 million dollars that's come to the City. We're not going to not involve City Council in that. So we will be proposing to you all what the spending plan would be. And it's not clear to us yet if that is going to be, you know, I think it would be fluid. This is a long-term thing. We're also needing to understand what other types of funding might be available . But we will present it to you in a similar way to any spending plan in the City. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. I just want to know what our involvement in the process would be. MR. BURBACH : Yeah, I don't want to muddy the water but (audio interruption ) and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 that's part of, you know, what we do as our responsibility is, you know, there's a project (inaudible ) list, right, and we're identifying where the American Rescue Plan dollars are best spent and where can other allowable expenses fall under other the funding opportunities so that we're advising and helping the City get the best bang for the their buck. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. Oh, sorry. DR. ROTHCHILD : Sorry, with regards to the staff members , so the ones that are, like, in our budget proposal , those will be City staff will be responsible for hiring those persons and then they would work along with your firm, your company based on the -- on the plan that they're given? Like, what will the working relationship be like with them and the other cities that you're contracted with? Do they have a similar setup? MR. BURBACH : I think I understood what she's talking about. MAYOR COGNETTI : So the process , the vision will be driven by the City and enhanced 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 by the team. So we'll continue -- you know, we know we -- collectively we -- know what Scranton needs. And we'll put together as we have and we'll keep refining kind of what we think we can -- what we need and what we can do. What will be great working with Anser is the ability for them to look at our pieces and say, hey, you know, that's actually a program you could probably fund more efficiently through infrastructure money coming through PennDOT . Those are those the kind of things that it's just hard for us to have a view on in real time because there is so many moving pieces with all of this money coming through directly to us but also through the state. So they come in with knowledge and a view of cities all over the country and how they're working to do things and, you know, might have ideas of programs or spending that we hadn't thought of that could really help us. I think it will help us be a lot more efficient . But the driver -- the City will still be in the driver seat very, very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 much. And in the same way that we, you know, have sometimes we had outside Council to help us solve a problem or do a gut check on something . But it's very much will still be driven by ARP Director that's in the City. MR. BURBACH : And in no way do we ever view ourselves as, you know, City of Scranton experts . That is you all, right? We're the American Rescue Plan federal funding and guidance expert. So that's where the ownership of what we call the prosperity plan which is kind of the community forward facing document that is part of stakeholder process , that's all driven by the City of Scranton and you expert. We just come in on the advisement of the legislation in the American Rescue Plan. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : And how often can we anticipate receiving updates for Council based on where we're at? Will we be receiving them from Anser as well or will they be coming back to Council Chambers , you know, quarterly or yearly? Do we -- MAYOR COGNETTI : I think that there would be a lot of heavy lifting here in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 next, you know, six months probably , 6 to 12 months. So, you know, I'm sure we would be happy to report at any point. But there will be legislation back and forth with this coming up with how we're going to spend the funding. So that will be a very active process I would think in this first part of the year. And then we'll see -- I think no one knows, right, how once the heavy lifting of this initial spending plan is done, you know, it might be that we would, you know, have fewer question s to ask and answer. At least you guys would maybe have fewer questions asked and answered but once we've kind of set the trajectory of what the big project s are. I'm sure you're happy to come in. MR. BURBACH : No, that's exactly right. I think, yeah, and we're local and -- in a sense. We're about a little over an hour away. Well, Dan is. I'm not going to lie. I live in Austin, Texas. But much to my pregnant wife's chagrin , I'm on the road a lot. You know, so we are attending these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 meeting s, you know, I was in Everett last night in Massachusetts . And so we're here such as you all need us to. I would say, you know, not because the final rule isn't out yet, no one's gotten to exactly the spending portion of it, right? So right now it's about preposition ing. It's a lot of money hitting the street in our county. So how do we set ourselves up for success once we have the projects identified , the final rule has been established and we can proceed with the plan. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : Just in terms of what we know now about the rules, it seems right now that the loss revenue is going to be less restrictive than any other of the funds, correct ? MR. BURBACH : Yes. Yes. MR. DONAHUE : I did say seems like it's going to be. MR. BURBACH : Yeah, I would just say that what we've learned and not to spend too much time on this but from other past 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 experiences and what we learned from auditors is the expenditures under the loss revenue might be most closely scrutinize d. And so it's all about identifying the reasoning in establish ing those opinion s as to why the revenue loss calculation is justified and where those ventures go, you know, don't want to get into specific details. But, you know, if we are looking at debt, there is things we probably avoid. Just because we put it in there doesn't mean we don't want to avoid the nonallowable uses under the American Rescue Plan. MR. DONAHUE : And just so -- I'm just asking just because we do have 5.1 million in a line item under loss revenue for this year's budget. So we just want to make sure that we could identify 5.1 million in our budget that, you know, we assume could possibly , you know, qualify for that loss revenue of funds. MR. BURBACH : Yeah, and that's one of the first things we're working with the City on. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, now I'm shifting gears back to the positions . So you have an ARP staff and outreach service coordinator . And then the third position that was going to be in the Mayor's Office is now going to be also supported with these funds? MAYOR COGNETTI : Correct . So the communication (audio interruption ) -- sorry, I am resigned to the facts that -- yeah, we really need communications help in the City. I realize that. That's not something that I am going to achieve any time soon. So I don't though want to leave on the table the opportunity for us to take advantage of the tourism and economic development pieces that are allowed for under ARP. So this position would report to the ARP Director . They would only do any sort of communication s on ARP pieces. It would absolutely not be a communications person for the City, the Mayor's Office. This would be for ARP only. The other pieces of that, the tourism pieces, we get calls I want to do a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 film in Scranton . I want to bring this office character to Scranton . There are a lot of really great events that are good for economic development . They are good for the City's profile. They're good for our growth that we're going to miss out on if we don't have somebody who could be the point person. So America 250 is coming up, the 250 anniversary of America . There are great things there that I'm going to have to confirm. But having somebody there that is able to work on those things to support the economic development efforts of the City I think would be really important . And if, you know, if we find that that position is not allowable or that it can only be, you know, a part-time position to have someone else's job, you know, we'll be flexible with that. But I pulled it out of the Mayor's office because I know there is no desire up on the dais to -- MR. GAUGHAN : Well, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't assume that because I don't really think we got to that point to be honest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 with you, Mayor. So I wouldn't insinuate anything about how Council feels on position s because we never got to really have an in depth conversation . I don't want to rehash the beginning of the meeting , but the budget wasn't balance d. So we were busy with trying to make sure that all the department s were properly funded. So I would not sit there and insinuate anything or any feelings that Council has because we did not communicate that to you directly . We never got to that point. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : So you also stated ARP director . Do we know who the ARP Director is going to go be? Is this -- is Anser going to be in that position ? Who is going to take the lead on the ARP -- MAYOR COGNETTI : The goal is to -- the goal is hire someone to be in that position here in the City. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And now is that ARP staff, outreach coordinator , where is that that I'm missing this -- the ARP Director , where is that located ? MAYOR COGNETTI : What do you mean 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 where is it located? MR. SCHUSTER : Where is it located in the budget? MAYOR COGNETTI : In the budget? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MAYOR COGNETTI : In the community -- community development and salary detail. MR. SCHUSTER : That's where I'm at. So is this the updated version ? So it's not in the past one. It's in the updated version , ARP Director . MAYOR COGNETTI : That is in your original . It was under BA. We moved it to community development so that all of the -- all of the federal ly funded position s were in one place. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. So that is a fourth position , correct ? So we have two basically staff working with ARP money -- the ARP staff and the outreach service coordinator , correct ? Then the director -- MAYOR COGNETTI : Sorry. So the federally funded position s that we're prosing are for -- we're proposing to fund four with ARP again if we can. There is no -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MR. SCHUSTER : I was just trying to get a beat on it. So it's four funded with ARP. I was just missing -- MAYOR COGNETTI : Correct . And then two -- and then we're proposing two with HUD funding . So those were under the economic development . MS. SCHUSTER : And the ARP Director is a new position . It's not a name change. It's a new position . MAYOR COGNETTI : Correct . ARP Director , SRA Director , communications events tourism , and then ARP, SRA staff. Those would be new positions that we would make sure are allowable under ARP and would go forward from there with all or some if we -- MR. SCHUSTER : Where I was going with that and that was just to clarify where I was going is what types of people are we looking for for those positions ? This is new -- we're getting into new space here. What types of people are you looking for? I'm actually looking for justifications for the positions . MAYOR COGNETTI : You're looking for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 what? MR. SCHUSTER : I'm looking for a justification for these positions because I'm not sure what you're looking for for the positions . MAYOR COGNETTI : So we would like to be able to hire someone for ARP Director that would be able to, you know, really hit the ground running with how to maximize the dollars . So when we think about parks, for example , how we want to be able -- we want to follow the rules and make sure that anything we do with parks (inaudible ) tracks based on the preliminary guideline s. That person needs to be able to determine and work with the Anser firm as well. How can we best utilize that? We don't want to just spend $500,000 on a new skate park when we maybe could have done $250,000 with ARP but then gotten a state grant for the rest. Like, we need somebody who is skilled in grant writing skilled and finding money putting it together so that we're maximizing all of these dollars along the way, somebody who can very ably navigate the state 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 system as well as we try to -- try to make sure that we're doing infrastructure project s efficiently with ARP dollars . Again, we don't want to fund with all ARP something that maybe the infrastructure dollars coming down could also help fund. So this person needs to be really -- have a big vision for what we need, be able to communicate very well and also on the back end be able to effectively manage the dollars , I think be able to write new grants to supplement those dollars and be able to really make the economic development pieces come together . MS. SCHUSTER : And then to, Anser Services , do you feel that you need something , a position of this sort in this city to help you out and to carry out this task? MR. BURBACH : You know, I think right now admittedly we haven't worked with the City yet. I mean, there are a number of cities that have similar population s and allocation amounts that have that position . We have not been able to as part our process to go in and do the gap analysis for reporting and procedure s to identify that. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 will say that in past experience s there are some cities and counties that have the position and others that don't. So I think it would be right now too early for me to advise on that position being needed. I apologize . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. Thank you very much. This is very helpful . And we hope you all have a good night. Thank you for coming. And when you are on your way out if you can hand that microphone to Kathy Carrera . Thank you. We'll give you a minute to clear out. There will be no more questions . This is just Council comment . But you are more than welcome to stay if you would like. No, you need the microphone for roll call. So there is no opportunity for any more -- been through that. Frank? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 time. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , any motion or comment s tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : Nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, not tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Council man Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I'll save my comments for agenda items. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I have a few comments . I just want to address once again this evening the 2022 budget process and explain to the public briefly how this went off the tracks for the second year in a row. I'd like everyone -- to make everyone aware that as we saw tonight , Mayor Cognetti will try to spin this which she has already started to do at the public hearing earlier tonight . What I'm going to lay out for you tonight is the facts. First, the way the budget was present ed to us for the second year in a row is not part of any budgetary process 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 I've ever been a part of in the last eight years. Prior to Mayor Cognetti 's administration taking over, the budgets were always provided free of mistakes with complete narrative s that explain any and all changes . As everyone knows, I was at times at odds with the former Courtright administration . But as I said, the budgets that were provide d gave us the opportunity to have those disagreement s because we did not need to make wholesale changes in the middle of the process . The Mayor's budget this year for the second year in a row was unbalanced and riddled with errors. Last year as I mentioned last week, there were dozens of changes that Council had to make to balance the budget because of errors and mistakes . This year there are 134 changes that the Mayor has proposed in order to make sure that the budget balances and to correct glaring errors. This is no mole hill. This is a mountain . Now, I have three meetings in Council Chambers left. I have no axe to grind. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 This is just totally -- the way it was handled was totally unprofession al. For example , CBA increases not being included , 89 patrolmen listed at a salary of $900,000. That's $10,000 per patrolmen ; employees listed as nonunion when they are, in fact, union, pages missing, columns missing . Last week the SAFER Grant being included in the budget when, quite frankly , they couldn't provide answers on the plan for the balance service which they claimed they were going to sustain those positions in year four, totally unacceptable and unprepared . My job as a Councilman is to ask the sometimes uncomfortable and difficult questions . So in this process , quite frankly , I'm doing my job. The way the budget was presented to Council a few weeks ago in this second or third or fourth or fifth iteration that was present ed yesterday lacked any respect for our office and the public. Similar to the way it was present ed to us on November 15th, it was rushed at the last minute, a complete train wreck. The Mayor, Larry West, and Carl Deeley have failed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 their basic responsibilities outline d in the Home Rule Charter to provide the public and Council with a balanced budget. For the second year in a row they have put the City in a very precarious financial position because of incompetence , laziness , sloppiness , and carelessness . I do not believe in rewarding incompetence . The Business Administrator coincidentally is getting a $10,000 raise along with dozens of other employees in the Mayor's administration . The Mayor stated in the past that she wanted to have a discussion with Council on raises for dozens of employees and new positions . How can we do that as Councilman Donahue noted last week when the basic tenets of the budget are not correct ? And it's not clear to me that adding more staff would fix the issues that exist within this administration . I take my job on Council very, very seriously . And I take no pleasure in spending my last few meetings as a Councilman having to do this but the truth must be told. I am very concerned at the current 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 state of operation s in City Hall, not only is the budget process clearly in shambles , we currently have no HR Director and no IT Director . And all I hear from the Mayor and her staff are excuses . Although the budget this year was a complete calamity , the public can be assured that this Council will take every step necessary to make sure that the budget is balanced and, in fact, correct . And we will pass a budget by December 14th in spite of the Mayor and the Business Administrator 's complete disregard for this process . And as I mentioned earlier tonight , this process was wrong. I have been sitting up here for eight years. There is no way that anybody can tell me that the way that this was handled was correct . It was mishandled for the second year in a row. And that concerns me because last year as I stated last week, we might be able to understand new Mayor, new administration . This is the same nonsense and garbage that we saw last year, complete and utter chaos up and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 until the last minute. We have to pass a budget by December 14th. We're mandated actually by December 15th in the Home Rule Charter . Now we have 90-some pages of a new document with new numbers . There's no respect for this Council . Again, we take our jobs very -- and I take my job very seriously . We go through this line item by line item. So this will take time. We'll get it done. We will make sure that the public's money is spent and it's spent correctly and the budget is balanced . But my suggestion for next year would be to make sure that everyone reviews this budget and makes sure that there are no mistakes . Everybody in life makes mistakes . But to do it two years in a row at this rate with 134 changes is complete ly and utterly unacceptable . And at this time I'd like to make a motion that City Council send correspondence to the Pennsylvania Economy League detailing our concerns with the budget and asking them to review this new propose d budget to make sure it is, in fact, correct . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? According to Act 199 of 2014, our Act 47 coordinator has a statutory responsibility to review a financial ly distressed municipality 's propose d annual budget. The coordinator according to Act 199 of 2014 may make any necessary modifications to the proposed budget to meet the adopted Recovery Plan or Exit Plan's objectives and return it to the municipal ity with those modifications at least 45 days before the end of the current fiscal year. We receive a letter which I have here in front of me every year since I've been on Council which details whether or not we've met the Exit Plan. This letter now is not good for anything because the numbers have changed so much. So we'll need a new letter from the Pennsylvania Economy League. And I quite frankly would like to ask them how they reviewed this budget since they are our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 financial coordinator and we're suppose d to be out of Act 47 at the end of January of next year.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 72, 2019, AN ORDINANCE AMENDING FILE OF COUNCIL NO. 64 OF 2014 ENTITLED “AN ORDINANCE ADOPTING THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND VIOLATIONS TICKET PROCESS IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON (AS AMENDED )” TO AMEND VIOLATIONS IN SECTION 2; ENFORCEMENT IN SECTION 4; FINES AND PENALTIES IN SECTION 5; FINES AND PENALTIES IN SECTION 6; AND CITATION FINES IN SECTION 7. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-G be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , this came out of the quality of life task force as well as conversations that I've had with Miss Cipriani , and I'm sure she explained when she was in here a few weeks ago to talk with Council . The quality of life tickets have not been working . Before my time it was voted to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 decrease the fee to $25 for quality of life violations . And that was in hopes that people would be more motivate d to pay the fee or correct the issue that they were receiving the fine for and that has not happened . So they've -- the Licensing , Inspections and Permits Department has maintained data and documentation and we have not collect ed any more on -- any more of the fines from people then before. So the people were not motivate d to pay like we had anticipated . And, in fact, it's made it more difficult for us to then bring these violations to the magistrate because magistrates don't seem to want to take up, you know, just $25 that someone owes the City. And so this is -- it's not for the City to make money off of the resident s. This is to in hopes of changing the behavior for the people who are violating the quality of life ordinance and so increases the fees from $25 to $100. And then if it is not paid, then there will be a late fee of 10 percent per week. And then if it's unpaid for 10 days, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 then it will be filed with the magistrate . So we are hoping to get better compliance from the changes to the quality of life ordinance . And I know that there was a citizen who had brought this up and had questioned the City's effectiveness to then enforce the quality of life ordinance , which I know has been an issue in the past. But I believe that really the department has been working to help change that process and improve it. So I feel more comfort able that it will be better enforced . That's all. Thank you. MR.

GAUGHAN : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-B. What is your pleasure ? MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-B pass reading by title. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , first off, I was extremely disappoint ed to see the school board's about face last night on their previous commitment to convert from the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax to the Payroll Preparation Tax. In my opinion , the decision to forego this conversion by the majority of the board not only shows their lack of leadership or logic, it also doesn't reflect actual facts. Board members claim that this conversion was rushed without proper discussion which is misleading at best. This has been a topic of discussion since before I was elected to this Council four years ago starting with its inclusion in the 2017 Exit Plan. Both City and district officials have been discuss ing this conversion in great length over my four years on Council .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 I know this because I was in the majority of these meetings . There's been an exorbitant amount of shared services meeting s, PEL meetings that have included district representative s, meetings between multiple administration s both City and district as well as representatives from this Council and a variety of different board members. The Mayor's tax policy group -- working group has also been talking about this for a year and a half. Two years ago the district tried to balk at this conversion by putting out for referendum. In turn, the voters approve d this conversion by an overwhelming 72 percent of the vote. 72 percent of the voters in this City voted to approve this conversion . And last night the School Board thumbed their nose at that overwhelming majority . Another issue brought up by the board is the estimated 1.1 million one time delay in cash flow that would result in this conversion . This is because the Payroll Prep Tax would transition to quarterly collection instead of lump sum annual payments of the BP 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 Mercantile Tax. That 1.1 million is out of a 195 million dollar budget which comes out to just over 1 half of 1 percent . That is a nonsense excuse, especially since their budget was balanced in spite of that 1.1 million delay in cash flow. But the comment s that angered me the most was when a board member stated that the district needs to only worry about us -- meaning only the district . I got news for them. As long as they want to make this about us versus them, the resident s and taxpayers of the City will be the ones that suffer. We all represent the same constituents . This is about all of us. In my opinion , there are two main residents -- or two main reasons residents keep fleeing the City. One, is the earned income tax which the district gets 1 percent of a total 3.4 percent tax. Two, is the current state of City schools . City residents and taxpayers will continue to suffer until the district and City begin to actually work together as one to begin to address these issues by not only modernizing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 our separate operation s but also by modernizing the taxing system that has been a burden to our taxpayers for far too long. Both the Business Privilege and Mercantile taxes have been labeled nuisance taxes by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania since the late 80s, basically my entire lifetime and could no longer be levied. They are only grandfathered in. There is very little organic growth in either business privilege or Mercantile . And neither is easily collect ible on top of being a burden on our small business community . That's to say there will not be business es that are negatively impacted by this conversion because there will be. But there is only few and it's not because their tax will increase , it's because they haven't been paying any business tax at all because they are exempt from paying BP and Mercantile . But it's our job to assess what's best for all, not a select few. I also don't believe this is a perfect option. But it's the only option we have at the moment. We either make this conversion now or lose the ability to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 do so which is not the case for the school district . According to state law, the City could only make this transition while in Act 47, which we will be leaving in January . The school district can make this conversion at any point. I also have supported and continue to support this conversion because it's a more modern, easily collectible tax. It has greater potential for organic growth as wages increase . It's easier to verify what is owed. It is spread out to cover all businesses in the City. It has to be revenue neutral in year one and the City has the ability to adjust the rate after year one to guarantee that it is revenue neutral . That is why I will be voting to advance and pass this conversion even though we have to do it alone. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : I don't have anything to add but I just wanted to say that I concur with what Councilman Donahue just said. I think he laid it out perfectly .

MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works? MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I'm all about modernization , route efficiency , incorporating technology and cost savings . So I had the opportunity to speak and pose question s to the head of DPW, DPW employees and residents of the City. So based on the conversations I had from all parties and entities , I think that we might be missing something here. There was a pilot done last year for free of data collection . I think we could have taken that data collection , got everybody at the table for free and come up with cost saving plan, you know, based on input for route efficiency and streamlining the process like what's promised by Rubicon. So for them reasons I think we missed an opportunity . We probably still could do this for free if we vote no. So I'm voting no. MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , I'm going to start by saying that I do feel we need digitization . I think it would make some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 things more efficient . When looking at this contract , I would like to first say I've seen this presentation before. Over at the district some similar presentations were propose d and the savings didn't material ize. With the City we have about 15 vehicles that we're looking for and the district had about 50. And we're going to be spending more in year one than the district paid in four years. So I do think with one-fifth of the vehicles , the price may be too much and possibly the timeframe . I'll also be voting no. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? I will be voting yes for this for several reasons . First of all, let me just explain what this does not do because I've heard some concerns over the last few weeks. So it does not mean that employees will be cut from the DPW. If anything , we need more employee s in the DPW. The DPW historically over the years has been decimated because of budget cuts. There is not enough employees in that department to do all of the things that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2599 would like to be done in the City. So there is no question about that. I would not vote for this if I thought and did not get an assurance from Mr. Preambo that there would be positions cut when the program is implement ed and they do find efficiencies . So that's number one. Number two, it does not have anything to do with privatization . I do not agree with privatization of the DPW. I won't be here next year, but I think my colleagues on Council agree with me. Privatization is the wrong way to go. We have a phenomenal Department of Public Works. The employees in that department do an outstanding job. They have a difficult job. This idea of privatization has come up before when I was on Council . And I did some research into it. And actually when you look at some instances of privatization throughout the country when they try to privatize their public works department , they save a little bit in the beginning but in the long run, the service is terrible and they don't save as much as they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25100 say they're going to save. And the service is horrendous . So that's number two. This does not mean privatization . I would not vote for it if it did. Number three, this program will pay for itself according to the analysis . So they are saying that we could save $500,000 in efficiencies after the analysis that was done for -- I forget exactly for how many months. But there was a several month period where an analysis was done on routes and a bunch of different things. So the program pays for itself. The goal I think of any department in the City would be to be more efficient . I think it opens up the opportunities , number one, to hire more people; and number two, to serve the taxpayers and the residents as best we can. And that is to be as efficient as we possibly can. So you have proposed $500,000 in savings and employees are not going to be cut. It does not mean privatization . And it also does not mean that there will be any change to the service that the DPW offers. I was assured this by Mr. Preambo because there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25101 was a concern out there that the DPW would stop picking up larger items and things like that. That is not going to happen. That is not true. He assured me that that would not happen. So you're going to get the same level of service , potentially could be more efficient . I don't see the downside in this. So that is why I will be voting yes. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , last week I had voiced my support for this legislation . And I still support it. We are far behind in the City in terms of technology . And I believe this is a good enhancement for our DPW. I appreciate the work that our DPW does. But if you like -- this will only help us to improve and enhance that work and so I don't have any issues with it. I feel that I feel satisfied with the questions that were asked last week and answered by Mr. Preambo and the additional information that he sent over to us. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else?

DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'll be voting yes for this. I did have reservations last week. But I feel like the caucus tonight was very helpful . This piece of legislation that authorizes the ARPA funding is extremely complicated as we all know from having discussion s about it over the last few months. So when you look at the guidance and the final rules that are still pending , I do think that it is in the City's best interest to make sure that we have a service at our disposal to make sure that when the funding has been expended we have followed every rule to a "T." Because if we don't, we will find ourselves in trouble or paying the money back. So we want to make sure although there is a cost to this, we want to make sure that this is done in the best way, the most efficient way. I looked at the backup contract . This company 's being used in many other cities throughout the country . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25104 I think it's the smart, most efficient way to handle this.
