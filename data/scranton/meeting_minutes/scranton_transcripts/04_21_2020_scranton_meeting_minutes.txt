Council will continue to accept public comment until the day of our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 meeting Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. Public comment is reviewed by the Council prior to our meeting and is placed on the official record and in the minutes of our meeting s. Council 's agenda is being posted for public review the Friday before our Tuesday meeting . Our agenda and minutes can be accessed by going to www.scrantonpa .gov and clicking on the City Council page. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MRS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'd ask if someone could please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individual s to be placed into the record and our official minutes of this meeting. MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Is there a second? DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. On the question ? Okay, on the question , those individuals who have submitted public comment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 are Fay Franus, Norma Jeffries , Marie Schumacher and Tom Edwards . We did receive all of their comments this afternoon -- earlier this morning and this afternoon . I have them right here with me. We have -- I have reviewed all of the comments and I know my Council colleagues have as well. So what I am going to do again is to make sure that any of these questions that have been posed to Council get to the proper department in the administration . And then we will -- as soon as we get the answers to them, we will give those answers to members of the public. And these will be made part of our official minutes and part of the record. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mrs. Reed? (Public Comment )1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 (FAY FRANUS) I would like to know why I have NOT received any replies from one council person to my questions since March 31st meeting ? What possible reason do you have for not responding ? You all chose to be public servants . My question is--when will you start doing so? Fay Franus (NORMA JEFFRIES ) 2 items from me if I can get a response : 1) I checked the Monday and Tuesday Legal Announcements , and do not see any posting for the upcoming meetings . Has this changed ? 2) The article in the Times Tribune Monday April 20, 2020 regarding Kiosks: Kiosks coming downtown but timing is a little unsure. Tentative locations have been ID'd. Since this project has not been on anyone's radar for 18 months, I am sure Mayor Cognetti and Council President , Mr. Gaughan will take a good look as to whether this is really a good addition to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 the city. I know that this could raise revenue for the city, but only if the advertisers find it generates more business . I just think it is bad timing and know that the Mayor and Council will take another look at the contract . In addition , the selected locations of these Kiosks raises a few questions for me: A) are these really the best locations ? B) are there numbers to support these selections ? 3) Since these Kiosks will be operational 24/7, I wonder just how much usage will they receive on weekends . Possibly this project should be included with the Walkability Study that is coming. Norma Jeffries City Resident . (MARIE SCHUMACHER ) #1 To clear up an apparent misreading : I requested the CONTRACTUAL due date of the HRG Contract product and nothing more... So again I ask what is the contractual delivery date of the HRG contract report? #1 When will Council begin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 discussing Operating Budget Expense cut(s) and possible additional Revenue sources ? #2 Does overtime affect employees pensions ? #3 Do street sweepers have odometers and, if they do, what is the reading on the two new street sweepers ? #4 Are expenditures related to the (former) Serrenti property off the books? If the expenses related to the Serrenti property are part of the Operating Budget what accounts have been impacted by this acquisition and in what amount(s). #5 Please explain the following Police Department 2018 expenditure increases over those of 2014: Dollars Standard Salaries 732,387 Other Salary (Misc.) 227,681 Professional Services 18,628 City Pension 9,047,506 Service & Main. Fees 30,960 Training & Certification 40,325 Capital Expenses 254,959 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 (TOM EDWWARDS ) Can Council address next years property taxes? No one is working and then we're just going to be expected to plop down full payment ?? It needs to be addressed to the public by council . Even if there is no plan yet. Also...Citizens participation questions should be aired. 20 minute time limit. Thank you Tom (END OF PUBLIC COMMENT ) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments at this time? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. MCANDREW : No, not at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : And, Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. DONAHUE : Just briefly I want to urge residents to continue to stay home to practice social distancing to only go out if you absolutely need to. I know we're all anxious to get back to normal. I know I am. But, you know, it's not about, you know, whether -- I know from my perspective I've had this conversation with Councilman Gaughan this afternoon . The scariest part about this virus to me is that you could have it and not show symptoms . So whether or not, you know, you survive -- I might be able to survive it. You know, everyone else might be able to survive it; but, you know, we might be giving it to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 someone who can't. So I think we have to just continue to practice what we've been practicing . And I urge everyone to observe patience in that. I know it's not easy to do. But I think it needs to be done for the betterment of everybody else. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I just have a few comments . First, Council received an update from Art Moretti today on the gas card audit report. This is something that really has been evolving over the past few months. Mr. Moretti reported to Council today that the draft report is complete and has been sent out for final review. Final review is a two-day process which includes review of the schedules , work papers and narratives . Should there be no significant issues, Mr. Moretti expects to release the report on Friday. Council had previously requested Mr. Moretti 's participation in a future meeting once the report was received . So if Council does receive that report Friday, I had asked in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 caucus to have Mr. Moretti in for our caucus next Tuesday so that we can have him present that report and ask any questions . And certainly if we receive it Friday, that will be placed in Third Order on our agenda so the public could review that as well. So that's an update on the gas card situation . The other thing that I just wanted to mention , for anyone in the public that has any questions at this time regarding City operations or the City's coronavirus response , anything really related to the coronavirus , you could send those requests and those questions to Scranton 311@scrantonpa .gov or you can call 570-348-4101. The Mayor and her administration have set up this system to field any sort of questions on any of the operations of the City at this time and our response to the coronavirus pandemic . Also on the City's website Scranton pa.gov, there are a number of lists of resources for people who are in need of food or shelter , help with their utilities , services for veterans, so on and so forth. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 So if you have access to a computer , please utilize the City's website . There is a ton of information on there. And if you don't have access to the computer you could call, again, 570-348-4101. As Councilman Donahue mentioned , I just want to caution people again in the City to please follow the guidelines set forth by our medical professionals here in the state. Governor Wolf has extended the shelter -in-place order until May 8th, which we all know. And we have to follow this for the safety of not only ourselves but of everybody else. The news of the amount of deaths in the nursing homes is just -- I can't even -- there are no words for it and the heartache that goes along with that. So we need to again, not only worry about ourselves but worry about everybody else. I could not believe my eyes yesterday when I saw the utter selfishness and ignorance of people gathered in large crowds down in Harrisburg to protest Governor Wolf's orders. Every single one of us wants to get back to normal and eventually we will. But for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 now we have to stay home. We have to stay away from large crowds as much as we possibly can. For the most part from what I've seen, the people of Scranton have done a relatively good job in listening in to the guideline s and the shelter -in-place order. But we can't become complacent . And, you know, my concern is -- and I talked to the Mayor extensively about this that, you know, on May 8th everyone thinks that they can just go out and go back to normal. It's going to be a gradual process hopefully . But this isn't a one size fits all situation . And we can't treat it like that. So we need to continue to do our part. We need to continue to have hope as well although that is difficult . There are a number of agencies . There are a number of people in our City that are out there willing to help you if you have mental health issues or if you're in need of food or shelter , please call the number that I gave you before or go to scrantonpa .gov or send your questions or concerns to Scranton 311@scrantonpa .gov and someone will put 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 you in the right place for that because , you know, I just went for a ride with my wife and kids just to get out of the house yesterday . And you see people walking around and you wonder if they are in the same situation as I am where we can order food and have it deliver ed to our house. There's many people in our City who can't do that. There's many people in nursing homes who haven't seen their family. There's many elderly people who live by themselves . So we need to look out for each other during this crisis. And I think that we are. We're doing a good job with that and I hope that we will continue to do that. And I'm confident that we will get through this. MR. DONAHUE : I think Bill froze there for a minute. So we'll give him a minute to get back. MR. GAUGHAN : I'm frozen again, yeah. I don't know where I left off. MR. DONAHUE : It was right at the end if you want to -- MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, well, all I'm saying is -- yeah. Thank you. I was just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 saying that, you know, as long as we continue to do our part, I'm confident that we can get through this crisis. And before I freeze again I'll shut up and we can move on. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. No business at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. If there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : This meeting is adjourned . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Hold on. I think Kevin wants to -- MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, sorry, Kevin. You're muted. ATTY. HAYES: Did you announce the executive session ? MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, yes, I'm sorry. I have that written down over here. Council did have an executive session -- so we -- Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 had an executive session at 4:30 today for the purpose of obtaining updates from the City's labor solicitor on personnel matters and litigation . And now that I think of it too, Mrs. Reed, this was advertised in the newspaper as well, correct ? MS. REED: Yes, it was in the Sunday edition of the Times. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. All right. Okay. Thank you. And thank you for reminding me, Kevin. I appreciate that. Okay, if there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. DONAHUE : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : This meeting is adjourned . Stay safe. Stay health. See everybody next week.
