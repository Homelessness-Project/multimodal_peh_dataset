SCRANTON MUNICIPAL RECREATION AUTHORITY SEPTEMBER 2024 MEETING MINUTES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 RECEIVED OCTOBER 10, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: Just I'd like to thank all the volunteers who helped with the Steamtown Marathon this past weekend . It was a big success . We had 1,100 registered . We had 904 finishers . They came from 38 states and a total of nine countries . We had a tremendous amount of help. It was a rainy day. But policemen , firemen , citizen volunteers , EMS workers up and down the valley through 14 communities welcomed these runners from all over the country . And I think we put a great show on. A lot of people ran great times. A lot of people qualified for the Boston Marathon . And it was very successful . So I want to thank the entire Steamtown Marathon Committee who help volunteer for the past 27 years make it a big success . That's about it. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. MR. SCHUSTER : One announcement , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 next week 10/24, so October 24th at 6 p.m., they are going to have a meeting on the Keyser Valley stormwater . It's going to be at 6 p.m. So I will make another announcement next week to get a reminder , but Keyser Valley stormwater . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay, so next week's public caucus, Tuesday , October 22nd at 5:45, we will have Fitch and Associates and members of the city's administration for discussion and to answer questions from Council regarding the emergency medical services feasibility study within the City of Scranton . Also, the Catherine McAuley Center will take Halloween costumes new or gently used. Donations can be dropped off at the administration office this Monday through Friday, 9 to 5 on 530 Pittston Avenue. I know everybody has some costumes laying around in their attic. I know I do. So they really need them. And then Victor Alferi Club will be doing a dine in or take out over in West Side. All are welcome . Bring a friend, feed a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 friend. They're doing this one week early.

The price is $12 for members and 14 for nonmembers . And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . DR. ROTHCHILD : I have another to add. We received information on this trunk or treat event. I know there's a lot this time around. I figured I'd mention this one. I'm not sure if anyone had already , but the Elm Park Methodist Church that is on Linden Street down near the University of Scranton , they're going to be having a trunk or treat. That's Saturday , October 26th from 1 to 3. And the rain date is the following day. So you'll be able to fill your bags with goodies or the kids will. And they'll have entertainment , building tours. So that should be a fun family event. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I want to start by compliment ing DPW and the police department for the fine work they did working the Steamtown Marathon , which they do every year. I was the race director for the Army's New Mountain marathon at Fort Huachuca for the two years I was the battalion commander . And I know exactly how much work goes into the planning and execution of an event like that. All you see is what happens on race day. But it's a year long effort. And it takes cooperation of a lot of people. And the nice thing is, you know, it reflect s so well on the city and the residents and the police and DPW and other people. Even though the weather was kind of lousy in the morning , you know, the volunteers were just very up, you know, the runners were happy. It was just a very successful event. So I congratulate you, Mr. King, and everyone who supported you in that. I saw on the news that there was something like 2,000 volunteers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 to execute . I know what that's like. And, you know, of course, I had -- I had people that didn't have to volunteer . I had soldiers . It's a little different than when I did it. But anyway it was a great event. The collective bargaining agreement s, so we're still waiting on the police contract , correct ? MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, because I just want to be sure that I didn't miss it somewhere in the website . MR. SMURL: No, the only thing that was updated were all the arbitration awards. So it's still the old contract with all the arbitration awards. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, okay, okay, I'll be watching for it. And we're still negotiating the DPW contract because that ends at the end of this year. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : So hopefully that will -- I hope that that's completed before that contract runs out. They did it the last time. Maybe they could pull that off again. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 And keep in mind, you know, that even though it might not be completed that as you do the 2025 budget, eventually any pay raises will hit that budget. So if it's -- it may be just like with police and firefighter s. And you have to back date it to, you know, the first of the year. That's why it's so important that these things be done on a more timely basis because it's to no one's advantage to go back a year or two. Let's see, when Vice President Harris or former President Trump, when they come to town or their Vice Presidential candidates , who picks up the tab for the security and other arrangements ? Do we get paid later or do we just suck it up? MR. SMURL: City of Scranton bills all of the candidate s. Every candidate gets billed. MS. HODOWANITZ : Do they honor the bills? Do they pay? MR. SMURL: I don't know of any that have paid. I know the smaller ones like Bill's race, they all pay. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, well, it can't be cheap, especially , you know, in this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 contentious election year. And it's a heightened threat environment . And, you know, I don't object to the fact that, you know, we go that extra mile but it's got to cost some money. There's got to be a lot of overtime and other issues. And I hope we get down the road reimbursed for the cost because they seem to be coming back and back and back and back. And, you know, in my mind, once is enough, you know? MR. SMURL: We do bill them. MS. HODOWANITZ : Don't come back kind of thing. What's the status of the city's audit? Are we still waiting on the Scranton Parking Authority ? MR. SMURL: Parking authority , yes, yes. I don't know -- well, because City Hall was closed yesterday , I -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Does anybody have any idea when their next -- the Parking Authority 's next scheduled meeting is? Go down there and rattle a few doors. MR. SMURL: Yeah, their last one was September 25th.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MS. HODOWANITZ : So they do a quarterly ? MR. SMURL: I believe -- it must be quarterly , yeah. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. But they're not getting a Christmas card this year because they're the one bottleneck holding it up. They know better. This is not the first time they were late. So I don't know what their game is, but hopefully when new members have to get appoint ed we get some more cooperative people appoint ed. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Ronnie Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, Council , believe it or not, lately I've been listening instead of talking . What I hear isn't the best, of course. One parent complained her son -- and this is sort of surprising to me. Her son is voting democratic because he believes that democrats stand for socialism , drugs, and abortions . This -- this seems to be an underlying reason when you talk to some younger people, that's bad. There's no thinking of 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 or 20 years from now even in ads you see for different people. I don't know why abortion is such an issue anyway. I believe it's to get so many people's minds off of all the adversities happening in this country at this present time. I think -- I think a lot of people just fear the truth, the facts and don't want to hear bad news. I'll give you a fact here. From 1973 to 2021, there was 625,000 legal abortions . Now does that sound like we need Planned Parenthood? They are out there if somebody needs one, they're available evidently . You could look in your computer and see the only people that really need Planned Parenthood seem that all the pregnant people want to use abortion for birth control at taxpayer 's expense . I'll give you another fact. Look up Harris's miraculous overnight rise in California politics under her mentor Willy Brown. She had no history . She had no record whatsoever that she's telling people on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 the commercials that she did. This is during her administration , not before it. You know, I heard yesterday she was complaining about Mr. Trump's mental state. She stood next to the President for four years and never had any mention of his health problems . I'd like to see what Harris would do in a debate with Janet Evans, Mrs. Cummings , Mrs. Walsh, Fanucci , Miss Gatelli , Jessica up there, Joan and Marie. I think she'd fail miserably . I can't imagine anyone being so naive and so ignorant that they believe the power behind the presidency are going to allow this woman to have any authority if they win. And lastly, how about Walz, a good officer leads his men, a sniffling coward knowing his command is being activated and going to war would drop out a month or two as he did before they leave. I'm a veteran . And I think I could comment on this miserable wretched , obnoxious action of his. He's definitely a coward. And how could -- how could you expect someone like that to lead troops if something happened to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Harris. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . You know as -- Mark, thank you for the donations . What we're doing is, we're going to continue it through this week and the end of next week. And then I'm done with it. I've already shipped five trailer loads of donated foods and stuff that we've donated , disinfected wipes that I donated with my fellow masons and other people have gone down to Florida and North Carolina . So if we can't fill this trailer out, we'll take whatever we have that's been donated to us and give it to another group and they could take care of it. And the one thing that he brought up about abortions , I don't think that should be an issue in this country over who gets elected to office. Abortion is a personal thing. If somebody wants to murder a baby, there should be a law against it. It's no different than somebody putting a gun to somebody 's head and raping them and murdering them. So it may be a choice if it depends on the mother's life, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 incest or other things that are -- that are pertinent . It may be acceptable , but not just as a form of birth control that we start murdering babies. It's got to come to an end. And that can't be the issue of this campaign . This campaign 's got to be about all Americans , our safety, closing borders and doing the things that are necessary , getting us back on track that Joe Biden and Harris took us off. The gas wells, the drilling , all the other stuff that's gone done, the high cost of living and everything that we're facing. What bothered me this time is President Trump came to Scranton , and I want to mention our police department and the State Police. They did one hell of a job protect ing not only the President , but everybody that attended his rally here in Scranton . But what disturbed me most is none of our local officials , county commissioners , Gaughan , McGloin , nobody went to greet him. I thought when you became a public official that it was your job to represent all the people whether it was against their political 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 affiliation . It didn't make a difference . Everybody became neutral . And I'm offended by the fact that we didn't greet him. Yet when sleepy Joe came to Scranton , everybody went crazy. Yet, he turned into be coward and walked away and let his party destroy him. And he turned around and let Harris, the phoney liar get in and tampon Tim to run and yet people run out and greet them. Why don't we greet Trump? What are we going to do if he does become president ? Are we going to ignore him then, but everybody will want something done. Nobody's talking about the Biden administration and the people in Florida . And I'm down in Florida . I have interest in Florida . And we have been hit by the hurricane down there on Anna Maria Island and also. They're not doing a damn thing for the people down there that have been devastated through the Carolinas and all. That's what our government should do. And Joe doesn't even know where North Carolina is let alone what they're going to do to get things done. And it's a disappointment .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 The other thing I think people should understand is that Trump donated his salary. He didn't take it. He donated it. He did a lot for this country and we don't have that right now. People say why are you wearing that shirt, Bolus? Because I believe Donald Trump is alive today, not because of the Secret Service or any of the police that were around there. I believe it was divine intervention and I believe Jesus Christ was involve d in it because he wanted somebody to be around here to straighten this country out where it's going. The other thing that we have here and I'm looking at 7-A, you know what it costs to buy a garbage truck and we're going to rent it out? Who's going to drive it? Who's going to repair it? And who's going to ensure it? And how much money are we going to make on our investment in that garbage truck, the cost of fuelling and everything else. I didn't see any of that. I'm a former freightliner , Brockway (inaudible ) and Volvo dealer. And I've had over 600 trucks. I know what the cost of operation is. But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 don't see any of this. But yet we're giving them 140 or $150,000 garbage truck. During La Festa, the city let the truck sit there day and night, never shut it off, kept idling, idling, burning fuel. For what purpose , to block the Trump trailer . And that's the problem we have. We're not here using our head and taking care of our assets. And last of all, I just want to thank you guys for being the Council members that you are that you respect , you don't stop anybody from free speech. And you're to be commended for it. But next time President Trump comes to town, say hello. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Alan Lucas. MR. LUCAS: Good evening , Council , Alan Lucas, Scranton resident , President of the IFF Local 60 representing the Scranton firefighters . I'm here today to address the introduction , the study regarding future of Scranton Fire Department Station Engine 10. Engine 10 is currently located at the top of East Mountain where it was built in the 1960s. This placement is intentional . Five stations throughout the city are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 strategically located to ensure the fastest possible response times. Engine 10 serves as the first due engine for East Mountain , upper South Side, Dutch Hallow meaning it's the first apparatus to arrive on scene in these areas. Additionally , Engine 10 is second due to the Hill Section providing critical water supply and support for emergencies . East Mountain is also home to Mountain Lake and Lake Scranton , both of which have had multiple water emergencies and water rescues performed by the fire department . The closure of Engine 15 in the city's Hill Section has increased Engine 10's workload making its continued operation even more essential . As we often say in the fire service , seconds matter during an emergency . Delays in response time can mean the difference between containing a fire and experiencing a catastrophic loss. We've already seen the impact when Engine 10 was out of service . The last time the station was temporarily closed a fire broke out on Froude Street on East Mountain . Without Engine 10 available , Engine 2 stationed 2.2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 miles had to respond . What should have been a 4 minute arrival time turned into 10 minute or longer response . As a result, what could have been a fire contained to the garage spread to the house causing significant damage. Recognizing the importance of Engine 10, the city reopened the station in that area the next day. The threat of fire on East Mountain extends beyond the residents to local businesses as well. Waldorf Park housing 100 year old building stands today thanks to the quick response of firefighters station ed on the mountain . According to Waldorf Park President , Harold Bower, we had a small kitchen fire here where our kitchen burned. If it was not for the fire truck up here on East Mountain getting here so quickly , the whole building would have been lost. But they were able to get it knocked down fast. In addition to strategic location , geography places a crucial role in response times. East Mountain 's steep terrain , particularly during inclement weather can delay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 response times if resources aren't stationed nearby. While it may be slower to travel downhill , we know that we could always make it down. That isn't always the case going up, especially when time is of the essence . Keeping Engine 10 on East Mountain ensures our firefighters can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies no matter what the weather conditions . Beyond respond time challenges , the current Engine 10 station is outdated and inadequate for both operation and living purposes . The building lacks the space necessary to meet the needs of modern firefighting . Over time the equipment we carry has increase d but the station has not kept up pace. With more gear, tools, and personnel , the cramped quarters present challenges for firefighters living and working there. Engine 10 also often receive s an older hand-me-down apparatus from other stations further emphasizing the need for a properly equipped and functional station to support operations .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 So on behalf of Local 60, I respectfully urge that any study or decision regarding Engine 10 fully considers the vital role it plays at its current location , not just for the residents and businesses of East Mountain , but for the entire city. To ensure public safety and the safety of our firefighters , Engine 10 must remain at or near its current location . I thank you for time and consideration . And I especially thank the members of Council that took the time out of your schedules to meet with us outside of these grounds and hear our concerns . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Lucas. That's all for our sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I completely agree with the fire station being where it is. It was there for a reason. I'm well aware of being back in Minooka and coming up even Pittston Avenue and the Cedar Avenue hill back in the 60s or 70s and hoping to get up to the top when it's covered with snow and ice and sliding to the side a little bit and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 bumping off the curbs just so you didn't go all the way back down to the bottom of the hill or into people behind you. Having a fire station in a high ground in a place to respond quickly is imperative especially as he mentioned in inclement weather . I look at the document here 5-B, the only thing I find confusing about it is I have no problem with the grants. I believe for the design and the placement of it, the fire department should be the primary consulting for where its operation should be since it's the one that has to go out and actually take care of fires and store the equipment , not people in offices or City Hall or consultants . I look at this and it says they want to do a predesign and then following the predesign, a design. They need a study to study a design to then get a design based upon what they predesigned . And then after that rather having the contractor who made the design responsible for actually perform ing and doing a competent job, it seems we need a construction oversight position to oversight 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 the construction that they were already contracted to do. It seems like there is a lot of extra layers of digging in and giving money to people that aren't directly into the process of actually building or constructing this. So multiple layers I do have a concern with. It seems to be a bit abusive . Mr. Voldenberg , I would like to thank you for providing a copy of the Home Rule Charter . I got a chance to look over it and it was a good way of clearing up some information , including some information that I was incorrect about. The Charter provides for only a few positions that are required for city residents , those are the Mayor, City Council , and City Controller all have to be residents of the city for at least one year beforehand and have continuous city residency . Those are the only specific ones by the Charter . Other laws may have been passed by ordinances that have increase d that one in the past, but those restrictions from the Charter were not originally there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Recyclables , we're now up to $15,941 that we have thrown away by sending recyclables to recycling center and then having them move over to the dumps for $120 a ton versus $47. So it's a do nothing loss of 15, almost $16,000 now. And it will continue to add up for as long as we do nothing and say we'll wait for someone to make a decision . DeNaples originally had a -- it was zero dollars until Covid struck and he couldn't get the one dollar free labor from the prisons , which he's getting sued for because the one dollar that the county set up for him is illegal because you're only allowed to pay the one dollar fee if they were working for Unicorp and on prison property . They should have been getting minimum wage. So it moved from 1 dollar to 40 dollars for the recycling because he could no longer pay prisoners one dollar an hour for the process . Now it's probably moved up to 120 because he's going to have to pay the back pay on all of those civil suits. So we're now jumping up to 120, not only because he's not making as much but he's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 going to have to pay the piper in the end. That's pretty much all I have to say tonight because there's a lot of problems in the city that could be resolved if people actually stepped forward and moved the process rather someone else waiting to move the ball. Seems to be a lot of resistance . And unfortunately as citizens , we have very little control over that except for our voice. Thank you and good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Virgil Argenta . I hope you paid attention to Mr. Lucas who is a professional . Who knows best about fire service , but a firefighter . Let's not forget the double nickel also protects there's a nursing home up on the mountain and the Howard Gardner School. So now why are project s put out to bid in the City of Scranton when you do not take the lowest bidder? Is the City of Scranton so financial ly well off that the city administration does not take the lowest bidder even when it's close to $600,000 lower? For instance , the Capouse Avenue Splash Pad 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Project , this project was bid out by a local licensed city contractor with experience in splash pad construction . For the record, the first bid, the low bidder was under 2 million dollars . It was submitted by a local long time experience licensed City of Scranton contract or with experience in splash pad construction . The company that the city is trying to accept to do the work is from outside the City of Scranton . And their bid was 2.3 million plus which is at least $600,000 more than the lowest bidder. Are we that well off in the City of Scranton ? Does anybody know? The bid was not accepted and it was thrown out and it was put up for a rebid. Six other contractors were part of the rebid process . Once again, the local licensed City of Scranton contractor was once again the low bidder. To our surprise , the City of Scranton awarded the bid to the highest bidder from outside of the city. Does that surprise anybody ? So can anyone explain to us why a bid for $600,000 plus more would be accepted ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 And for the record, what are the rules of engagement for bidding out project s in the City of Scranton ? Or wait a minute, do we just make them as we go along? This is the third bid that we are aware of where something is not adding up with the bidding process for the City of Scranton . Let that be for the record. We have an awful lot of lawsuits filed by contractor s against the City of Scranton and who made an awful lot of money. Do we need another injunction filed on another project ? Can we afford another lawsuit ? Can we afford a delay, another project pertaining to the activities for our youth? Now, regarding the Novembrino splash pad issue where the rubber matting is lifting , the splash pad contractor , just so you guys are all aware, did not do that. A city vendor did it. The contractor also advised the city and I'm sure it's in writing not to put the matting down for a year so that the concrete would have a chance to cure. Mr. Smurl, I'm sure you're aware of concrete and curing. But the Mayor insisted to rush the job so that the splash pad could be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 used and she would look good. We can all bet that the Mayor failed to mention the fact to wait one year before the rubber coating went down. Thank you, Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , resident of East Mountain very close to the firehouse . Can anybody tell me how much revenue we're going to get from the Serrenti building this year? MR. SMURL: I don't believe there's any revenue at all. MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon? MR. SMURL: Zero. I don't think there's any at all. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, well, then let's certainly make sure for next year that there is because the Mayor when she wanted to buy the Serrenti said that it would provide revenue . And if it doesn't, we should put it on the market. Now pilots, we talk about the local ones. But there is a Chapter 69 of Title 31 of the United States Code that where the law recognizes the financial impact of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 inability of local governments to -- my writing -- to call the property taxes on federally owned land. So why are we not doing that? Why are we not asking the Department of the Interior to provide pilot? MR. SMURL: I don't know. MS. SCHUMACHER : For the Chamberlain , at least I think that's a sizeable chunk of land. And then again with Engine 10, there's another thing that's there. There's a lot of population on that East Mountain . And there is four ways to get there. And that's it. So that really makes a big difference . You either come up River Street or you go in Seymour or I forget the name of the other one down there. MR. KING: Linwood , I think. MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon? MR. KING: Linwood , yeah, by the nursing home, that's Linwood . And there is Seymour and Snook. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, whatever happened to Wawa? MR. SMURL: I don't know where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 that -- why it stalled or where it's at right now. MS. SCHUMACHER : Is there -- when we give a variance to somebody , is there a certain length of time that they -- that is useable ? MR. SMURL: I don't know what the zoning gave or if they did approve the whole project . I'm not sure of all of that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, according to them, I think it was two years ago last August or this August, '94 -- yeah, '24. And again, I'll have to ask that whenever we do the budget this year we take into consideration what the county did today which was to increase the taxes for 33 -- by 33 percent . And we can only take so much. That's it for tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Marie. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is, you know, I think that the Engine 10 debate should end and that station should be maintained no matter what happens here because of the public safety issue and just how important it is. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 And I don't think there's much more to be said on that because taxpayers pay taxes for a reason. And it's to have their interest protected . And I don't know if you could see that, but I just want to add something because I agree with what everybody said about that engine company . But the other thing I have here is, you know, there's a big -- well, maybe it's not a big debate. But there's a discussion going on in the community to some degree about the County Commissioners ' meeting and Mr. Bolus. But, you know, when you watch the tape that ECTV has put together , I'm just curious as to why they edit the meeting to remove certain parts of it in regards to the events that took place at that meeting ? Now, I mean, I'm only speaking for myself but, I mean, I do have ECTV in federal court because of the way they conduct their business . I believe the Mayor and the Council are responsible for that. As a matter of fact, ECTV tried to question whether they should be in federal court. So then I decided , well, maybe I should 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 take them to county court too since we're going to have a party. We might as well let everybody come to the party including the county judges because evidently that case is locked tight. And I really look forward to discovery and bringing witnesses in. I intend to bring the five Council members there and the Mayor and former Council members . And I've asked your clerk for information on formation of that channel . I hope he took me very serious . I just think the residents of the city have to realize one thing, they've allowed city government to play politics . Other speaker got up and spoke about why people didn't come to see Mr. Trump. Well, this has been a town of political democrats for almost forever and they've looted this city continually over my entire lifetime . And they really have ignored worthy project s to pass more graft onto anybody they could. So when they question what's going on at the splash park at Novembrino and the contract s that come through here and all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 grant money, it's just one form of graft after another . And there's no desire on the part of the Council to investigate anything because you remember what happened at the inspections department , the lady that made the accusations moved outside the city and took her family with her because of how corrupt this government is. But yet, still the resident s keep voting for it because , well, you know, you just can't fix stupid. They just don't understand because they've been led uneducated and have no desire to see the truth. And on the abortion issue, it's not even a federal issue. It's a state issue. But it's the only issue that the democrats have to bring people to the polls because they are a complete failure . And the republican party, it was taken over by ordinary working people like myself as you could see with the teamsters going with the voting, the rank and file is going to vote for Trump but the top guy won't endorse . And then other unions where the rank and file is Trump supporter s and the leadership 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 of the union is going with the democrats . It's graft. It's corruption . And the American people can't take anymore even in organized labor. And when you look at abortion , I think people need to look at studies and history because almost nobody lived into adolescence and out the other side of it before about 1800. Almost all the children died before they were 16 years old. That's why (inaudible ) people had families of eight and ten people. And when you look at women, you have to ask them one question . You can't stop being intimate with someone for a couple days while you're ovulating so the only answer you have is to kill your children ? And I don't know how anybody -- well, anybody could kill their own children . And, you know, abortion is nothing more than killing your children . And anybody who sees it any other way I respect your opinion , but it's not factual . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening, Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tonight I'm going to start by speaking about Engine 10 up on East Mountain . I remember that fire up at Waldorf Park Social Club and the quick response by Engine 10. In a matter of 3 minutes they were actually inside the building working on getting it put out. It's an older building . And it really would have went up quickly if Engine 10 wasn't there. We never also should have closed Engine 15. Response times for our older building s and older structures are extremely important . Safety to the city is extremely important . Crosswalks to the city are extremely important where people use stop signs as yields. They don't come to a complete stop. Imagine if there was a crosswalk there, somebody not from the area would actually slow them down quite a bit. We don't have crosswalks in our school zones. We don't have 15 mile an hour signs in our school zones. We don't have crosswalks for people on Sundays and Saturdays that go to church. We don't have them at funeral homes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 We don't have them at major thoroughfares . You know, safety is extremely important . Over the weekend we had quite a few police calls, heart-wrenching , Friday, Saturday , Sunday and then again today. There was a minor that was stabbed over by Wendy's earlier today. Thank goodness the perpetrator is in custody . But that doesn't stop what happened . You know, it's easy to say that they are isolated incident s, but they're also incidents because they affect everybody here in Scranton , people that are from here, people that truly care, people that want to make a difference . You know, we've heard from quite a few people tonight , quite a few subjects . The matter is, they take time out of their schedule . They come up here and they speak their mind. And I'm very respectful for that. There's not as many people as there should be to come out and speak their mind at local affairs like this one. I think that this coming election next November for local officials is extremely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 important because the decision maker makes a difference . And when you have those below this administration that are not from here, they can't make informative decision s based upon experience , experience s in life living in Scranton , growing up in Scranton , knowing what Scranton 's about and its people. You just set yourself up for failure. We've done that once again by promoting that Parks Director to DPW. You know, Scott Gassenmeyer is not the answer. If you have one pool and you are over budget at the end of September , there's a problem . You're giving him more money to work with, more people to work with. And it's not a solution . It becomes an additional problem . We could do better. You know, I spend a lot of time on the weekends trying to help others because that's what I'm good at, the kindness in my heart, being humbled by everybody you speak with, the people you get to know over the years. So I spend some time at the Washburn Street Cemetery . I know a lot of families that have loved ones that are in that cemetery . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Unfortunately , the Mayor only knows one family that's been impacted. And when you're not from here, this is what you get. You know, we could do better. We could make Scranton great again. We could make a difference . I truly believe that in life there are things that you can change and things that you can try to change and things that you cannot change. You know, at one time Scranton was a wonderful city. Our current climate, these calls, the poor decision making and wanting to spend $350,000 on a study. Ask Al Lucas, knows from the Scranton Fire Department , they're the ones that know what they need. And come election day next year, I think the City of Scranton knows what they need, a change. Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just I know we're going to consider that study tonight for East 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Mountain . And I'm pretty sure that all five of us are interested in seeing the Engine 10 stay on East Mountain . We're going to probably pass a resolution or introduce a resolution this evening that authorize s the study and some predesign and design construction oversight for a new Engine 10. I'm hoping that all of us will at least introduce it tonight and make an amendment to ensure that there is language put into it before it goes to sixth order next week that indicates that any construction of a new firehouse for engine or replacement for Engine 10 happens either in the existing spot or in close proximity to where it is now. Lessons learned from the past. There's a reason why that was placed there. As was pointed out earlier , a very tragic fire occurred when that Engine 10 was closed down for 18 months. And all of a sudden it was opened back up again. So I'm going to be supporting that this evening . I believe the fire department supports the actual study for the design because we need that in order to ensure that, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 you know, it's not like the old days. There are so many new requirements for new fire departments and fire stations that the studies like this are required . And we would be using a LSA Grant to support that study so I'm all for that. Something was mentioned earlier this evening that President Biden doesn't know where the Carolinas are. Well, he apparently did on October 2nd when he went to visit the Carolinas and he met with North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. And he told Governor Cooper that the federal government will cover 100 percent of all debris removal and emergency protective measure cost for six months. So I just wanted to correct the record when things are said that aren't correct . I think it's important that facts come out. So that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few comments . So while we're on Engine 10, thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 you, Mr. Lucas, coming in giving us a rundown, a history , the needs in that area and why the station is in that location . I did have a chance to see the station . And I have seen it in the past as well. From looking at the area, it seems like a new modern fire station that meets our needs can be erected in that same location if not nearby. So as Mr. King said, we will be moving this from fifth order, but prepare for some amendments to that to make that language work for the East Mountain community . One address I had, Mr. Voldenberg , I also spoke about in caucus was 519 Dickens Street. We followed up on it a few times. One of the resident s had a concern about a basin there. We did get an e-mail that someone would go out. I did notice that one call at least was made and the area was painted. But if we could just follow up as to timeline of events that will occur there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. I had some questions over the last two meeting s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 inquiring into some of the refuse trucks. We did lease two refuse trucks from '21 to '22. And while we were purchasing our new refuse trucks, so I just wanted to make sure that we weren't current ly leasing any trucks for our fleet. That ended in May of 2023. I inquired about a gateway sign that's going to be located on North Main Avenue near Euclid Avenue as to whether that was going to be placed for the Tripp Park community or West Scranton . And that's going to be a marker for the West Scranton community . While we're on refuse trucks, Mr. King asked the administration to confirm 30 days for borrow of the city refuse truck. He inquired if the city may confirm that the Scranton School District named the city additionally insured on the insurance policy for that allotted timeframe . So the original term of the contract is through September 30th with an option to extend for an additional six months. Scranton School District is require d to maintain adequate casualty , public liability and property insurance coverage for the duration of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 the lease at their own expense . So they are picking up that expense on the refuse truck that they will borrow. Thanks. Next up, I had some questions about recycling . So I asked if there was an updated meeting that had occurred with the recycling program . And the city administration said that they had met with a representative of Lackawanna County Recycling Center. They explained that the issues with the contaminated commingled recycling material received from county municipalities -- was also received from county municipalities including Scranton . The issues are not a new problem , but the Recycling Center, Incorporated , decided in August to raise that rate to $120 a ton as we've been informed to dispose of that contaminated material . The Recycling Center considers (inaudible ) material nonrecyclable and charges an increase fee. So they're saying they met with the representative . As a city weighs options, we are increasing the education to decrease the contaminated material . So we'll see some recycling education coming out soon, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 would imagine . And solicit of bids occurred in 2020. And they are reaching that cost of $120 per ton that's being currently charged. They stated that paper and cardboard recycling is not affected by the changes. But it just seems that they are continuing somewhat of a discussion on that issue. That's all for right now. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. So I don't think I have a lot tonight but I do have one thing that I'll mention after I'm done with a few of these responses . So first off, I received response on a property that I asked about at the last couple weeks for 231-233 Harrison Avenue. So I was -- I did receive a report from code enforcement on some of the things that have taken place with that property in the past. And so, I mean, it was condemned . There was a condemnation release request and that was in 2022. And then some other code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 enforcement -- I don't know if these were quality of life tickets or what they were issued for. But this was in 2023, so last year and then a building permit that was stopped in 2023 in March of last year. So I'm not sure why there's been nothing occurring at this point. But they are going to be having an inspector to revisit the property . So it's properties like this that do get lost in the mix and left behind. And then we don't know what's happening with them. So, you know, if anyone has others like that to bring to us, then we're always happy to see what's going on with them and try to get them back on priority list so that they can get fixed or properly dealt with. And then I was a little unclear on what I received . Mr. Voldenberg , I don't know if you could provide clarity about the curb cuts that I had asked about. I know that they said they were going to assign it to Scott and that there were some concerns that were listed. But I didn't see those. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , Dr. Rothchild . They assigned that to DPW Director 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 to review. So it was escalated . I'll get a status for you. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Hopefully we'll be within a response of that shortly because I know we've been asked about it for quite some time now. So I want to make sure that we finally do get some answers on when those curb cuts could be addressed . And I also wanted to request -- I don't think we received any updates recently on the study that was taking place on the non-profits in the city and their status and, you know, if we're able to get taxes from those organizations . Could we get an update on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that from the Business Administrator tomorrow . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, excellent . Thank you. And one last thing I wanted to address and it's something that's been brought up in chambers before and I take particular offense to it and that's the comments about those who are not from here because I'm not from here. And I did come here for school and stayed here and I've been ever since. I am 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 very proud of Scranton and to live in Scranton and I consider myself a Scranton ian even if I was not born here. And I am committed to the city. I'm raising my family here. And I care just as much about every Scranton ian as you all do here tonight who might be from here. And I'm always willing to put in the work to finding out more about our history because I feel like that does help me to make informed decision s, just like with Engine 10 on East Mountain . I'm all for keeping that up there on the mountain . I'm in agreement with my colleagues on that. So, you know, if there's something even if I haven't experienced it because I wasn't born and raised here and came here at a college age, I'm still always open to learning and finding out more and, you know, allowing that to help with my decision making. So, you know, I just wanted to mention that it's, you know, I think it's really offensive that you're saying that people who aren't from here can't lead in the city or can't work for the city or can't run city departments and still do a good job because I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 certainly feel like we can and like I'm doing just that. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : A few comment s. I'll start with Engine 10. So, you know, we got legislation to do a study a year ago. And collectively we voted it down up here because the wording and the language in the legislation that came down leaned towards taking it off the mountain and putting it at Chick's or whatever . It doesn't matter wherever . So, of course, I'm in agreement with my colleagues . I'm in agreement with the public that has come here and informed us -- I took a ride up that mountain . It's not my first time taking a ride up there to see Engine 10. And I drive a Subaru. It pretty much gets me anywhere . But on the way up I'm thinking how the hell or how with all the bends in the road -- I couldn't imagine driving a truck full of water up that mountain to put out a fire and safely get there with, you know, the required response time. There's a firehouse up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 there. All right? And there is surgence -- not only did I talk to some people up there, I talked to -- and also through out the city. But I talked to some residents . And there's surgence happening right now as we speak, there's petitions being signed to keep it on the mountain and the more the merrier . The more people that come -- and thank you, Mr. Lucas, you know, for your constant support up there and providing us with maybe some of the background knowledge that we don't have. I mean, we have some. But, I mean, and I'm not always a guy to quick vote for studies or consultants . I'm not. But for this case, I mean, this place was built in the 60s. All right, so I get that we need a study, you know, to make sure we're in compliance . I also think that your national organization maybe help us out with that. They're the experts too. They could weigh in on it. I mean, and the study equates to money. So I agree with that. But the language and this is known by the administration that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 know we want to keep it on the mountain . But the language we got in the legislation sent down is a little vague again. We're going to introduce it. But we, you know, and we're going to amend it. So that will require some work from our Solicitor , get the wording right. We got to get it right so it stays on the mountain . I mean, the wording and it says now, you know, we'll take a look at it and see what's best for the community . Well, it should be specific what community are we speaking of. It should be East Mountain specific , the language in this. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't like the way it reads now. We're going to introduce it because we'll keep it moving. But we have to tighten up the language . You know, it has to be East Mountain specific or resident , East Mountain resident specific or both so it stays there. That's all I have on that. And I applaud the people on the mountain that are coming out in full force now. I've heard it and I'm very proud of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 them because they live there and they pay taxes. They want the same protections as everybody else. I live in West Side. We have Engine 7. I'm blessed to have that a couple blocks from my house as taxpayers have the same. So that's enough on Engine 10. We'll keep our eye on it. You'll see next week so we'll have some better language there. And secondly , Mr. Voldenberg , we talked about this earlier . You know the property 3103 McCarthy Avenue with the blight issue, can you please get us an update? I know there was multiple issues there. I don't know what has been remedied or not but if you could please do a followup for us. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And then I got another inquiry . It's on Cabrini Avenue. So this is a little strange . So I guess, you know, one side of the street you can't park. There is no parking signs and they're there. And they're there from the block of 125 to 127. But there is no signs on the blocks below. So if there's no signs on that same 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 side of the street below, cars are parking there and causing issues at the corner of Jackson and Cabrini . And this is on the 100 block -- no, I'm sorry. So on the 100 block, half the block has signs and the other half doesn't. So I don't know if there were signs there originally or not. So could you please have the, you know, the proper departments take a look at it and see what's up with that and get us an answer for that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I just have a couple. Last week the request for the stop sign on Capouse Avenue and New York Street, Mr. Voldenberg sent that to administration , the city engineer and also to the Scranton Police Department . The concern on Harrison Avenue bridge about all the cracks, we found out from the state, the bridge people, that there are no issues with that. They are aware of them. They have been -- we spoke to them I guess 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 earlier this year during the summer. They came and looked at them and said they were normal stress cracks. They will be treating it and filling all the cracks. And they said but even after they fill the cracks, you're going to be able to see the lines of the cracks. But they will be filled. And we had a request for information on the pods that are dropped off at your house for packaging and moving and stuff. So we were working on that but it seemed to have gotten tabled a number of times. So we are back to working on that again and hopefully in the near future we will complete that one. That is all I have, Mr. McAndrew . MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Smurl, could I say one more thing? MR. SMURL: Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. MR. SCHUSTER : So there was one further inquiry that I made two weeks ago and Mr. McAndrew also brought it up last week. It was about the MOUs or the MOAs with the fire department and the DPW. So we asked if they had been signed and completed as it applies to residency . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 the answer that was received this week was that we are still in discussion with DPW and fire bargaining units and a response is forthcoming . So the residency MOUs or MOAs as the administration had called them that needed to be passed in August are still not settled . That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
