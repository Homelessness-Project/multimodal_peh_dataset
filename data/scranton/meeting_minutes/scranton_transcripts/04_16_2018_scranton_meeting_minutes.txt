MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions of comments ? MR. PERRY: Just two things real 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 quickly to hit on, the first thing was brought up about Crowley Park and the timeline . Mrs. Reed, if we can send a correspondence over to Mayor Courtright and also if you would copy Mr. Fallon at Parks and Rec we can get a response on that because I know we did talk about that last year, so I think we should be getting moving and if not what's the timeline. And the only other thing I wanted to bring up today was Item 5-B. I'm going to go ahead and introduce that today, but there is just a lot to look at. Any time new fees come down the pike it's -- we need to look at it very closely . The last thing we want to do in the city is put more fees on our citizens , on our ratepayers, on our taxpayers , so the question that immediately comes to mind without actually getting to the Licensing Department is how well are the fees that we are already put in place are working . Are we doing things to really increase quality of life or are we doing things to be punitive . I don't think that any fee that the city has should be punitive 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 in any way. These fees should be put there in place just to make our quality of life a little better. Are there warnings going out before fees are imposed ? So there is just a lot of things on there. How did these fees come about? How are the figures ? Are they based on something from another municipality or do they just come up at a meeting , you know, I'm not sure so there is a lot of questions there. I'm going to introduce this ordinance but, you know, there is a lot of work to be done I'm sure in the next week on the justification of these and are they going to be right for the city because I can't sit up here and put another fee on us without total justification . I just can't do it. You know, I believe you brought up the $30 for the dog license . You know, it's just when don't we turn around and get fees in the City of Scranton . So before we go ahead and enact new fees or increase new fees I think we need to do our due diligence and make sure these are actually the right thing for the entire city. So with that, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 I'll hold everything else for items on the agenda. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I would just like to -- I agree with Councilman Perry when it comes to the fees. The point of the fees shouldn 't be to raise money for the city, it should be, you know, to be compliant with current codes. I think that should be the focus. And to follow-up on, you know, the topic of garbage bills that I brought up last week and was also brought up here tonight , the discount period deadline currently is May 1, which is two weeks tomorrow , so I would like to make a motion that council send correspondence to the administration requesting that the deadline to be eligible for the 10 percent discount be extended until May 31. MR. PERRY: I'll second that motion. MR. ROGAN: Motion is made and a second, on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I'd also like to just briefly comment on the topic brought up last week by Councilman Gaughan regarding the Composite Pension Board actions on the allocations and proceeds from the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority . I would like to strongly urge the Pension Board to reconsider their recent decision to allocate proceeds based on the approved 45-45-10 model. I'm making the request for following reasons : First, the Sewer Authority was a public asset owned by each and every taxpayer of the city. Therefore , I believe it is imperative that the proceeds be reinvested in a way that beneficial to all taxpayers , and since pension liability is guaranteed by city taxpayers it is my opinion that the best possible outcome for all taxpayers would be to reinvest the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 proceeds in a way this equalizes the funding ratio for each pension fund. Now, I'm not naive enough to believe that we will be able to equalize the funding ratios with just this one transaction , but I think it's to point out that a funding ratio utilization must be a long-term goal to stabilize the funds, which also lead me to my next reason which is the annual MMO, or minimum municipal obligations . From the city's perspective , if the goal of investing sale proceeds into the pension funds is to decrease the city's annual MMO, then the pension board should at the very least use a starting point of the funding ratio that the funds actuary uses to calculate the MMOs every year and that comes out to a 52.3 percent share for fire, 39.5 percent for police, and 8.2 for non-uniform . Now, this decision is ultimately in the hands of the Composite Pension Board so I urge each and every member to ask themselves what is fair for all the taxpayers not just what is fair for each union. Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Mr. Evans, any motions or comment s? MR. EVANS: A few comments . On the Arcadis study I talked to Bernie McGurl and he briefed me on where we are at so I'll be getting some more information shortly . On the zoning board hearing , I was quite upset about the decision that was made. I feel that the code was misinterpreted that night and I let my opinion be known to the city planner and hopefully something will come out of that. On the pension issue as discussed by Councilman Donahue , the recent decision by the Composite Pension Board to split the approximately $22 million of the sewer proceeds in the following manner, 45 percent to the firemen's fund, 45 police to the police fund and 10 percent to the non-uniform fund was in my opinion a well-intentioned mistake . I believe the firemen's fund is still woefully underfunded , almost 20 percent below the other funds. It is my understanding , and certainly that of others, that any large 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 infusion into the pension fund could have been treated as an opportunity to rebalance the funds to bring them closer together to make the aggregate more balanced and financially stronger . The city pensions are only as strong as their weakest link. This decision does not go far enough to strength that weak link. Sometime in the future if we were to experience a severe downtown in the economy and/or the stock market, that weak link could fail and the results for the pension fund and the city would be catastrophic . My hope is that there is still time for some type of conversation and compromise that will strength all of the pension plans. So I'm respectfully asking the members of the Composite Pension Board to take a second look at this. I remain confident that reasonable people can come up with reasonable solutions even to the most difficult issues. That's all I have for now. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, just a few, thank you. I just want to read part of a letter here, we brought this up in the last few years when Councilman Wechsler was here because this is an issue that effects East Mountain . Lackawanna County is cooperating with the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the Bureau of Forestry in conducting a gypsy moth suppression project in certain forested section s of the City of Scranton this spring. The insecticide will be applied by aircraft flying approximately 50 feet among the treetops sometime in May. So this letter has the city of officials notified , city residents to avoid the possibility of eye irritation , obviously , don't look up as the spray droplets are descending . Vehicles which are exposed to the spray deposit s should be washed as soon as possible . If the deposit is dried soaking a towel with a car wash product and water will rehydrate it and it can be removed by wiping with a towel or a cloth. If there are any issues you can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 contact the local Bureau of Forestry Office, Lackawanna Forest District at 570-945-7133 for further information . Also, it's been brought up a few times about the street cleaning schedule , the street cleaning program , the schedule for this year is posted on the city's website . It's my upstanding according to the DPW director that the way that they did it this year was whoever was last on the list last year is now first on the list this year, so I thought that was a fair way to do it. North Scranton will be first, April 30 to May 4 and May 7 to May 11. So I will be announcing that every week and, again, it is on the city's website . I would make the recommendation again to the administration I think there is a better way that we can do this and a more efficient way. I looked at what some of the other cities do, particularly Allentown . They actually have a street cleaning hotline with daily updates. Their own webpage dedicated to street sweeping and designated days and time when there will be no parking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 on the street so that it can be actually cleaned . The one issue, and I brought this up before, is that people would move their cars if they knew exactly when the street sweeper was coming through their neighborhood , especially I know now in front of my own house with all of the cinder and everything , you know, it would be nice to know exactly when the street sweeper is coming and I think there are ways that we can coordinate that, it would take a lot of planning . So, again, I would recommend that the administration take that into consideration . We did not receive an update on the Lace Works project . I know neighbors in the area are curious as to what stage the developers are at so we'll update everyone when we get to that point. There is a -- I received a complaint about a large pothole on the bottom of Capouse Street and Drinker Court, so we will send that to the DPW. At last week's meeting I did bring up the Composite Pension Board vote to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 evenly split 90 percent of the $22.9 million in sewer sale proceeds between the fire and police funds with the remaining 10 percent going to the non-uniform fund and I share my colleague 's concerns with the way that that went down. The board voted five to two with one abstention to approve the allocation and I have reach out to the mayor's office to find out on what grounds did the mayor abstain from voting. I find it, quite frankly , unbelievable that a vote of that importance with that magnitude to spend $22.9 million and put it into the pension funds and you have the administration abstaining from the vote and then not giving a reason for the abstention . So I would like to know where the administration is on this issue, were they against it, were they for it? Why did they abstain ? And as I mentioned last week, I really have to question the sense of the way that this vote went down, and I'll use the analogy that I used last week, if you have two patients who come into the hospital , one is having a heart attack and the other one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 broke his thumb, do you give the same care to both patients ? No. You take care of the patient who is having a heart attack. So you have the fire fund, which is severely financially distressed , and you have the police fund which is doing better, and we are going to evenly put $22.9 million and the fire fund is still going to be severely financially distressed . I don't see the common in that. I think, as my colleagues mentioned , it should be revisited . Mr. Rogan had a vote on that board and he did vote "yes" and I do disagree with that. I think that the board should take another look. I would like to know if the Composite Pension Board took into consideration the new analysis that was paid for by the city and not the Pension Board and why was the analysis paid for by the city and why didn't the Pension Board pay for that. That's one question that I have. I don't think, as it was mentioned in the paper, this was about fairness. Fairness keeps being brought up, that they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 should have been allocated , everybody gets the same amount. Fairness to who? The police union? The fire union? This is about taxpayer and ratepayer money. This is proceeds from the Scranton Sewer authority that ratepayers paid for. This isn't anybody 's money but theirs, so it's not about fairness to either union, it's about fairness to the taxpayers in my opinion and if the fire fund remains severely distress and continues to erode then everybody is going to be negatively effected but you will eventually have to raise taxes. I would like to get an opinion from the Pennsylvania Economy League on where they stand on this issue. Did they think that this vote was the right vote to be taken? Were they consulted on whether this was the right move for the pension funds? Henry Amoroso , the mayor's financial advisor , what does he think? And most importantly , what does the mayor think? This is going to have a large effect on where we move forward financially over the next few years. So, again, I think we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 need to take another look. I would recommend that we have a public caucus with all of those involved in this and get their take on it because I'm, quite frankly , confused by the whole thing. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Two quick items, one, Crowley Park was brought up tonight , and we also have a request that we sent earlier in the week regarding the status on the Novembrino Park upgrades . Actually three items. Next week, as was mentioned , council will bring from the table two pieces of legislation that have been discussed quite a bit, one being the vote on the traffic control signals for the Sheetz project , so that will have an up or down vote at next week's meeting . And, secondly , the engineering services for the Serrenti Center will also be put back from the table next week regarding an up or down vote. Regarding the pension board vote, you know, this was -- the 45-45-10 split was well publicized prior to the meeting and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 there wasn't any objections from any of my colleagues or anyone as far as the city's financial advisors until after the vote was taken, so it wasn't a secret that the Pension Board's plan was to split the funds 45-45-10. I believe it was in the Scranton Times two to three weeks prior to th meetings , and at that point in time nobody had voiced any objections regarding that split. I do agree, you know, that there may be differences of opinion on how to best spend those funds, but during the course of the last couple of years in contract negotiations between the police and fire union that took place concessions were on par between both unions. Each union gave a similar amount of an increase in the pension and each union give the similar amount of their backpay back to the pension as a union concession as well. So if the thought was to put more into one fund than another , at that point in time that should have been addressed during these union concessions as well. I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 certainly open to hear from others on that issue, but again, there was no comment on this and it was a well publicized issue prior to the vote on that 45-45-10 split, but it was in the Scranton Times. That is all. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO ENTER INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT WITH WEST SCRANTON LITTLE LEAGUE, INC. FOR USE OF CITY OWNED PROPERTY FOR A THREE (3) YEAR PERIOD COMMENCING APRIL 15, 2018 AND ENDING APRIL 14, 2021. MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? I'll only mention because it was brought up, this has been a longstanding practice with the little leagues in the city that are technically owned by the city. They are leased out to nonprofit organizations such 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 as the West Scranton Little League who run them. They do remain public parks. The leagues certainly have the right to use them, others can use them as well, but West Scranton Little League is an excellent organization and I know for a fact they do a great job for the kids in West Side. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 64, 2014, AN ORDINANCE (AS AMENDED ) ENTITLED “AN ORDINANCE ADOPTING THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND VIOLATIONS TICKET PROCESS IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON ” BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE A NEW DEFINITION IN SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS , NEW VIOLATIONS IN SECTION 3. QUALITY OF LIFE VIOLATIONS AND NEW FINES AND PENALTIES IN SECTION 9. FINES AND PENALTIES . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I think it would be beneficial if we scheduled a caucus with Mr. Hinton because I do think there is a lot of questions about this legislation . One of the initial questions that I have is how the administration arrived at the fines that are in the backup here, so I hope that we can schedule that within the next three weeks. Thank you. MR. EVANS: On the question , I think as most people know any time I see an increase or enactment of any fees I get a little worked up about it. I think that what we really need to do is finally resolve the fee and fine schedule that is throughout all departments in the city, I know have talked about this before. So I'll be asking the administration to authorize an RFP to contract with an independent third party to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 finally review all fees with the goal of reducing the fine and/or eliminating unnecessary fees. Too much time has already been spent on trying to make these changes internally . It's a very frustrating process , so I think it's time for a professional to take a good hard look at these through an independent prism. So hopefully that amendment will be forthcoming, and if it is we may be looking at tabling this down the road or for the time being move it ahead to get the information from Mr. Hinton, as suggested by Councilman Gaughan , and see where it goes. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ?

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPLY FOR AND EXECUTE A GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT AND, IF SUCCESSFUL , A GRANT AGREEMENT , AND ACCEPT THE FUNDS RELATED THERETO FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA COMMISSION ON CRIME AND DELINQUENCY /JUSTICE ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM (PCCD JAG) IN THE AMOUNT OF $150,000.00. MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Sorry. You know, I just want to say since I have been on council for the last four years, I just continue to be impressed by Chief Graziano and the Scranton Police Department and some of the really creative things that they are doing with technology and now this, I support this legislation and this program . The police department is going to be utilizing technology to target prevention efforts and improve officer 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 performance . This is a state of the art use of force virtual training program . All Scranton Police Departments sworn officers will undergo virtual simulation use of force training that focuses on a de-escalation of dangerous situations and the utilization of force in a manner that complies with best practices , and just reading the backup here it says, "Better trained officers who are prepared for dangerous encounters that may require use of force specifically within individual 's suffering from mental and behavioral health issues while simultaneously building trust with the community ." One of the interesting things as I was reading through this legislation is, it says, "Another issue facing law enforce ment is that they are first responders during incidents involving individuals with mental or behavior health problems . In 2017, 180 individuals suffering from behavioral and mental health issues died in a law enforcement confrontation . It is crucial to equip law enforcement to properly recognize 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 and handle individuals with mental-behavioral health issues. Using virtual simulation training on a regular basis is a proven method in helping officers prepare for these encounters which all too often require some element of force." So I think that this program is going to be such a great tool for the police department because , you know, the world that we live in, as everybody knows, is so complex and police officers are engaged in situations that can be at times confusing and when to use force and when to not use force and we've seen really across the county the last few years some of these situations escalate and I think that the police department is taking a really proactive approach by using this technology to train our officers . So, again, I want commend Chief Graziano and commend the police department for taking this initiative and using this technology the way they are. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else?
