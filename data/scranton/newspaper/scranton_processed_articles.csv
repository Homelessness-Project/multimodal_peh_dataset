Meanwhile, homelessness became an even bigger issue28 in 2021. In the campaign for the Sept. 14 recall election, the major Republican candidates hammered Gov. Gavin Newsoms policies as ineffective29. The unsheltered population has increased by 24 from 2018 30to about 161,000 people in 2020. Experts believe that number has risen during the pandemic, though the state converted motels to create about 6,000 housing units31. A study by UCLA researchers found that nearly 1,500 people, the vast majority likely homeless, died32 on the streets of Los Angeles County between March 2020 and July 2021, many from drug overdoses. The increase is especially discouraging after the state has spent 13 billion on homelessness since 2018. A scathing state audit from February points to a main culprit a lack of coordination and accountability33 across the web of state agencies and local counties, cities and service providers. Still, Newsom and legislators allotted another 12 billion to address homelessness34 over the next three years, including 2.75 billion to buy and convert hotels35, office and commercial buildings into housing and 2.2 billion for behavioral health treatment.

Results revealed that patients that received dental care had substantially elevated improvements including 1 an increase in rates of SUD treatment completion 2 an increase in drug abstinence 3 an increase in employment and 4 a reduction in homelessness.
