Repurposing old buildings into housing is one [STREET] to tackle blight, while having less of an environmental impact compared to new construction. The big picture The number of old buildings being converted into apartments is on the rise across the country. Converted units have nearly quadrupled since [ORGANIZATION], from 5,271 to 20,122 by [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] converted a total of 1,863 units in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] combined, the most of any [PERSON] city over that [PERSON] period, according to a report from [ORGANIZATION]. Between the lines The main hurdle for developers is the cost, [ORGANIZATION], a ORG1 professor who oversees the real estate program, tells ORG2. Its often cheaper to demolish and create new construction rather than converting, [PERSON] says.The overwhelming majority of redevelopment in the city is still new construction, according to [ORGANIZATION] economist [PERSON]. Yes, but [ORGANIZATION] provides some incentives to off-set that. A bill that took effect [PERSON] is starting to phase out the citys [ORGANIZATION] property tax abatement2 for new residential construction. But, theres a caveat for converted properties, which get to keep the entire [ORGANIZATION] tax incentive. As of [LOCATION], [LOCATION] projects that are historically designated dont have to provide parking, and some get zoning perks. What theyre saying [ORGANIZATION], president of [ORGANIZATION], has been repurposing buildings for DATE8. PERSON4 tells ORG2 theres a lot of work to be done in the city. If your passion is blight removal, we have a lot of factories and a lot of unused office buildings. We have a lot of blight in the neighborhoods. PERSON5, executive director of the Preservation Alliance of Greater [ORGANIZATION], said adaptive reuse projects can help attract tourists to GPE2. He hopes it can also make headway in addressing the citys housing crisis. Itd be great to see more adaptive reuse for affordable housing since theres quite a bit for market-rate housing, [PERSON] says. Itd be nice to see them play a bigger role.

scranton,2022-01-10T00:00:00Z,ClimateWire,WILK,"homelessness, affordable housing",PERSON0 to prioritize climate spending in [ORGANIZATION] budget,"She didnt reveal the other four focus areas. Bold climate action has been a priority of the governor for [ORGANIZATION], and he has no plans of lightening that up, the spokesperson said. [ORGANIZATION] projects the budget for [ORGANIZATION] will include a 31.2 billion surplus, the result of the states highest earners flourishing. It follows a similar situation [PERSON], when the state had a surprise 75.7 billion budget surplus for [ORGANIZATION]. As part of that, [ORGANIZATION] and the Democratic-controlled [ORGANIZATION] pledged 15 billion dollars over [PERSON] to fight climate change and its impacts. It includes efforts to boost zero-emission vehicles and charging stations, and to combat extreme heat, drought and catastrophic wildfires. ORG2 Leader [PERSON] said that push will continue. As we focus on putting [ORGANIZATION]s wealth to work [PERSON], we have again identified climate as a key budget priority as we begin to negotiate the [ORGANIZATION] state budget, [ORGANIZATION] said in a statement. Fires, drought, extreme heat, and the impacts of sea level rise are not going away, and it is the lower-income and middle class [ORGANIZATION]ns who will bear the brunt of climate change. She added that several senators, including policy and budget chairs are focused on these and other policy issues in the climate space. [ORGANIZATION], chair of [ORGANIZATION], released a slate of priorities. Those include 10 billion in infrastructure for transportation projects, including transit. But hes also focused on goals that include school funding to deal with learning gaps and mental health issues with the pandemic, and money to reduce homelessness and provide affordable housing. [ORGANIZATION] said one of his priorities is ensuring the 15 billion pledged for climate [PERSON] gets rolled out as promised. Although it was part of [PERSON]s package, the money needs to get allocated DATE8. [ORGANIZATION] cites wildfires, drought as issues Republicans argue more money is needed for programs to battle the states frequent droughts. [ORGANIZATION] has been delinquent in building sufficient water storage, a fact that was clearly seen recently as agricultural water supplies dried up, state Sen. PERSON5, the Republican leader, said in a letter to Democratic leadership. The state should use surplus funds to build FAC0 and provide water conveyance in critical areas of the state. This will provide water storage for 1.5 million homes per year and promote much-needed water access for [ORGANIZATION]s food producers. [ORGANIZATION] said he wants to ensure that drought response and water resilience funding goes to the most vulnerable communities while promoting the long-term drought resilience. [ORGANIZATION] members also urged more work to prevent wildfires. Scientists say climate change has made those more fierce. Avoiding major wildfires would do more to improve greenhouse gas emissions than many of the majority partys mandates and restrictions, [ORGANIZATION] said. Fire prevention efforts can include improving vegetation management and making at-risk homes more resistant to flames. Environmental groups are lobbying for their priorities. [ORGANIZATION] Club[ORGANIZATION] wants more money for water recycling, conservation and efficiency technology. More money to get underserved communities in electric vehicles more money in building decarbonization and getting natural gas and other fossil fuels out of [ORGANIZATION] homes, said [PERSON], the groups director. The group also wants funding toward [ORGANIZATION]s pledge to preserve 30 percent of state land by [ORGANIZATION] PERSON7, policy director at [ORGANIZATION], said the budget should include money to fund programs to convert heavy-duty vehicle and off-[STREET] engines to clean models, fulfilling regulations coming from the [ORGANIZATION] Air Resources Board. As well, the state needs to keep funding programs to get people with lower incomes into electric vehicles, such as the Clean Cars 4 All, effort. The [ORGANIZATION] Energy Commissions Clean [ORGANIZATION] Program to fund zero-emission infrastructure also needs support, he said. [ORGANIZATION] is the largest source of the emissions that cause climate change and air pollution, so were largely focused on cleaning up that sector, he said in an email.."
scranton,2022-02-10T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,"homeless, homelessness, affordable housing, unhoused",[ORGANIZATION] gives sneak peek of new [PERSON] plan,"The governors remarks  which came during a press conference at which he signed into law a restoration of extra paid time off for [PERSON]-related sick leave3 and assorted tax credits for [PERSON]  offered the clearest glimpse yet into the states forthcoming plan for treating [PERSON] like any other [ORGANIZATION]. Although details remain murky, here are three key takeaways I gleaned from [ORGANIZATION] comments New plans would likely allow for some level of local control. As we move forward with yet another phase of this pandemic, we do so mindful that each county local health officer, based on local conditions, will make determinations for themselves, [ORGANIZATION] said. Case in point While eight of nine LOC0 [ORGANIZATION] will follow the state and let their indoor mask mandates [ORGANIZATION] after [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] is joining [PERSON] in holding off until specific conditions are met. Educators are concerned about the consequences of low youth vaccination rates if school mask mandates are lifted. Thats why we continue to work with those local health officers and local superintendents school boards and leaders within the system and try to address their concerns as it relates to community spread, as it relates to what they anticipate experiencing once those mask requirements are removed, [ORGANIZATION] said. Although conditions will continue to change, the state is prepared to take a definitive step in its approach to the virus. We also are in a date with destiny, we recognize that we want to turn the page on the status quo, [ORGANIZATION] said. But even if the state were to lift its school mask mandate, the even more explosive issue of school vaccine mandates10 remains  and some district deadlines are rapidly approaching. PERSON1, a veteran education journalist and past executive director of [ORGANIZATION], recently [ORGANIZATION] that it would be an educational and political impossibility to keep the states sizable number of unvaccinated kids out of school and in remote learning. But ORG2, anticipating that thousands of students wont meet its vaccination deadline, voted [LOCATION] to move ahead with [LOCATION] to establish six new online schools that could enroll up to 15,000 students. And if districts refuse to enforce the states inoculation mandate, they could lose significant amounts of state funding and liability insurance coverage13.

A message from our ORG8 stories you should know 1. PERSON5 antes up on crime The windows of the ORG9 store in FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION] were boarded up as of [LOCATION]0. Videos on social media showed masked people running with goods from several high-end retailers in the storied shopping area. Photo by PERSON6  ORG10 Heading into the homestretch of [LOCATION]1, Gov. [PERSON] announced that he will include more than 350 million to combat retail theft and other crime in his budget proposal in [LOCATION]2. Some of the money will make permanent a [ORGANIZATION] Highway Patrol smash and grab enforcement unit12, which claims 300 arrests and 19 million in recovered merchandise already, and expand it from [LOCATION], [PERSON]0 and [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]1. As [ORGANIZATION] PERSON8 explains13, the takeaway from PERSON5s [ORGANIZATION] press event seemed to be While crime isnt really high historically and the smash-and-grabs at high-end boutiques are being [ORGANIZATION], the public is very concerned and the state has a huge budget surplus, so why not spend some more on anti-crime efforts? [ORGANIZATION] mean nothing in terms of your feelings. Its the most recent and clearest example of [ORGANIZATION] Democrats talking tougher on crime15 heading into the [LOCATION]3 election. Republicans in the ORG13 are not impressed. [LOCATION] ORG14 leader [PERSON] It shouldnt have taken increasing homicide rates, widespread news reports of smash-and-grabs, and pleas from [ORGANIZATION]ns for Democrats to come to this realization. 2. Will stricter [ORGANIZATION] rules backfire? The office of [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]1 on [LOCATION]4. ORG16 [PERSON]0 The rampant fraud at [ORGANIZATION] unemployment department has been a big story during the pandemic. For good reason At least 20 billion in bogus claims16, some filed from behind bars. But what if tightening the rules to stop fraud hurts [ORGANIZATION]ns who can least afford it? [PERSON]1 of the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Divide team explores that conundrum, in the context of a new policy17 that could require tens of thousands of [ORGANIZATION]ns to return their unemployment benefits because they may not have been working or looking for work. The state ORG18 began issuing notifications of the proof-of-work requirement [LOCATION]5 to about 900,000 people, one third of the recipients of a federal program that ran from [LOCATION]6 and ended in [LOCATION]7. It was aimed at those who dont usually qualify for unemployment benefits because they are freelancers or small-business owners. Under the policy, they must prove that they were working, or planning to work, prior to filing their unemployment claim. If they cant, they would be ineligible and asked to give the benefits back. That would be more than 32,000 if a recipient received full benefits for [LOCATION]8 of the program. In addition, if a claimant offered false information, the state could impose a 30 penalty. But some experts say that could force people to pay back money they dont have, and are suggesting giving recipients a pass. [PERSON]2, executive director of [ORGANIZATION] should be saying, Look, if you got unemployment insurance benefits during that time, youre fine. If the concern is fraudulent claims, then do the work to fix the administration of the system. 3. A clarification on nursing homes An item in the [LOCATION]9 newsletter18 about a [ORGANIZATION] story on nursing homes19 should have made clear that the industry association opposes tying funding only to staffing, but supports tying funding to other patient quality standards. Also, the item should have said that [PERSON] Health chairperson [PERSON]3 is the one appalled by the number of [ORGANIZATION] deaths in skilled nursing facilities. New ORG22 housing law [PERSON]4 gives a quick [PERSON] of a major change in single-family zoning in a New law in [TIME] video produced by [PERSON]5. DATE20 housing stories you should know [PERSON]6 right, and [PERSON]7 left with his dog near the encampment where they both were staying before it got disbanded by ORG23 in [PERSON]2. [DATE], DATE20. Photo by [PERSON]8 for [ORGANIZATION] A lot happened DATE22 on the housing and homelessness beat. Heres a look back at the biggest developments, as reported by [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]4. Did the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic and the first population decline since DATE23 stop [ORGANIZATION] housing prices from rising in DATE20? Nope. The statewide median home price reached a record 800,[ZIP], more than double the national average. While potential homeowners had it rough, so did some renters. The ORG13 twice extended a statewide eviction moratorium22 that banned landlords from kicking out tenants over missed rent payments. But an investigation by [ORGANIZATION] uncovered that at least 10,000 households23 fell through that safety net and were locked out between [LOCATION]6 and March DATE20. The state received more than 5 billion in federal aid for rent relief, but the rollout for tenants and landlords was slowed for much of DATE26 by problems with language, reliable internet and public awareness25. There was some action at the state [PERSON] to increase the housing supply. The most significant move a new law that does away with the single-family zoning26 that dominates the majority of the states developable land. [PERSON]9, policy director for ORG25 at ORG26 It signals that lawmakers are willing to take on the traditional sacred cows of housing and single-family zoning. From a political standpoint, thats a pretty significant shift in the housing landscape. Meanwhile, homelessness became an even bigger issue[ORGANIZATION]4 in DATE20. In the campaign for the DATE27 recall election, the major Republican candidates hammered Gov. [PERSON]s policies as [LOCATION]. The unsheltered population has increased by 24 from DATE[ORGANIZATION]4 30to about 161,000 people in DATE29. Experts believe that number has risen during the pandemic, though the state converted motels to create about 6,000 housing units31. A study by ORG27 researchers found that nearly 1,500 people, the vast majority likely homeless, [PERSON] on the streets of [PERSON]3 between [LOCATION]6 and [DATE] DATE20, many from drug overdoses. The increase is especially discouraging after the state has spent 13 billion on homelessness since DATE[ORGANIZATION]4. A scathing state audit from [ORGANIZATION]1 points to a main culprit a lack of coordination and accountability33 across the web of state agencies and local counties, cities and service providers. Still, PERSON5 and legislators allotted another 12 billion to address homelessness34 over [ORGANIZATION]2, including 2.75 billion to buy and [PERSON], office and commercial buildings into housing and 2.2 billion for behavioral health treatment. Some money is also going to clear homeless encampments36. Learn even more in the newly updated [ORGANIZATION] explainer on [LOCATION].

scranton,2021-11-01T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,homeless,State renews $1.7B contract with troubled [ORGANIZATION] lab,"The automatic renewal, which [ORGANIZATION] spokesperson [ORGANIZATION] confirmed to me [ORGANIZATION] [TIME], comes as the state faces scrutiny for its failure to release a report investigating significant deficiencies at the lab. Gov. [PERSON] administration said3 the full report would be made available in [LOCATION]. DATE2, it is nowhere to be found. I urge you to halt auto-renewal of the contract, ORG1 Republican Leader [PERSON] wrote in a DATE3 letter4 to the states top health officials, arguing that it would be irresponsible to let any contract auto-renew when serious allegations remain unanswered and the report out of public reach. PERSON3 told me in a statement The state plans to continue to have ORG2 operational to ensure that we have adequate testing capabilities going into [DATE]. We will continue to evaluate our need for the laboratory as we do with all aspects of our response.The state can elect to terminate the agreement without case sic with DATE5 notice. To date, the state has paid [ORGANIZATION] 716 million to operate the laboratory, with majority of funds recovered through the federal funds and health insurance claims. The state opened FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] after giving diagnostics company [ORGANIZATION] a no-bid [ORGANIZATION] to operate it. Problems began popping up almost immediately. Whistleblowers told [PERSON] that lab techs were sleeping while processing [PERSON] samples, test swabs were found in bathrooms and staff were inadequately trained. Although the state initially disputed the extent of the problems, it later admitted8 that it had become aware of significant deficiencies in DATE8. Indeed, state health inspectors gave the lab an immediate jeopardy [PERSON]  which represents10 the most severe and egregious threat to the health and safety of recipients. Meanwhile, the lab has consistently struggled to meet its mandate11 of processing 150,000 tests a day and turning results around quickly. According to the most recent state [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] processed less than 195,000 tests for [PERSON] and returned only 40 of test results within [LOCATION]5  one of the lowest rates in the state. The lab also has a history of high rates of invalid, lost or cancelled test results. According to [PERSON], 1 out of every 42 tests processed at ORG7 as of [LOCATION]0 did not return a clear positive or negative result. [ORGANIZATION] did not respond [LOCATION]1 to questions from ORG8 about the contract renewal. PERSON3 said that more than 1,600 schools are using the lab for [PERSON]-19 testing  but that doesnt include the states largest district, [ORGANIZATION]. Former Superintendent PERSON4 told [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] that ORG10 signed a testing contract with private company [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]2  [LOCATION]3 before the state made public its contract with [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] said that each test costs the district about 12 compared to the 53 charged by [ORGANIZATION]15 during [LOCATION]4 and that the deal stipulated the district wouldnt pay anything if accuracy thresholds and [TIME] results werent met. [ORGANIZATION] data shows16 [ORGANIZATION] returns 99 of test results within [LOCATION]5. [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] Unified reviewed the [ORGANIZATION] price and terms and elected to stay with [ORGANIZATION] because the price and terms were materially better for the school district. Interestingly, the states contract with [ORGANIZATION]17 also allows it to cancel the deal if [PERSON]-19 testing has become commercially available at lower cost and [ORGANIZATION] is unable to achieve comparable cost reduction.

Indeed, [PERSON] had privately questioned his purpose in attending the conference and didnt have plans to make any major announcements, [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]4 reports25. The last-minute pivot is eerily similar to an episode from [LOCATION]0 2020, in which [PERSON] backed out of a prime-time speaking spot at [TIME] before his scheduled speech.

As of DATE29, the city had logged 320 homicides  putting it on track to potentially top 400 [PERSON] for the first time since DATE30. The surge in murders has increased homicide detectives workload29, resulting in less cases being solved. Meanwhile, [PERSON] [PERSON]5 is warning30 that the countys vaccine mandate will result in a mass exodus of law enforcement officers, increasing dangers to public safety.A ORG17 grocery store in GPE7 is limiting its hours31 due to what one supervisor described as out of control shoplifting. The move comes DATE31 after ORG18 announced plans to close five GPE7 stores32 because of organized retail crime.

[ORGANIZATION] pulls bill, [PERSON] delays his Democratic state Sen. Richard [ORGANIZATION] of [PERSON] speaks at a news conference in GPE2 on [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] by PERSON3, [ORGANIZATION] the space of [TIME] on [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]s possible [PERSON] vaccine mandates for students were significantly scaled back and then postponed for [PERSON]  underscoring the political risk Gov. Gavin [PERSON] and state lawmakers might have taken on by ordering thousands of unvaccinated kids into distance learning in DATE5. First, Democratic state Sen. Richard [ORGANIZATION] of [PERSON] tabled his controversial bill2 that would have required all children [ORGANIZATION] to be vaccinated against [PERSON] to attend school or child care in person. Support for the proposal had been wavering for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] PERSON5 reports3. That move defaulted the state back to [PERSON]s vaccine [ORGANIZATION], which is much looser than [ORGANIZATION]s  among other things, it allows for personal belief exemptions and wouldnt require kids to get vaccinated until DATE8 after federal regulators fully approve the shot for their age group. But then the [ORGANIZATION] Department of Public Health  part of [PERSON]s administration  announced [PERSON] to delay the governors mandate until [PERSON], at the earliest to ensure sufficient time for successful implementation of new vaccine requirements. Postponing the mandate could prompt some public health officials and parents to accuse [PERSON] of putting students and teachers health at risk and endangering vulnerable communities. But keeping the mandate in [STREET]  when just 33.9 of children [LOCATION]0 and 66.4 of kids [LOCATION]1 are fully vaccinated, according to state [PERSON]  could be tantamount to blocking tens of thousands of students from attending campus and forcing them back into online learning. Black and Latino kids, who have lower vaccination rates than white and Asian children, would be disproportionately [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] Until childrens access to [PERSON] vaccination is greatly improved, I believe that a statewide policy to require [PERSON] vaccination in schools is not the immediate priority, although it is an appropriate safety policy for many school districts in communities with good vaccine access. [ORGANIZATION]s decision to hold his bill is also the most concrete indication yet that Democratic lawmakers aggressive slate of vaccine proposals8 is facing an increasingly uphill [PERSON] in a state that [LOCATION]2 announced it no longer recommends quarantine10 for asymptomatic people exposed to [PERSON]. Also tabled11 Democratic [PERSON] contentious bill that would have required employers to mandate [PERSON] vaccinations for their workers and independent contractors.

scranton,2021-09-01T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,homelessness,Recall puts elections chief in political pickle,"Theres also Secretary of [ORGANIZATION]  who has been thrust into the awkward position of administering an election that could oust from office the very man who appointed her to the role1. [PERSON], a [ORGANIZATION] Democrat and former state [ORGANIZATION], faces a politically precarious task defending [PERSON]s recall process  even if she thinks it has some serious [PERSON]  and encouraging residents to [PERSON] without giving the impression of supporting [ORGANIZATION]. The trickiness of this balancing act was evident [ORGANIZATION], when [PERSON] reported5 that [PERSON] election officials are spending 16 million on a voter education campaign intended to boost turnout  a move that will likely benefit [ORGANIZATION], given the states nearly 2 to 1 ratio of registered Democrats to Republicans. The campaign is officially nonpartisan, but the [PERSON] Republican Party has accused the agency running the campaign  ORG3  of being pro-Democrat, citing its [LOCATION] work with [LOCATION] and an [ORGANIZATION] celebrating President PERSON3 and Vice President [PERSON] win. During the [DATE] [LOCATION] election, then-Secretary of [ORGANIZATION] PERSON5 office came under fire for awarding a 35 million voter education contract to a firm tied to ORG6 presidential campaign7. PERSON6, [ORGANIZATION] press secretary, told me [ORGANIZATION] that the two leaders of the voter education campaign are registered as Republican and no party preference. We have that perspective intentionally, he said, adding, The fact is, we have a state full of voters of both parties. Elections are supposed to reflect the will of the people, and you dont have that if people dont turn out. Nevertheless, critics questioned the appropriateness of [PERSON] and Attorney General [PERSON]  another [ORGANIZATION] appointee, whos publicly endorsed the governor  holding a press [ORGANIZATION] to remind [PERSON]ns of their voting rights ahead of the recall. During the event, [PERSON] emphasized that its a sacred part of this democracy for every [PERSON]n to vote in this election and every election. But she also appeared to stop mid-sentence when explaining the recall ballot, potentially to choose more neutral words to describe the second question. [PERSON] Its a ballot with two questions on it, really, do you or do you not want to recall the governor, simple yes or no. And the second question is if for some reason you want  he is recalled, who would you want as his replacement? However, Republicans praised [PERSON] for adhering to the letter of the law and not granting [ORGANIZATION]s appeal to list himself as a Democrat on the [PERSON] despite his lawyers missing the filing deadline to do so. Shes also been the defendant in other high-profile lawsuits one from recall frontrunner PERSON9, who challenged tax return requirements he won and got on the ballot and one from three [PERSON] voters11 who argued the recall was unconstitutional they lost. During [ORGANIZATION], though, the line between state official and politician can get blurry. At an GPE2 vaccine clinic on [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] noted that 80 of eligible [PERSON]ns have received at least one shot12 and encouraged hesitant residents to get vaccinated. But then he pivoted to campaign mode. Simple request, he said. Vote no and go to the mailbox. Simple no vote. Dont even turn the page and consider the other 46 questions that are being asked.

[PERSON]member PERSON1, a [PERSON] Democrat The most important takeaway from this announcement is that there is now a proposal in [ORGANIZATION] to suspend the gas tax with bipartisan support. But, as ORG2 Republican Leader [PERSON] was quick to point out, his caucus had proposed the very same idea [ORGANIZATION]. While bipartisan support is welcome, it only matters if the Democrats can help us get the proposal across the finish line, he said. And its unclear if they can. PERSON3, a spokesperson for Gov.

Furthermore, the Democratic leaders of the state [PERSON] and ORG2 have made it abundantly clear that suspending gas taxes isnt their preferred form of relief.

About half of [ORGANIZATION]s DATE93,000 online K-12 students are currently enrolled in [LOCATION]4, and about a fifth are enrolled in [LOCATION]4 franchises, where district teachers assist students in working through [LOCATION]4 curricula.

[PERSON] passes bills on addiction, child hearing loss[LOCATION]2 via [ORGANIZATION]4 of [LOCATION]5  While Democratic and Republican lawmakers have had a contentious debate on issues like abortion and immigration DATE41, the two sides came together [PERSON] to pass 20 bills quickly, almost all unanimously. The legislation included approving new state legislative districts, authorizing schools to stock and use medicines to counteract an opioid overdose and requiring insurance companies to provide hearing aid coverage for children. Democrats and Republicans praised a bill that would expand the use of overdose-reversing drugs, including allowing schools to stock naloxone, which could be administered by staff trained to recognize an opioid overdose.

[ORGANIZATION]6 [PERSON] DATE93, a measure filed as it has in DATE43 by Rep. [ORGANIZATION]9, would remove laws that require a concealed-weapons permit in [ORGANIZATION]. Since the end product has yet to be marked up in committee, it is as yet unclear the extent to which the bill would allow the public display of firearms, with no restrictions, and [ORGANIZATION]7 has some reservations about unfettered open carry.

The bottom line is the American dream is slipping away for more and more people DATE45, Sen. [PERSON] said.

That includes how voters in the district cast ballots in [DATE] presidential elections and the [ORGANIZATION] gubernatorial race. In this case, the new district came out as R1, closer, actually, and its trended more purple over time.

When Dr. PERSON65 was asked clear questions about his departments role in addressing the pandemic, he offered non-answers, obfuscations and demonstrations of [PERSON].

In [ORGANIZATION] meeting, state Rep.

[ORGANIZATION]2, a concerned parent who reached out to me after reading my column about the wrong-headed Dont [PERSON] bill moving through the ORG2, says her DATE49 daughter has been talking about the topic at home. The bill would silence gay children, their teachers and education advocates by banning the discussion of sexuality and gender identification in [ORGANIZATION]s public schools. Indeed, youth should have a prominent voice in the discussion of the bill and so should the science- and data-oriented experts who know the [STREET] of sexuality in education. Like parents, these experts also are concerned about the damage lawmakers who introduced the bill already are doing to set back the lives of gay and trans children in [ORGANIZATION]. Why put more limits on public petition campaigns?24 via [ORGANIZATION]3 of the [LOCATION] Democrat  Theres a proposal ready for a vote in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6 [DATE] that would limit the subject matter of petition campaigns to procedural matters, the structure of state government and the Constitution itself.

The ORG2s desire to acknowledge [ORGANIZATION]s robust strawberry industry is admirable. But choosing strawberry shortcake as the method for doing so is not.

The filling of the board allows the [PERSON]24 administration to move forward in supporting people-to-people projects on the ground after the funds were allocated through the Nita M.

Speaking at [ORGANIZATION]00 [ORGANIZATION] Chapters conference near GPE[LOCATION]17, [PERSON]25 delivered his strongest response yet to [PERSON]26s ongoing efforts to relitigate the [DATE]8 Presidential Election, calling it un-American to suggest one person could have decided the outcome. [PERSON]25 warned against conservatives who insist that the Vice President can alter an election and said it could be a problematic position for Republicans in the next presidential contest. out On the issue of overturning the election, [ORGANIZATION] throws [PERSON] [PERSON]26 under the bus. Newly obtained records show [PERSON]26 and [PERSON]96 spoke at length on [TIME] of [LOCATION][ORGANIZATION]3 via [PERSON]97, [PERSON]98 and [PERSON]99 of [ORGANIZATION]41  The [ORGANIZATION]6 select committee investigating the FAC0 insurrection is now in possession of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6 records that provide new details about a phone call [PERSON]26 made to Rep. PERSON200 on [LOCATION], [DATE], as the investigation drills down on the former Presidents communications [LOCATION]03 and questions have long swirled around calls between him and lawmakers. Two sources reviewed call records that [PERSON]26 spoke on the phone at the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6 residence with PERSON200 for [TIME] on the [TIME] of [LOCATION]. In censure of PERSON26 and PERSON27, [ORGANIZATION]8 calls events of [LOCATION] legitimate political discourse[ORGANIZATION]4 via PERSON201 of [ORGANIZATION]41  In a resolution formally censuring [ORGANIZATION]7 Reps. PERSON202 and PERSON203, [ORGANIZATION]43 on [DATE]3 described the events surrounding the [LOCATION], [DATE] insurrection, which have been at the center of a [ORGANIZATION]6 probe, as legitimate political discourse. A copy of the resolution obtained by [ORGANIZATION]41 claimed that the two lawmakers were participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse from their perches on the [ORGANIZATION]6 select committee. A [LOCATION] suspect died. Now the [ORGANIZATION]44 has to prep for conspiracies.[ORGANIZATION]5 via PERSON204 of [ORGANIZATION]45  A man featured on the [ORGANIZATION]44s website, wanted for assaulting police at the FAC0 during the [LOCATION] attack, died [LOCATION]04. In [LOCATION]05 since the [LOCATION] investigation began, the [ORGANIZATION]44 has posted images of more than 500 individuals on its GPE7 FAC0 Violence webpage. More than [LOCATION]170 of those included on the page still havent been arrested, including dozens who have been successfully identified by online sleuths. Removing his image from the website now could spark additional conspiracy theories that could only be resolved through public identification, which would set off a fresh round of pain for a family still recovering from its loss. His removal from the list without being charged has prompted rampant conspiracy theories that he was acting as a plant to stoke the crowd.  PERSON205  This was [PERSON]4 when [PERSON]26 revealed all[ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION] via PERSON206 of The [ORGANIZATION] Post  [PERSON]26 has told some big lies over [LOCATION]05s. One of the biggest, it now is clear, came on [LOCATION]07, [PERSON] after his supporters assaulted the GPE7 FAC0. On [LOCATION], as law enforcement officers fought valiantly against an armed mob of rioters attacking the FAC0, [PERSON]26 remained in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6, silent in the face of repeated efforts by advisers, family members and allies who pleaded with him to try to call a halt to the violence. [LOCATION]08, in a videotaped address, he said, finally, that he was outraged by the heinous attack on the FAC0. He didnt mean it, as he made clear [ORGANIZATION]1end. [PERSON] [PERSON]26 has told many lies, but one stands out. The extreme ideas floating around [PERSON]26 on how to overturn the election[ORGANIZATION]7 via PERSON207 of The [ORGANIZATION] Post  As [PERSON]26 tried to hang on to power after his election loss, he surrounded himself with advisers, lawyers, and seemingly random people who were willing to give him ideas. We keep learning just how drastic some of those ideas were. The President appeared to take some more seriously than others, but it seems clear that [PERSON]26 andor his top aides at least entertained the thought of seizing voting machines. A memo was circulated among [PERSON]26 allies suggesting that the [ORGANIZATION]48 could be used to try to prove a baseless claim about fraud. And thats just whats been revealed in reporting and from the congressional [LOCATION] investigation. [PERSON]26 and allies try to redefine racism by casting [ORGANIZATION] men as victims[ORGANIZATION]8 via PERSON208 of The [ORGANIZATION] Post  Holding [STREET] at a political rally in [PERSON]6 [ORGANIZATION]1, [PERSON]26 implied that he, a wealthy [ORGANIZATION] man who was elected to an office almost exclusively held by [ORGANIZATION] men, was also a victim of racism. [PERSON]26s claim referenced what he said were three radical vicious, racist prosecutors, one in [PERSON]7, one in [PERSON]8, one in [ORGANIZATION], all of them Black, who are investigating his role in the [LOCATION] insurrection and examining his business organizations finances. But his comments made him the latest in a line of conservatives claiming, loudly and frequently, that [ORGANIZATION] men are also victims of racism. How [PERSON]26s political style smothered the last substance left in the [ORGANIZATION]7[ORGANIZATION]DATE8 via PERSON209 of The [ORGANIZATION] Post  PERSON210 [LOCATION] is not the first attempt to take a long view of how the party of PERSON211 became the party of [PERSON]26. [LOCATION] is persuasive in suggesting that the long-term transformation of [ORGANIZATION]50 is one in which a style of politics has overpowered and then suffocated any remnant of its substance. The [PERSON]26 era in American politics can feel uniquely disruptive, but PERSON212 highlights earlier episodes that, put together, leave [PERSON]26 looking like an inevitable outcome rather than an unlikely outlier. PERSON213 in exile70 via PERSON214 of the [ORGANIZATION]ian  PERSON216 [PERSON]26s world has certainly gotten smaller. Shes out of politics at the moment, out of her former executive job at the [PERSON]26 Organization, out of the womenswear brand that bore her name, out of high society in [PERSON]8, and cast out of [ORGANIZATION], too. PERSON216 never did find her footing in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6 or [PERSON] society [LOCATION] was the final rupture. Now the PERSON217 have sought refuge in [PERSON]9, a town that previously managed to stay off most peoples radar. Which was just fine with plenty of residents. PERSON213 arent only the towns most well-known inhabitants  theyre also among its most invisible. Still, [PERSON]9 hasnt completely sheltered them from the bitter political storm they helped create. The PERSON217 are laying low. Very low. PERSON218 is still at war71 via PERSON219 of [ORGANIZATION]29  [LOCATION]10 [LOCATION]11, PERSON220 spoke with [ORGANIZATION]52. Claiming that the [DATE]8 election involved probably the greatest fraud that our country has ever experienced in our history, [PERSON]2 was not going to allow [DATE]8 to happen, and so now what we have is this theft with mail-in ballots. He insisted that a legitimate counting of the ballots would have resulted in a [PERSON]26 landslide. PERSON220 was beginning to envision a military role. Its not unprecedented, PERSON220 insisted to [ORGANIZATION]53 host PERSON221 on Dec. [LOCATION]2. I mean, these people out there talking about martial law, like its something that weve never done, he said, adding, Im not calling for that. PERSON220 was, in fact, calling for sending the military to the contested states. LOCAL NOTES  Two men in [PERSON]2 stole 1[PERSON] ventilators, worth 3 million, the authorities say.72 via PERSON222 of [ORGANIZATION]29  Two men in [PERSON]2 have each been sentenced to [LOCATION]13 in prison for stealing medical ventilators bound for a [ORGANIZATION] care facility in GPE40 as part of a GPE7 aid program. The crime occurred in DATE62 [DATE]8, according to a news release issued after the sentencing of the second of the two men. The men, PERSON223 and PERSON224, stole a tractor-trailer from a parking lot in South [ORGANIZATION] that was loaded with 1[PERSON] ventilators, worth about 3 million, that were bound for [PERSON]2 International [INSTITUTION] for shipping to GPE40 by [ORGANIZATION]. low can you go?

PERSON227, [LOCATION]17, said he wants a judge to know that he put his oath as a doctor above government orders in [ORGANIZATION] when he treated wounded civilian protesters who sought to dismantle President [TIME] regime. A hearing for [ORGANIZATION] asylum case was set for [LOCATION]18 in GPE[LOCATION]17, then abruptly canceled because of [ORGANIZATION] concerns, his lawyer PERSON230 said. Online [STREET] records show there are no future hearings scheduled for [ORGANIZATION] case, which has been consolidated with his wife and daughters requests for asylum. Rising antisemitism in South [ORGANIZATION] and beyond fuels concern and determination in Jewish community74 via [PERSON]84 of the South [ORGANIZATION] Sun-Sentinel  Drivers on FAC15 in GPE[LOCATION]17 last [PERSON]9 were confronted with a Nazi flag displayed on an overpass, along with a banner proclaiming [ORGANIZATION]55 the Jews and listing the same website as the [LOCATION]20 flyers. The incidents are part of what Jewish community leaders and others said is a disturbing trend an increase in the number of antisemitic incidents, some violent, others aimed at instilling fear. Both locally and nationally, we have seen steady increases in antisemitism and all forms of bigotry over the past few [LOCATION]15, said PERSON231, interim regional director of [ORGANIZATION]56 in [ORGANIZATION]. [LOCATION]8 of the city GPE42 mayor talks about boom times, crime, expensive housing and water problem75 via Wayne [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION]06  Basking in GPE42 Beachs economic boom times, [LOCATION] PERSON233 declared that the state of our city [PERSON]1 is strong, our economy is sound, and our state of mind is sturdy. The mayor touted the new office buildings sprouting up in the city, talked up partnerships with the University of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] Agricultural and [ORGANIZATION], noted what he described as a drop in crime, and announced that hes increasing his goal for the construction of affordable housing units. While PERSON2[LOCATION]37 said hes proud of the citys accomplishments over [LOCATION]22, he is pushing his administration to do more. Housing, he said, is still too expensive for many. The city has been chipping away at homelessness but wants to do more on that front. [PERSON] PERSON235 face any penalty after investigation into his lies?

Many outcomes could take [STREET] in [LOCATION]23 The Governor soon could act to suspend PERSON237 from office. He could wait for a state ethics panel to recommend whether any discipline or penalty is warranted  and delegate that task to the ethics panel. Or he could decide to do nothing at all. PERSON237s case can be a complicated matter to decide, said attorney PERSON239. The decision to remove an elected official from office can be subjective, PERSON240 said. Legal standards, quite frankly, can be a little blurry sometimes. deep PERSON235 faces several possibilities many are not good.

Clearly frustrated by what high school [DATE] breakers bring to the county, residents called for the county to institute a [DATE] break curfew and be more visible and proactive in addressing lawbreaking, particularly underage drinking. [LOCATION]25, [LOCATION] Commissioner PERSON237 [PERSON], whose district includes most of the countys 2[ORGANIZATION] miles of public and private beaches, asked for consideration of a [ORGANIZATION] curfew  TOP OPINION  PERSON244 Before any ban, [ORGANIZATION] should first look at GPE47 successful ranked choice voting78 via [ORGANIZATION] Politics  Ranked choice voting [ORGANIZATION] has a long history in GPE48 for state and county [ORGANIZATION]60 elections going back to [LOCATION]26. Starting in 201DATE8, GPE48 cities have had the option to use [ORGANIZATION] for their nonpartisan elections. [ORGANIZATION] is a faster, cheaper, and better [STREET] to run our local elections in GPE48. Traditionally, GPE47 local elections include a Preliminary Election in DATE62 to narrow down the field, and then a General Election in [LOCATION]27 between the top candidates. With [ORGANIZATION], cities can replace two elections with one  shortening the campaign [DATE] and reducing the cost to taxpayers. Instead of going to the polls twice which data shows greatly reduces turnout, voters only have to go once!  OPINIONS  [ORGANIZATION]8 should take a lesson from [PERSON]257DATE8 via [ORGANIZATION]61 editorial board  There is no conceivable political benefit to [ORGANIZATION]50 or its members, other than [PERSON]26, in looking to defend or minimize [LOCATION] rather than simply move on. The American people are never itching to hear a defense of rioters. But the voters have also shown little interest in the Democrats obsession over the event. Republicans who did nothing to encourage the mob, and there are many such Republicans, need not wear a hair shirt over [LOCATION], but when they choose to talk about it, they should tell the unsparing truth. We commend the example of [PERSON]25. [PERSON]25 gives bombshell speech that [PERSON]26 was wrong. But now comes the hard part80 via [ORGANIZATION]4 editorial board  [PERSON]25 finally, finally, finally said what needed to be said. President [PERSON]26 is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election. Well, hallelujah. Its [LOCATION]28, and its not under oath. But he said it, and to a [ORGANIZATION] gathering of [ORGANIZATION]00, a conservative legal group. If [PERSON]25 truly wants to remedy any of the damage to this country, he should now encourage other Republicans to drop the masks of falsity so many have willingly worn for [LOCATION]29, too fearful of [PERSON]26 to stop mouthing his [LOCATION]. For [PERSON]25, it might turn out that his speech was the easy part. But [PERSON]1, in this one moment, hearing a top Republican say the plain and simple truth gives us a flicker of relief, a momentary cessation of pain, like a national headache that suddenly stops hurting. Will [ORGANIZATION]s election police be afraid of ghosts? Lawmakers, dump this idea81 via [ORGANIZATION]4 editorial board  The PERSON246 ghost candidate scandal has called into question the results of one [PERSON]2 [PERSON] race and maybe two others, one in [PERSON]2 and another in GPE49, all won by Republicans. Its turning into one of the worst abuses of our election system in [LOCATION]30. That has us thinking DATE61be we were too hasty when we said [ORGANIZATION]3 proposed election security office was a waste of time and tax money. Surely this kind of potential misconduct would be its reason for existing. Nope. Sen. [PERSON], sponsor of the [PERSON] bill that would create an election security office, said [ORGANIZATION]0 that the special investigative unit that [ORGANIZATION]3 has called for would only deal with election fraud  not candidacy fraud, according to [ORGANIZATION]8. If Democrats dont ask questions, nobody [DATE] via PERSON248 of the South [ORGANIZATION] Sun-Sentinel  The [PERSON] Ethics and [ORGANIZATION] discussed a controversial and hasty 45-page rewrite of a bill that includes a scaled-back version of [ORGANIZATION]3 new elections police force [PERSON] [PERSON] [DATE]. Thats [LOCATION]-speak for stopping debate and calling for a vote so the minority Democrats cant run out the clock by asking questions. None of the five Republicans asked probing questions. Senators need to keep asking questions about those elections cops, and the potential for partisan witch hunts, and every other proposed change to voting laws. But they learned [DATE]3 they will have one less chance to do so. Fewer hearings mean fewer questions, and [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] was rerouted by the [PERSON] Presidents office to one fewer committee. Legislation poses a real risk to our states children[LOCATION]9 via Dr. [PERSON] for the [LOCATION] Democrat  There is an existential threat to children in legislation currently being considered by the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6. If passed, [ORGANIZATION]6 [PERSON] [LOCATION]0DATE85 would codify a presumption of [DATE] timesharing between divorced parents. While this may sound fair and reasonable on its face, it is not it poses a real risk to our states children and, I believe, it must be stopped. As a regularly appointed social investigator in family law cases, I work almost exclusively with families going through a divorce and are in conflict over the timesharing of their children. So, it is with this extensive firsthand experience that I speak out against this presumption of the [DATE] timesharing provision in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]0DATE85.

It passed in March [DATE]8, and [ORGANIZATION]3 happily signed it. Fast-forward [LOCATION]33, and there was [PERSON] accusing [ORGANIZATION]65 of using critical race theory CRT. What changed? How did these two go from passing and signing legislation assailing racism and antisemitism to become cheerleaders for a movement aimed at sanitizing LOC8 shameful racial history? One bills answer to corruption More secrecy85 via [ORGANIZATION]8 editorial board  There is one bill thats more dangerous than any pro-secrecy legislation weve seen in a long time. If it passes, [LOCATION] 1547[ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]378 could tunnel new and secretive channels in [ORGANIZATION]s already corrupt campaign finance system by hiding the names of big-money donors. Well, if these bills pass, lawmakers will have done something They will have made the situation much, much worse, by wrapping a cloak of secrecy around the names and other identifying information of those big-money donors. Holier-than-thou book banners in [ORGANIZATION] ought to start with the Bible8[ORGANIZATION] via PERSON252 of [ORGANIZATION]06  We may have to ban the Bible from [ORGANIZATION]s public schools. Book banning is starting to take off in [ORGANIZATION], and as long as it is, we shouldnt leave the Bible out of the discussion. A national group called The County Citizens [ORGANIZATION]1ing Freedom has formed in [ORGANIZATION]5 to remove books from [INSTITUTION] libraries deemed harmful to children under the age of [LOCATION]3. OK, so if we need to scrub the [INSTITUTION] shelves from books that promote the socialist mentality andor contain narrative accounts of sexual excitement or sexual conduct, its time to round up all the [LOCATION] and lock them away from the children.

Oil and gas interests and utilities have also spent more than 1.1 million to help Republican PERSON2, a [LOCATION] who sits on [ORGANIZATION], who is running5 for an open [ORGANIZATION] seat representing the GPE5 area against Democrat [ORGANIZATION] Democrat benefiting most from the oil industry is [ORGANIZATION], a former [ORGANIZATION] supervisor running [ORGANIZATION] Democrat PERSON5, who has been endorsed by the [ORGANIZATION] League of Conservation Voters. Oil and gas interests have spent 1.3 million to help [PERSON], who has aligned himself with the ORG7s moderate Democrats. Most of the spending  about 55  has gone toward attacking PERSON7.What they wantWhen Democratic Gov. [PERSON] signed an order recently banning the sale of gas-powered [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION]  and asked the [PERSON]1 to send him a bill outlawing the oil extraction method known as fracking  the industrys priorities for [ORGANIZATION] snapped into focus.Bans are not the [STREET] to solve problems, said [ORGANIZATION], president of [PERSON]2. We would not support a ban on any form of crude oil production in [ORGANIZATION]because it means more imports of foreign oil.In addition to fighting legislation8 that would outlaw hydraulic fracturing, the oil industry will almost certainly9 try to block efforts to expand the use of electric cars. [PERSON]3 is calling attention to electric car batteries, many of the minerals for which are mined in [LOCATION] and [PERSON] where, she said, they still use child labor. Environmentalists counter that oil production in foreign countries also can involve human rights abuses.Oil lobbyists convinced lawmakers to kill [PERSON] that would have required a buffer zone between oil wells and locations where children gather, such as schools and playgrounds. [PERSON]4 lobbyist [PERSON] said environmentalists are preparing for another round.There is going to be a bill again on trying to get setbacks from oil wells, she said. And oil will be fighting that. Prison guardsPhoto by [PERSON]1 for [PERSON]5 Who they areThe [ORGANIZATION] Correctional Peace Officers Association was once a gale force to be reckoned with in state politics. At the height of [ORGANIZATION]s three-strikes-and-youre-out crime crackdown, Democrats and Republicans alike feared getting on the wrong side of the guards.The Great Recession, [STREET] orders to reduce the state prison populations, and a series of successful ballot measures to relax sentences all pushed the guards into a more defensive posture over [ORGANIZATION]. The union tamped down its spending and its fiery rhetoric and refocused on bread-and butter-issues  maintaining pay and improving working conditions.Now its [PERSON] and the guards of old is trying to make a comeback. Under the new leadership of [PERSON]2, the union is once again gunning to become the 800-pound gorilla11 of [ORGANIZATION] elections. Where theyre spendingThe guards have spent nearly 4 million DATE2 with the bulk of that money pouring into two races.In [LOCATION], Republican [PERSON]3 has served as the [ORGANIZATION]s most outspoken fiscal hawk. The union has spent nearly 1.4 million in the race  attacking [PERSON]4 as a [PERSON]5 loyalist and [ORGANIZATION] or boosting his opponent, Democrat [PERSON]6, a law professor at [PERSON]7.The group has also spent more than 960,000 attacking12 Democratic ORG7member [PERSON]7  including one ad that placed a bullseye13 over the [ORGANIZATION] politicians face  and supporting his Democratic opponent, [PERSON]8, the former head of [PERSON]8.What they want [PERSON] tabs on the latest [ORGANIZATION] policy and politics news [ORGANIZATION]! Youre on the list. Whoops! There was an error and we couldnt process your subscription. Please reload the page and try again. In [PERSON], [PERSON]9 announced plans14 to close a prison in [PERSON]0 within [ORGANIZATION]. Hes said hed like to close at least one more15 before [ORGANIZATION]. And starting DATE8, the state will begin phasing out16 its juvenile prison system entirely, shifting that responsibility down to the counties.[PERSON]9, director of [ORGANIZATION] and a critic of the unions political activities, said he isnt surprised the guards are spending big DATE2.Whatever keeps the prisons filled are things that they support, he said. With the current economic downturn and [PERSON] and all the pressures brought about from that, if the governor starts talking about closing prisons, that is kicking them into gear.The guards wrath has been bipartisan, aimed at both conservative budget hawks and liberal criminal justice reformers.PERSON20, the guard unions president, did not respond to an interview request. But given Sen. [PERSON]4s fiscal rectitude  he was one of four senators to vote against a 3 pay raise for the guards [PERSON]  its no surprise the guards would rather the [LOCATION] senator retire [ORGANIZATION]0.Maybe they want to make an example of me, [PERSON]4 said. PERSON22, the unions other top target, is no fiscal conservative. Hes a PERSON23-endorsed progressive. Hes also backed tougher oversight of law enforcement officers17, including prison guards, and less strict sentencing18. As chair of the ORG7 public safety committee, criminal justice bills generally do not become law without his blessing. Facing a surprisingly strong challenger in PERSON24, the prison guards have rushed in to unseat him. [ORGANIZATION] via ORG27 Who they areTogether, the [ORGANIZATION] Teachers Association, the [ORGANIZATION] Federation of Teachers and the [ORGANIZATION] Faculty Association represent more than 450,000 public K-12 teachers and university professors. Both in membership and financial pull, [PERSON] is the dominant force, a political behemoth with strong ties to the [ORGANIZATION] Democratic leaders.Where theyre spendingUnlike most interest groups that target heavy spending on a handful of legislative races, the teachers political operations spread cash around. Theyve spent more than 2 million cutting checks ranging from 10,000 to 40,000 to help dozens of incumbent Democrats running for re-election in noncompetitive races.Teachers have also spent more than 695,000 trying to influence which Democrat voters send to [PERSON]1 in a pair of expensive same-party contests. Teachers, like many labor unions, are backing PERSON25, a [PERSON]2 supervisor and former mayoral candidate, in the race against attorney and campaign finance regulator PERSON26 for a LOC2 seat in the state [ORGANIZATION]19. Through a joint committee with other organized labor groups, theyre helping incumbent PERSON22 over fellow Democrat20 PERSON24 in the [PERSON]3 area race.In similar joint ventures, the unions spent a combined 482,000 trying to flip two [LOCATION]-based [ORGANIZATION] seats from the ORG8 to Democrats. Theyre helping Democrats [PERSON]621, a [PERSON]7 law professor, and [ORGANIZATION], a former state senator who was recalled from his seat in [ORGANIZATION]1. Those two are trying to replace, respectively, Republican state Sens.[PERSON]4 and PERSON29.What they wantTeachers perennially lobby for more funding for public education, but the push is likely to be particularly intense [ORGANIZATION]2. The coronavirus pandemic has hammered government finances23 and upended the [DATE] routines of millions of [ORGANIZATION] students whose campuses have been shuddered since [ORGANIZATION]3.We cant open schools until its safe to do so, and right now its not safe, said PERSON30, a spokesperson for the [ORGANIZATION] Teachers Association. We dont have ventilation, we dont have testing and tracing.All that, of course, costs money.Education groups may also tussle [ORGANIZATION]2 over how to teach reading. For [ORGANIZATION]4, teachers have pushed a bill to eliminate a test requirement for new teachers24 to demonstrate they can teach phonics. The bill died amid objections from advocates who said removing the requirement would put kids at risk of landing in a classroom with a teacher who cant help them learn to read. But even advocates who opposed that bill acknowledge that too many teachers dont have sufficient skills to teach reading, which contributes to students poor performance for [ORGANIZATION]5 to come. They say theres not enough oversight of teacher training.We indeed have a structural problem that is sending novice teachers into classrooms ill-prepared to teach early reading to [ORGANIZATION] children, PERSON31, president of the ORG26 advocacy group, said by email. ORG26 also has a campaign committee, which has spent nearly 122,000 DATE2 to support PERSON24. ORG28Image via ORG27 Who they areThe friendly folks who help [ORGANIZATION]ns buy and sell their homes are also one of the most influential lobbying groups and campaign rainmakers in the state. Any policy debate that touches housing  how and where homes get built, how much landlords can charge for rent and how easy it is to buy and sell old homes25  interests the ORG28.Where theyre spendingAll over the [STREET]. The ORG28 not only make their financial presence felt through their own committees, but they frequently pool their campaign cash with other well-monied interests. All together, roughly 2.3 million in [LOCATION] cash has shown up in [ORGANIZATION] legislative races.Nearly 700,000 of that has been spent in two [PERSON] races.[LOCATION] cash is backing PERSON32 over fellow Democrat PERSON33, teaming up with other powerful interest groups like the building industry, organized labor and the dentist lobby. Up the [ORGANIZATION], the ORG28 have unleashed their own committee in support of [PERSON]4 Sen. [PERSON], who hopes to fend off a challenge from Democratic Socialist PERSON35.The ORG28 are also backing incumbents in competitive races across the state more than 300,000 in support of Republican Sen. PERSON29 over Democrat PERSON36 and more than 100,000 a piece supporting ORG7members PERSON37, a Republican, against Democratic challenger and [PERSON]5 City Councilmember Melissa [ORGANIZATION]7 PERSON22 moderate Republican PERSON39 of [PERSON]6, who is being challenged by [PERSON]7 Councilmember [ORGANIZATION]0 and Republican-turned-independent [ORGANIZATION]1 of [PERSON]8 in his race against Republican [PERSON]9 mayor [ORGANIZATION]2.What they wantThe [PERSON] legislative session was [ORGANIZATION]6 that wasnt for [ORGANIZATION] housing policy. The ORG28 want a mulligan.In his State of the State speech26 in [ORGANIZATION]7, [PERSON]9 vowed to put homelessness and housing at the top of our agenda and urged legislators to say yes to housing.Then the coronavirus intervened, curtailing the legislative session, gutting the states spending power and scaling back everyones legislative ambitions. Even relatively modest housing supply boosters, such as a [LOCATION]-backed bill that would have allowed property owners to build duplexes in neighborhoods zoned for single-family homes, failed to make it to the governors desk27.The targeted support of the two LOC3 candidates Sen. [ORGANIZATION]3 in [PERSON]4, one of the states preeminent voices for more housing production, and PERSON32 in [ORGANIZATION]0, a former housing developer and real estate investor  is an investment in more supply-related legislation.A loss by [ORGANIZATION]3 would send a real chilling effect on housing, said [ORGANIZATION]4, CEO of the [ORGANIZATION] Building Industry Association, a financial ally of the ORG28 in both races. Likewise, a PERSON32 win would add to the pro-production bloc in the [ORGANIZATION]. If you have to walk into a legislators office and explain how to build housing, thats very different than if they can explain it to you.But the ORG28 also want to maintain good relationships with incumbents and ensure a bulwark against new rent control measures28 and eviction moratoria29.That may explain the whiplash-inducing about-face the organization pulled in [ORGANIZATION]1 DATE2. During the primary, the ORG28 supported former Democratic ORG7member [ORGANIZATION]5, who is hoping to unseat incumbent Republican [ORGANIZATION]6. That spending helped [ORGANIZATION]7 secure his [STREET] on the general election ballot. Many irate Democrats30 speculated at the time that this was a play to propel [ORGANIZATION]7, whom they saw as the weaker Democratic candidate during the primary, into a face-off with [ORGANIZATION]8.Sure enough, now that its [ORGANIZATION]8 versus [ORGANIZATION]7 on the general election ballot, a group called the [ORGANIZATION] Alliance for Progress and Education has spent more than 77,000 against [ORGANIZATION]7. [LOCATION] groups have contributed at least 44 of that committees cash. The [ORGANIZATION] Association of ORG28 did not respond to a request for comment. Other big spendersIllustration via [ORGANIZATION] GroupsAltogether, hospitals, dialysis clinics, doctors, dentists and psychiatric technicians have spent nearly 3 million in independent expenditure hoping to influence [PERSON] competitive legislative races. But the health care industry contains multitudes and not all of these interest groups are on the same political page.Dentists make up one of the largest sources of health care industry cash. A committee sponsored by the [ORGANIZATION] Dental Association has spent half a million dollars to prop up some of the ORG7s most vulnerable center-right members Republican [ORGANIZATION]9 in [ORGANIZATION], Republican PERSON39 in [PERSON]6 and [ORGANIZATION]1 of [PERSON]831, who defected from ORG8 and is now an independent.But the biggest single beneficiary of health care industry independent spending has been PERSON24 over PERSON22 in the [PERSON]3 area ORG7 race. And his benefactors have been some strange allies.Since the primary, kidney dialysis company [ORGANIZATION]5  the largest funder of opposition to Proposition [DATE]  has forked over 249,000 to a pro-PERSON24 committee. That investment was pooled with a slightly larger contribution from [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION]. The committee, [ORGANIZATION]7 thus noted major funding from [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] in its title with no mention of the dialysis corporation.Likewise, the trade group representing the pharmaceutical industry spent another 49,500 on a pro-PERSON24 committee co-funded with the pro-charter organization ORG26. ORG26 kicked in 50,000 and its name was listed on the committee name.Other UnionsEven if you separate out the teachers, the nurses, the building trades, the prison guards and the cops, the organized labor groups that remain are still some of the most prolific election spenders.Think [ORGANIZATION]9, [PERSON]0, [PERSON]1, the [PERSON]2 and the firefighters. These are all influential groups with a lot of money to spend. [ORGANIZATION]9, all of that money has gone to support Democrats.PERSON32 in [ORGANIZATION]0 has been the biggest beneficiary. Most of that support has come from the labor-run [PERSON]3, one of the largest independent expenditure committees in the state, second only to the oil and gas industrys committee. Though PERSON32 and his opponent PERSON33 are both Democrats, PERSON32 cemented his ties to organized labor when he ran for mayor in DATE20 championing his opposition33 to the citys pension cost cutting plan.TechIn the heart of LOC2, [PERSON]4 and [PERSON]5 have opted to spend lavishly on their home turf.So far DATE2 a business-affiliated committee, [ORGANIZATION], has spent more than 2.5 million to boost PERSON33 over PERSON32. Three-fourths of that committees contributions DATE2 come from the two ride hailing companies. That works out to about 1.9 million in support of PERSON33  or nearly 90 of all the independent expenditures the tech sector has piped into [ORGANIZATION]s legislative races DATE2. No surprise PERSON33 supports Proposition [DATE], the ballot measure sponsored by [PERSON]4 and [PERSON]5 to exempt its drivers from [ORGANIZATION] labor law. PERSON32 opposes the measure. In addition to the high-stakes [PERSON]5 vs. PERSON50 presidential match, the [PERSON] ballot asks you whether to raise property taxes, expand rent control, ban cash bail, further protect consumer data privacy and resurrect affirmative action. It also will determine if the state [PERSON]1 remains in the control of a gigamajority of Democrats, and if the blue wave that swept away half of ORG8-held congressional seats has receded.

This rule updates the [ORGANIZATION] payment rate for [ORGANIZATION].3. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58IP The [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58IP is authorized by section 1881h of the [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] fosters improved patient outcomes by establishing incentives for dialysis facilities to meet or exceed performance standards established by the ORG1 [PERSON]. This rule finalizes our proposals to suppress the use of certain [PERSON] measure data for scoring and payment adjustment purposes in the [DATE] [PERSON] because we have determined that circumstances caused by [ORGANIZATION] for the coronavirus disease [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] pandemic have significantly affected the validity and reliability of the measures and resulting performance scores, as well as special scoring and payment policies for [DATE]. We are also finalizing our proposal to update the specifications for the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure beginning with the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON]. We are also finalizing our proposal to use [ORGANIZATION] data to calculate the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] performance standards. This final rule further describes policies that will apply for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. Finally, this final rule describes several requests for information that also appeared in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule. These requests for information solicited stakeholder feedback on several important topics, including strategies that we can use to address the gap in existing health inequities, the addition of [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures in future rulemaking, and the use of digital quality measurement.4. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Model This rule finalizes changes to [ORGANIZATION], a mandatory [PERSON] payment model tested under the authority of section [DATE] of the [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] is operated by [ORGANIZATION] and ORG13 Innovation Innovation Center, and tests the use of payment adjustments to encourage greater utilization of home dialysis and kidney transplants, in order to preserve or enhance the quality of care furnished to [PERSON] beneficiaries while reducing [PERSON] expenditures. [ORGANIZATION] includes [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities and certain clinicians caring for beneficiaries with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]--or [PERSON]93--located in [ORGANIZATION] as participants. [ORGANIZATION] was finalized as part of a final rule published in [ORGANIZATION] on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION], titled, [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] and Reduce Expenditures 85 FR [ZIP], referred to herein as [ORGANIZATION] final rule. [ORGANIZATION] is designed to test the effectiveness of adjusting certain [PERSON] payments to [ORGANIZATION] facilities and [PERSON]93--clinicians who furnish and bill [ORGANIZATION] for managing [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION]--who have been selected to participate in [ORGANIZATION] to encourage greater utilization of home dialysis and kidney transplantation, support beneficiary modality choice, reduce [PERSON] expenditures, and preserve or enhance the quality of care. In [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we established that [ORGANIZATION] adjusts payments for home dialysis and home dialysis-related claims with claim service dates from [DATE]5 through the PERSON8me Dialysis Payment Adjustment HDP[PERSON] We are assessing the rates of home dialysis and of kidney transplant waitlisting and living donor transplantation, among beneficiaries attributed to [ORGANIZATION] Participants during [DATE], and ending [DATE][DATE]. Based on those rates, we are applying [ORGANIZATION] PPA to claims for dialysis and dialysis-related services with claim service dates beginning [DATE], [DATE]1, and ending [DATE]9. We codified these provisions in a new subpart of the Code of [PERSON]11 Regulations [ORGANIZATION] 42 [ORGANIZATION] part 512, subpart [PERSON] This final rule includes modifications to [ORGANIZATION], including changes to the home dialysis rate and transplant rate, the PPA achievement benchmarking methodology, and the PPA improvement benchmarking and scoring methodology. We are also adding processes and requirements for [ORGANIZATION] Participants to receive certain data from [PERSON] and including certain additional waivers and flexibilities as part of [ORGANIZATION] test.B. Summary of the [ORGANIZATION] Provisions1. [ORGANIZATION] Update to the [ORGANIZATION] base rate for [ORGANIZATION] The final [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] base rate is 25[DATE].90 This amount reflects the application of the wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor 0.[ZIP] and a productivity-adjusted market basket increase of 1.9 percent as required by section 1881b14FiI of the [ORGANIZATION], equaling 25[DATE].90 253.13 x 0.[ZIP] x 1.019  25[DATE].90. [ORGANIZATION]0 update to the wage index We adjust wage indices on an [ORGANIZATION]1 basis using the most current hospital wage data and the latest core-based statistical area [PERSON]0 delineations to account for differing wage levels in areas in which [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities are located. For [ORGANIZATION], we are updating the wage index values based on the latest available data and continuing the [ORGANIZATION]2 transition to the ORG12 [PERSON]1 delineations as described in the [ORGANIZATION]3 [PERSON]1 Bulletin No. 18-04. Update to the outlier policy We are updating the outlier policy using the most current data, as well as updating the outlier services fixed-dollar loss [ORGANIZATION] amounts for adult and pediatric patients and [PERSON] allowable payment [ORGANIZATION] amounts for adult and pediatric patients for [ORGANIZATION] using [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] claims data. Based on the use of the latest available data, the final [ORGANIZATION] amount for pediatric beneficiaries will decrease from 44.[DATE]8 to 26.02, and the [ORGANIZATION] amount will decrease from 30.88 to 2[DATE].15, as compared to [ORGANIZATION]5 values. For adult beneficiaries, the final [ORGANIZATION] amount will decrease from 1[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54.49 to [DATE]5.39, and the [ORGANIZATION] amount will decrease from 50.92 to 42.[DATE]5 The 1.0 percent target for outlier payments was not achieved in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] payments represented approximately 0.6 percent of total payments rather than 1.0 percent. Update to the offset amount for the transitional add-on payment adjustment for new and innovative equipment and supplies [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] The[PERSON] 618[DATE]6final [ORGANIZATION] average per treatment offset amount for the transitional add-on payment adjustment for new and innovative equipment and supplies [ORGANIZATION] for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines is 9.50 This offset amount reflects the application of the productivity-adjusted market basket increase of 1.9 percent 9.32 x 1.019  9.50. [ORGANIZATION] applications received for [ORGANIZATION] In this final rule, we announce our determination on the one [ORGANIZATION] application under consideration for the [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] payment.2. Payment for [ORGANIZATION] Furnished to Individuals With [ORGANIZATION] We are updating the [ORGANIZATION] payment rate for [ORGANIZATION]. The final [ORGANIZATION] payment rate is 25[DATE].90, which is the same as the base rate finalized under the [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION].3. [PERSON] We are adopting a measure suppression policy for the duration of [PERSON]0 that enables us to suppress the use of one or more measures in [ORGANIZATION] for scoring and payment adjustment purposes if we determine that circumstances caused by [PERSON]0 have significantly affected the measures and resulting performance scores. We are also finalizing our proposal to suppress the Standardized PERSON8spitalization Ratio [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure, [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure, the ORG81 [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] clinical measure, and [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for [DATE] under the measure suppression policy. We are also finalizing our proposal to not score or reduce payment to any facility in [DATE]. We are finalizing our proposal to update the specifications for the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure beginning with the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON]. We are also finalizing our proposal for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] to use [ORGANIZATION] data to calculate the performance standards for [ORGANIZATION]6. This final rule also announces the performance standards and estimated payment reductions that will apply for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0. This final rule describes several policies continuing for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1, but does not include any new requirements beginning with the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 [PERSON]. This final rule includes public comments received in response to requests for information that appeared in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule. In those requests for information, we solicited stakeholder feedback on several important topics, including closing the gap in health equity, adding a [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measure for health care personnel [PERSON]56 to [ORGANIZATION] measure set in future rulemaking, adding a [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measure for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients to [ORGANIZATION] measure set in future rulemaking, and potential actions and priority areas that would enable us to continue moving toward a greater digital capture of data and use of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON][DATE][DATE]supreg standard in quality measurement.4. [ORGANIZATION] Model We are implementing the following changes to [ORGANIZATION] beginning for [ORGANIZATION]8 of the Model, which begins [PERSON]95anuary 1, [DATE]1. [PERSON] for PERSON45ving [ORGANIZATION] To better reflect the care relationship between beneficiaries who receive pre-emptive living donor transplants [ORGANIZATION] and the [PERSON]93 who provide their care, we are modifying the methodology for attributing Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON]93, such that a Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] will be attributed to [ORGANIZATION] who submitted the most claims for services furnished to the beneficiary during [DATE]0 prior to the transplant date. PERSON8me Dialysis Rate Calculation To incentivize additional alternative renal replacement modalities under [ORGANIZATION], we are adding nocturnal in-center dialysis to the calculation of the home dialysis rate for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities and [PERSON]93. Transplant Rate [PERSON] Exclusion To better align with common reasons transplant centers do not [STREET] patients on the transplant waitlist, we are excluding beneficiaries with a diagnosis of, and who are receiving treatment with chemotherapy or radiation for, vital solid organ cancers from the calculation of the transplant rate. [ORGANIZATION] Benchmarking Methodology When we originally finalized [ORGANIZATION], we stated our intent to increase achievement benchmarks above rates observed in [ORGANIZATION] for [DATE]1. As such, we will increase achievement benchmarks by 10 percent over rates observed in [ORGANIZATION] every two MYs, beginning in [DATE]4[DATE] [DATE]1. We also will stratify achievement benchmarks based on the proportion of attributed beneficiaries who are dually-eligible for [PERSON] and ORG13 or receive the [ORGANIZATION]ow Income Subsidy [ORGANIZATION]IS during the MY, in recognition that beneficiaries with lower socioeconomic status have lower rates of home dialysis and transplant than those with higher socioeconomic status. [ORGANIZATION] In conjunction with the stratification of the achievement benchmarks based on the proportion of beneficiaries who are dual-eligible or [ORGANIZATION]IS recipients, we will introduce [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] to the improvement scoring methodology used in calculating the PP[PERSON] [PERSON] expects that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] will encourage [ORGANIZATION] Participants to decrease disparities in renal replacement modality choice among beneficiaries with lower socioeconomic status by rewarding [ORGANIZATION] Participants that demonstrate significant improvement in the home dialysis rate or transplant rate among their attributed beneficiaries who are dual-eligible or [ORGANIZATION]IS recipients. We also will adjust the improvement scoring calculation to avoid the scenario where an [ORGANIZATION] Participant cannot receive an improvement score because its home dialysis rate or transplant rate was zero during [DATE]3. [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] To ensure that [ORGANIZATION] Participants have timely access to [ORGANIZATION] Model reports, we are establishing a process under which [PERSON] will share certain model data with [ORGANIZATION] Participants. [PERSON] Waivers We are including an additional programmatic waiver to provide [PERSON]93 who are [ORGANIZATION] Participants additional flexibility in furnishing the kidney disease patient education services described in [ORGANIZATION]. 410.48, namely a waiver of certain telehealth requirements as necessary solely for purposes of allowing [ORGANIZATION] Participants to furnish kidney disease patient education services via telehealth under [ORGANIZATION] to take effect at the end of [PERSON]0. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] We will permit [PERSON]93 who are [ORGANIZATION] Participants to reduce or waive the beneficiary coinsurance for kidney disease patient education services, subject to certain requirements. We have made the determination that the anti-kickback statute safe [INSTITUTION] for [PERSON]-sponsored model patient incentives 42 [ORGANIZATION] 1001.9[DATE]ii2, will be available to protect the reduction or elimination of coinsurance that is made in compliance with our policy.[PERSON] 618[DATE][DATE][PERSON] Summary of Costs and Benefits In section VIII.[PERSON]5 of this final rule, we set forth a detailed analysis of the impacts that the changes will have on affected entities and beneficiaries. The impacts include the following1. Impacts of the Final [ORGANIZATION] The impact table in section VIII.[PERSON]5.a of this final rule displays the estimated change in payments to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities in [ORGANIZATION] compared to estimated payments in [ORGANIZATION]5. The overall impact of the [ORGANIZATION] changes is projected to be a 2.5 percent increase in payments. PERSON8spital-based [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities have an estimated 3.3 percent increase in payments compared with freestanding facilities with an estimated 2.5 percent increase. We estimate that the aggregate [ORGANIZATION] expenditures will increase by approximately 290 million in [ORGANIZATION] compared to [ORGANIZATION]5. This reflects a [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]540 million increase from the payment rate update, a [DATE]0 million increase due to the updates to the outlier threshold amounts, and approximately 2.5 million in estimated [ORGANIZATION] payment amounts, as further described in the next paragraph. Because of the projected 2.5 percent overall payment increase, we estimate there will be an increase in beneficiary coinsurance payments of 2.5 percent in [ORGANIZATION], which translates to approximately 60 million. [ORGANIZATION]tion 1881b14Div of the [ORGANIZATION] provides that the [ORGANIZATION] may include such other payment adjustments as the [ORGANIZATION]retary determines appropriate. Under this authority, [PERSON] implemented [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236 to establish the [ORGANIZATION], a transitional add-on payment adjustment for new and innovative equipment and supplies, which is not budget neutral. As discussed in section II.[PERSON]1.a of this final rule, we have determined that [ORGANIZATION], a hemodialysis machine that has [PERSON] authorization for home use, has met the criteria for the [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] payment. We estimate that the overall [ORGANIZATION] payment amounts in [ORGANIZATION] would be approximately 2.5 million, of which, approximately 490,000 would be attributed to beneficiary coinsurance amounts.2. Impacts of the Final Payment for [ORGANIZATION] Furnished to Individuals With [ORGANIZATION] The impact table in section VIII.[PERSON]5.b of this final rule displays the estimated change in payments to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities in [ORGANIZATION] compared to estimated payments in [ORGANIZATION]5. The overall impact of the [ORGANIZATION] changes is projected to be a 1.9 percent increase in payments for individuals with [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON8spital-based [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities have an estimated 2.0 percent increase in payments compared with freestanding [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities with an estimated 1.9 percent increase. The overall impact reflects the effects of the updated wage index and the final payment rate update. We estimate that the aggregate payments made to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities for renal dialysis services furnished to patients with [ORGANIZATION], at the final [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] base rate, will increase by 1 million in [ORGANIZATION] compared to [ORGANIZATION]5.3. Impacts of [ORGANIZATION] Our finalized policy to suppress measures for the [DATE] [PERSON] and to revise the scoring and payment methodology such that no facility will receive a payment reduction necessitated a modification to our previous estimated overall economic impact of the [DATE] [PERSON] 84 FR [ZIP]. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we estimated that the overall economic impact of the [DATE] [PERSON] would be approximately [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]549 million as a result of the policies we had finalized at [DATE]5. The [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]549 million figure for [DATE] included costs associated with the collection of information requirements, which we estimated would be approximately 211 million, and 18 million in estimated payment reductions across all facilities. PERSON8wever, as a result of the policies we are finalizing in this final rule for the [DATE] [PERSON], we are modifying our previous estimate for [DATE]. We estimate that the new overall economic impact of the [DATE] [PERSON] will be approximately 215 million. The 215 million figure for [DATE] only includes the costs associated with the collection of information requirements because there will be no payment reductions in [DATE]. We estimate that the overall economic impact of the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] will be approximately 232 million, of which 215 million is associated with the collection of information requirements and 1[DATE] million is associated with the estimated payment reductions across all facilities. We also estimate that the overall economic impact of the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 [PERSON] will be approximately 232 million.4. Impacts of PERSON4ges to [ORGANIZATION] The impact estimate in section VIII.B.4 of this final rule describes the estimated change in anticipated [PERSON] program savings arising from [ORGANIZATION] over the duration of [ORGANIZATION] as a result of the changes in this final rule. We estimate that [ORGANIZATION] will result in 28 million in net savings over the [DATE]6 duration of [ORGANIZATION]. We also estimate that 5 million of the estimated 28 million in net savings will be attributable to changes in this final rule.II. [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION][PERSON]1. [PERSON] On [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, the ORG1 [PERSON] implemented [ORGANIZATION], a case-mix adjusted bundled [ORGANIZATION] for renal dialysis services furnished by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities, as required by section 1881b14 of [ORGANIZATION], as added by section 153b of [ORGANIZATION] of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 MIPP[PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]tion 1881b14F of the [ORGANIZATION], as added by section 153b of MIPPA and amended by section 3401h of [ORGANIZATION] and Affordable Care [ORGANIZATION] the Affordable Care [ORGANIZATION], established that beginning with [DATE][DATE], and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5, the [ORGANIZATION]retary of ORG[DATE] the [ORGANIZATION]retary shall [ORGANIZATION]1ly increase payment amounts by an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket increase factor reduced by the productivity adjustment described in section 18[DATE]b3BxiII of the [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]tion 632 of [ORGANIZATION] of [DATE]8 ATRA Pub. GPE25 112-240 included several provisions that apply to the [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]tion 632a of ATRA added section 1881b14I to the [ORGANIZATION], which required the [ORGANIZATION]retary, by comparing per patient utilization data from [DATE]9 with such data from [DATE]8, to reduce the single payment for renal dialysis services furnished on or after [ORGANIZATION] to reflect the [ORGANIZATION]retarys estimate of the change in the utilization of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]-related drugs and biologicals excluding oral-only [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]-related drugs. Consistent with this requirement, in the DATE51 [ORGANIZATION] final rule we finalized 29.93 as the total drug utilization reduction and finalized a policy to implement the amount over a 3- to [ORGANIZATION]8 transition period [DATE]8 FR [DATE]2161 through [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION]tion 632b of ATRA prohibited the [ORGANIZATION]retary from paying for oral-only [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]-related drugs and biologicals under the [ORGANIZATION] DATE[DATE]. [ORGANIZATION]tion 632c of ATRA required the [ORGANIZATION]retary, by DATE53, to analyze the case-mix payment adjustments under section 1881b14Di of the [ORGANIZATION] and make[PERSON] 618[DATE]8appropriate revisions to those adjustments. On DATE54, [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] of [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]. GPE25 113-93 was enacted. [ORGANIZATION]tion 21[DATE] of [ORGANIZATION] included several provisions that apply to the [ORGANIZATION]. Specifically, sections 21[DATE]b1 and 2 of [ORGANIZATION] amended sections 1881b14F and I of the [ORGANIZATION] and replaced the drug utilization adjustment that was finalized in the DATE51 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]8 FR [DATE]2161 through [DATE] with specific provisions that dictated the market basket update for DATE56 0.0 percent and how the market basket should be reduced in DATE5[DATE] through DATE58. [ORGANIZATION]tion 21[DATE]a1 of [ORGANIZATION] amended section 632b1 of ATRA to provide that the [ORGANIZATION]retary may not pay for oral-only [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]-related drugs under the [ORGANIZATION] prior to [PERSON]95anuary 1, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0. [ORGANIZATION]tion 21[DATE]a2 of [ORGANIZATION] further amended section 632b1 of ATRA by requiring that in establishing payment for oral-only drugs under the [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION]retary must use data from [ORGANIZATION]0 available. [ORGANIZATION]tion 21[DATE]c of [ORGANIZATION] provided that as part of the DATE5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION] rulemaking, the [ORGANIZATION]retary shall establish a process for 1 determining when a product is no longer an oral-only drug and 2 including new injectable and intravenous products into the [ORGANIZATION] bundled payment. Finally, on [DATE], [PERSON], the President signed the [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]., Achieving [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Experience [ORGANIZATION] of [PERSON] [PERSON]. GPE25 113-295. [ORGANIZATION]tion 204 of AB[ORGANIZATION]E amended section 632b1 of ATRA, as amended by section 21[DATE]a1 of [ORGANIZATION], to provide that payment for oral-only renal dialysis services cannot be made under the [ORGANIZATION] bundled payment prior to [PERSON]95anuary 1, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1.2. System for Payment of [ORGANIZATION] Under the [ORGANIZATION], a single per-treatment payment is made to an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility for all the renal dialysis services defined in section 1881b14B of the [ORGANIZATION] and furnished to individuals for the treatment of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] in the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility or in a patients home. We have codified our definition of renal dialysis services at [ORGANIZATION]. 413.1[DATE]1, which is in 42 [ORGANIZATION] part 413, subpart H, along with other [ORGANIZATION] payment policies. The [ORGANIZATION] base rate is adjusted for characteristics of both adult and pediatric patients and accounts for patient case-mix variability. The adult case-mix adjusters include five categories of age, body surface area, low body mass index, onset of dialysis, and four comorbidity categories that is, pericarditis, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, hereditary hemolytic or sickle cell anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome. A different set of case-mix adjusters are applied for the pediatric population. Pediatric patient-level adjusters include two age categories under [ORGANIZATION]3, or [ORGANIZATION]3-26 and two dialysis modalities that is, peritoneal or hemodialysis [ORGANIZATION]. 413.235a and b. The [ORGANIZATION] provides for three facility-level adjustments. The first payment adjustment accounts for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities furnishing a low volume of dialysis treatments [ORGANIZATION]. 413.232. The second adjustment reflects differences in area wage levels developed from core-based statistical areas [PERSON]0s [ORGANIZATION]. 413.2[DATE]. The third payment adjustment accounts for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities furnishing renal dialysis services in a rural area [ORGANIZATION]. 413.233. There are four additional payment adjustments under the [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] provides adjustments, when applicable, for 1 A training add-on for home and self-dialysis modalities [ORGANIZATION]. 413.235c 2 an additional payment for high cost outliers due to unusual variations in the type or amount of medically necessary care [ORGANIZATION]. 413.23[DATE] 3 a transitional drug add-on payment adjustment [PERSON][DATE] for certain new renal dialysis drugs and biological products [ORGANIZATION]. 413.234c and 4 a transitional add-on payment adjustment for new and innovative equipment and supplies [ORGANIZATION] for certain qualifying, new and innovative renal dialysis equipment and supplies [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236d.3. Updates to the [ORGANIZATION] Policy changes to the [ORGANIZATION] are proposed and finalized [ORGANIZATION]1ly in [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION] final rule was published on [ORGANIZATION][DATE] in [ORGANIZATION] [DATE]5 FR [ZIP] through [ZIP]. That rule implemented the [ORGANIZATION] beginning on [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 in accordance with section 1881b14 of the [ORGANIZATION], as added by section 153b of MIPPA, over a [ORGANIZATION]8 transition period. Since the implementation of the [ORGANIZATION], we have published [ORGANIZATION]1 rules to make routine updates, policy changes, and clarifications. On [DATE], [ORGANIZATION], we published a final rule in [ORGANIZATION] titled, [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION], Payment for [ORGANIZATION] Furnished to Individuals With Acute [PERSON], and End-Stage [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Incentive [ORGANIZATION], referred to herein as the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule. In that rule, we updated the [ORGANIZATION] base rate, wage index, and outlier policy, for [ORGANIZATION]5. We also finalized an update to the [ORGANIZATION] wage index to adopt the [PERSON] [PERSON]1 delineations with a transition period, changes to the eligibility criteria and determination process for the [ORGANIZATION], an expansion of the [ORGANIZATION] to include certain new and innovative capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines, an addition to the [ORGANIZATION] base rate to include calcimimetics in the [ORGANIZATION] bundled payment, and a change to the low-volume payment adjustment eligibility criteria and attestation requirement to account for the coronavirus disease [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] Public Health Emergency [PERSON]65. For further detailed information regarding these updates, see 85 FR [DATE]1398.B. Provisions of the Proposed Rule, Public Comments, and [ORGANIZATION] to the Comments on the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] The proposed rule, titled [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION], Payment for [ORGANIZATION] Furnished to Individuals With Acute [PERSON], End-Stage [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Incentive [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] Model [DATE] FR 363[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54 through [DATE], referred to as the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, was published in [ORGANIZATION] on DATE[DATE]1, with a comment period that ended on DATE[DATE]2. In that proposed rule, we proposed to make a number of [ORGANIZATION]1 updates for [ORGANIZATION], including updates to the [ORGANIZATION] base rate, wage index, outlier policy, and the offset amount for [ORGANIZATION] for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines used in the home. The proposed rule presented a summary of the two [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] applications that we received by the DATE[DATE]3 deadline and our analysis of the applicants claims related to substantial clinical improvement [PERSON]0I and other eligibility criteria for the TPNIEGPE13 We received 2[DATE] public comments on our proposals, including comments from kidney and dialysis organizations, such as large and small dialysis organizations, for-profit and non-profit [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] networks, and a dialysis coalition. We also received comments from patients [ORGANIZATION] providers for adult and pediatric [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] beneficiaries home dialysis services and advocacy organizations provider and legal advocacy organizations administrators and insurance groups ORG16, a professional association, and alliances for kidney care and home dialysis stakeholders drug and device manufacturers health care systems ORG1[DATE] solutions company and the [PERSON] Payment Advisory ORG[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54 ORG19. In this final rule, we provide a summary of each proposed provision, a summary of the public comments received and our responses to them, and the policies we are finalizing for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION].1. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Updatea. [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Bundled [ORGANIZATION] Market Basket Update, Productivity Adjustment, and [ORGANIZATION] In accordance with section 1881b14Fi of the [ORGANIZATION], as added by section 153b of MIPPA and amended by section 3401h of the Affordable Care [ORGANIZATION], beginning in [DATE]8, the [ORGANIZATION] payment amounts are required to be [ORGANIZATION]1ly increased by an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket increase factor and reduced by the productivity adjustment described in section 18[DATE]b3BxiII of the [ORGANIZATION]. The application of the productivity adjustment may result in the increase factor being less than 0.0 percent for DATE[DATE]4 and may result in payment rates for DATE[DATE]4 being less than the payment rates for DATE[DATE]5. The statute also provides that the market basket increase factor should reflect the changes over time in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services used to furnish renal dialysis services. As required under section 1881b14Fi of the [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] developed an all-inclusive [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Bundled [ORGANIZATION] input price index [DATE]5 FR [ZIP] through [DATE]. In the DATE56 [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we rebased and revised the [ORGANIZATION] input price index to reflect a [DATE]8 base [ORGANIZATION]20 [DATE]9 FR [ZIP] through [ZIP]. Subsequently, in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we finalized a rebased [ORGANIZATION] input price index to reflect DATE[DATE][DATE] 83 FR [ZIP] through [DATE]. Although market basket technically describes the mix of goods and services used for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] treatment, this term is also commonly used to denote the input price index that is, cost categories, their respective weights, and price proxies combined derived from a market basket. Accordingly, the term [ORGANIZATION] market basket, as used in this document, refers to the [ORGANIZATION] input price index. We proposed to use the DATE5[DATE]-based [ORGANIZATION] market basket as finalized and described in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 83 FR [ZIP] through [DATE] to compute the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] market basket increase factor based on the best available data. Consistent with historical practice, we proposed to estimate the [ORGANIZATION] market basket update based on [PERSON] forecast using the most recently available data. [PERSON]1 is a nationally recognized economic and financial forecasting firm with which we contract to forecast the components of the market baskets. Using this methodology and the [PERSON]1 DATE[DATE]8 forecast of the DATE5[DATE]-based [ORGANIZATION] market basket with historical data through [DATE] of [ORGANIZATION], the proposed [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] market basket increase factor was 1.6 percent. Under section 1881b14Fi of the [ORGANIZATION], for [DATE][DATE] and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5, the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket percentage increase factor shall be reduced by the productivity adjustment described in section 18[DATE]b3BxiII of the [ORGANIZATION]. The productivity adjustment is calculated using a projection of multifactor productivity [ORGANIZATION], which is derived by subtracting the contribution of labor and capital input growth from output growth. We finalized the detailed methodology for deriving the projection of [ORGANIZATION] in the [DATE][DATE] [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]6 FR [ZIP] through [ZIP]. The most up-to-date [ORGANIZATION] projection methodology is available on the [PERSON] website at We noted in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule that for [ORGANIZATION] and beyond, we are changing the name of this adjustment to refer to it as the productivity adjustment, which is the term used in sections 1881b14Fi and 18[DATE]b3BxiII of the [ORGANIZATION], rather than the multifactor productivity or [ORGANIZATION] adjustment. This is not a change in policy, as we will continue to use the same methodology for deriving the adjustment and rely on the same underlying data. Using this methodology and the [PERSON]1 DATE[DATE]8 forecast, the proposed productivity adjustment for [ORGANIZATION] the [ORGANIZATION]0 moving average of [ORGANIZATION] for the period ending [ORGANIZATION] was 0.6 percent. As a result of these provisions, the proposed [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket increase factor reduced by the productivity adjustment was 1.0 percent. The proposed market basket increase factor is calculated by starting with the proposed [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] market basket percentage increase factor of 1.6 percent and reducing it by the proposed productivity adjustment the [ORGANIZATION]0 moving average of [ORGANIZATION] for the period ending [ORGANIZATION] of 0.6 percent. As is our general practice, we proposed that if more recent data became available after the publication of the proposed rule and before the publication of the final rule for example, a more recent estimate of the DATE5[DATE]-based [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket increase factor or productivity adjustment, we would use such data, if appropriate, to determine the final [ORGANIZATION] market basket update and productivity adjustment in this final rule 85 FR 3632[DATE]. We invited public comment on our proposals for the [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket update and productivity adjustment. The following is a summary of the public comments received on these proposals and our responses. Comment Several commenters encouraged [PERSON] to examine the data sources and other elements to ensure that the market basket update reflects [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities current experience. The commenters stated that while they understand [PERSON] must follow the statutory framework for the [ORGANIZATION]1 market basket update, they believe that the proposed [ORGANIZATION] market basket update appears low given inflation and rising expenses including rent and labor. Several commenters expressed that they support the proposed [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]1 payment rate update for [ORGANIZATION] and support the use of more recent data for the market basket update and productivity adjustment, if available, to determine the final update factors for [ORGANIZATION]. ORG19 commented that while it recognizes that [PERSON] must provide the statutorily mandated payment update of the market basket minus the productivity adjustment, the ORG[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54 has concluded that this increase is not warranted based on their analysis of payment adequacy, which includes an assessment of beneficiary access, supply of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities, and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities access to capital, quality, and financial indicators for the sector. ORG19 further recommended that [PERSON]3 should eliminate the update to the [ORGANIZATION] base rate for [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] We acknowledge the concerns of some of the commenters and appreciate the support of some of the commenters regarding the proposed [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]1 payment rate update and use of more recent data to determine the market basket and productivity adjustment in determination of the final update factor. We also appreciate ORG19s comments but note that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket increase factor is mandated by statute. For this final rule, we have incorporated more current historical data and revised forecasts provided by [PERSON]1 that factor in expected price and wage pressures. By incorporating the most recent estimates available of the market basket update[PERSON] 61880and productivity adjustment, we believe these data reflect the best available projection of input price inflation faced by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities for [ORGANIZATION], adjusted for economy-wide productivity, which is required by statute. As stated previously in this section of the final rule, consistent with our proposal to use more recent data, the [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket increase factor is 1.9 percent based on the more recent [PERSON]1 [ORGANIZATION]2 forecast. Comment A few commenters noted that while they understand that the productivity adjustment is statutorily required, they believe that the experience of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities argues against the idea that productivity can be improved [ORGANIZATION]3. [ORGANIZATION] We acknowledge the commenters concerns regarding productivity growth at the economy-wide level and its application to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities. As the commenter acknowledges, however, section 1881b14Fi of the [ORGANIZATION] requires the application of the productivity adjustment described in section 18[DATE]b3BxiII of the [ORGANIZATION] to the [ORGANIZATION] market basket increase factor for [DATE]8 and [ORGANIZATION]4. We will continue to monitor the impact of the payment updates, including the effects of the productivity adjustment, on [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] provider margins as well as beneficiary access to care as reported by ORG19. Comment One commenter recommended [PERSON] replace the current price proxy for the [ORGANIZATION] cost weight in the [ORGANIZATION]5-based [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket Producer Price Index PPI--Commodity--Vitamin, nutrient, and hematinic preparations with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], [DATE] adjusted [ORGANIZATION]. The commenter further stated that they do not believe that the current proxy appropriately captures the price of drugs that fall within this category as they are not over-the-counter vitamins but prescription-only, synthesized hormones. The commenter also noted that there are new drugs under development currently that likely will be added to the [ORGANIZATION] bundled payment during DATE[DATE]. The commenter asserted that an alternative proxy for the [PERSON]5 drugs should be based on prescription drugs rather than the current proxy. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the commenters suggestion and share the commenters desire to use the most appropriate price proxy for [PERSON]5 drugs in the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket. As described in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 83 FR [ZIP] through [ZIP], and in the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 [ORGANIZATION], we believe the PPI for [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] is the most appropriate price proxy for [PERSON]5 drugs and analysis of [ORGANIZATION] data for [PERSON]6 drugs in the [ORGANIZATION] bundled payment suggests the trends in the PPI VNHP trends are reasonable. We appreciate the commenters concern about the potential shifts in the mix of drugs within the [ORGANIZATION] bundled payment as new drugs enter the market. We will continue to monitor the impact that these changes have on the relative cost share weights and the mix of [PERSON]6 drugs included in the [ORGANIZATION] bundled payment in the [ORGANIZATION] market basket, and propose changes if appropriate in future rulemaking. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion After considering the public comments, consistent with our historical practice and our proposal, we are estimating the market basket increase and the productivity adjustment based on [PERSON]1s forecast using the most recent available data. Based on [PERSON]1s [ORGANIZATION]2 forecast of the [ORGANIZATION]5-based [ORGANIZATION] market basket with historical data through [ORGANIZATION][DATE], the [ORGANIZATION]5-based [ORGANIZATION] market basket update for [ORGANIZATION] is 2.4 percent. [PERSON]1s [ORGANIZATION]8 [ORGANIZATION]9 forecast reflects a higher [ORGANIZATION] inflationary outlook compared to [PERSON]1s [ORGANIZATION]8 DATE90 forecast, which is resulting in a notable upward revision to the [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket update for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 2.4 percent compared to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule 1.6 percent. As the economic impacts of the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic ease, the relatively higher inflation is resulting in relatively higher projected growth in wage, medical materials and supplies, and capital prices. Based on the more recent data available from [PERSON]1s [ORGANIZATION]2 forecast, the current estimate of the productivity adjustment for [ORGANIZATION] the [ORGANIZATION]0 moving average of [ORGANIZATION] for the period ending [ORGANIZATION]5 is 0.5 percentage point. Therefore, the final [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket adjusted for the productivity adjustment is projected to be 1.9 percent 2.4 percent market basket update reduced by 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. For the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] payment update, we proposed to continue using a labor-related share of [DATE].3 percent for the [ORGANIZATION] payment, which was finalized in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 83 FR [ZIP]. We invited public comment on the proposed labor-related share for [ORGANIZATION]. We did not receive any comments on the proposal to continue using a labor-related share of [DATE].3 percent for [ORGANIZATION] and, therefore, are finalizing the continued use of a [DATE].3 percent labor-related share as proposed.b. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Wage Indices1 [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]tion 1881b14DivII of the [ORGANIZATION] provides that the [ORGANIZATION] may include a geographic wage index payment adjustment, such as the index referred to in section 1881b12D of the [ORGANIZATION], as the [ORGANIZATION]retary determines to be appropriate. In the [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]5 FR [ZIP], we finalized an adjustment for wages at [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON], [PERSON] adjusts the labor-related portion of the base rate to account for geographic differences in the area wage levels using an appropriate wage index, which reflects the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs in the geographic area in which the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility is located. We use [PERSON]9 [PERSON]0-based geographic area designations to define urban and rural areas and their corresponding wage index values [DATE]5 FR [DATE]. [PERSON]1 publishes bulletins regarding [PERSON]0 changes, including changes to [PERSON]0 numbers and titles. The bulletins are available online at For [ORGANIZATION], we proposed to update the wage indices to account for updated wage levels in areas in which [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities are located using our existing methodology. We use the most recent pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage data collected [ORGANIZATION]1ly under the inpatient PPGPE13 The [ORGANIZATION] wage index values are calculated without regard to geographic reclassifications authorized under sections 18[DATE]d8 and d10 of the [ORGANIZATION] and utilize prefloor hospital data that are unadjusted for occupational mix. For [ORGANIZATION], the updated wage data are for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after DATE92, and before [DATE], [PERSON] fiscal [ORGANIZATION]20 FY [PERSON] cost report data. We have also adopted methodologies for calculating wage index values for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities that are located in urban and rural areas where there is no hospital data. For a full discussion, see [ORGANIZATION]6 and [DATE][DATE] [ORGANIZATION] final rules at [DATE]5 FR [ZIP] through [DATE] and [DATE]6 FR [DATE]0239 through [DATE]0241, respectively. For urban areas with no hospital data, we compute the average wage index value of all urban areas within the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] to serve as a reasonable[PERSON] 61881proxy for the wage index of that urban [PERSON]0, that is, we use that value as the wage index. For rural areas with no hospital data, we compute the wage index using the average wage index values from all contiguous [PERSON]0s to represent a reasonable proxy for that rural area. We apply the statewide urban average based on the average of all urban areas within the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] to [PERSON], GPE2 [DATE]8 FR [DATE]21[DATE]3, and we apply the wage index for [PERSON] to [PERSON] and GPE5 [DATE]8 FR [DATE]21[DATE]2. A wage index floor value 0.5000 is applied under the [ORGANIZATION] as a substitute wage index for areas with very low wage index values. Currently, all areas with wage index values that fall below the floor are located in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. PERSON8wever, the wage index floor value is applicable for any area that may fall below the floor. A description of the history of the wage index floor under the [ORGANIZATION] can be found in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 83 FR [ZIP] through [DATE]. An [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilitys wage index is applied to the labor-related share of the [ORGANIZATION] base rate. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 83 FR [ZIP], we finalized a labor-related share of [DATE].3 percent, which is based on the [ORGANIZATION]5-based [ORGANIZATION] market basket. In the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR [DATE]1436, we updated the [PERSON]1 delineations as described in the [ORGANIZATION]3 [PERSON]1 Bulletin No. 18-04, beginning with the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] wage index. In addition, we finalized the application of a 5 percent cap on any decrease in an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilitys wage index from the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilitys wage index from DATE95. We finalized that the transition would be phased in over DATE96, such that the reduction in an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilitys wage index would be capped at 5 percent in [ORGANIZATION]5, and no cap would be applied to the reduction in the wage index for DATE9[DATE], [ORGANIZATION]. Thus, for [ORGANIZATION], the labor-related share to which a facilitys wage index would be applied is [DATE].3 percent. The comments received on the proposed [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] wage index and our responses to the comments are set forth below. Comment A coalition of dialysis organizations and a professional association acknowledged and supported the final phase-in of the updated [PERSON]1 delineations for [ORGANIZATION]. These commenters, along with another large dialysis organization, suggested that [PERSON] consider ways to better tailor the [ORGANIZATION] wage index, including using additional data beyond the hospital wage data. Another small dialysis organization expressed concerns that the [ORGANIZATION] wage index does not keep pace with the hospital wage index, and identified several potential changes to align the [ORGANIZATION] wage index with the hospital wage index, including the application of a statewide rural floor on wage indices, the application of different labor-related share percentages for areas with wage indices above and below 1, and allowing [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities to reclassify to a different geographic area. Another commenter, a non-profit kidney care alliance, expressed similar concerns and urged [PERSON] to promptly address these disparities between the [ORGANIZATION] wage index and the hospital wage index in rulemaking in the near future. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support, and we appreciate the suggestions for improving the [ORGANIZATION] wage index. We did not propose changes to the [ORGANIZATION] wage index methodology for [ORGANIZATION], and therefore we are not finalizing any changes to that methodology in this final rule. PERSON8wever, we will take these comments into consideration to potentially inform future rulemaking. Comment Three commenters, including a large dialysis organization, a non-profit health insurance organization in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], and a [ORGANIZATION] group in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], commented on the wage index for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities located in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. These commenters recommended that [PERSON] increase the wage index floor from 0.5000 to 0.5500 they noted that in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, [PERSON] reported that its own analysis indicated that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]s wage index likely lies between 0.5100 and 0.5500 They noted that [PERSON] further stated that any wage index values less than 0.5936 are considered outlier values. They pointed out that [PERSON] still finalized a floor at 0.50 and characterized it as a balance between providing additional payments to affected areas while minimizing the impact on the [ORGANIZATION] base rate. The commenters also recommended that [PERSON] align the [ORGANIZATION] wage index with the hospital wage index by applying to the [ORGANIZATION] wage index the policy finalized in the FY [ORGANIZATION] I[ORGANIZATION] final rule 84 FR [ZIP] through [DATE] that increases the wage index for hospitals with a wage index value below the 25th percentile wage index. Two of the commenters further suggested that [PERSON] conduct a survey of registered nurse [ORGANIZATION] and health worker wages specifically in standalone [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] as a means for wage index reform, noting that there is specific professional scope of practice standards for technicians in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] outpatient facilities. Commenters asserted that [ORGANIZATION]s must provide all [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] care in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] outpatient facilities per local scope of practice laws, and that [PERSON] should evaluate inpatient and outpatient facility data separately in order to get a fully accurate projection of wage costs for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] providers in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. Another commenter recommended that [PERSON] evaluate policy inequities between the [ORGANIZATION] wage index for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities located in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] compared to other states and territories, taking into consideration the unique circumstances that affect [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], including its shortage of [ORGANIZATION] specialists and labor work force, remote geography, transportation and freighting costs, drug pricing, and lack of transitional care services. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for sharing their concerns regarding the [ORGANIZATION] wage index for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] and their suggestions for wage index reform. As noted in the DATE58 [ORGANIZATION] final rule 82 FR 50[DATE]4[DATE] and the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 83 FR [ZIP] through [DATE], we have received conflicting information from commenters about the local scope of practice for [ORGANIZATION]s and other staff impact on facility costs in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. Since we did not propose any changes to the wage index floor or wage index methodology for [ORGANIZATION], we are not finalizing any changes to those policies in this final rule. PERSON8wever, we appreciate the concerns that commenters have raised and we will take these thoughtful suggestions into account when considering future rulemaking. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion We are finalizing the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] wage indices based on the latest hospital wage data as proposed. For [ORGANIZATION], the labor-related share to which a facilitys wage index is applied is [DATE].3 percent. As we finalized in the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR [DATE]1436, there will be no cap applied to the reduction in the [ORGANIZATION] wage index for [ORGANIZATION]. The final [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] wage index is set forth in [PERSON] A and is available on the [PERSON] website at [PERSON] A provides a crosswalk between the [ORGANIZATION]5 wage index and the [ORGANIZATION] wage index. [PERSON] B provides an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility level impact analysis. [PERSON] B is available on the [PERSON] website at 61882Renal-Disease-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]-Payment-Regulations-and-[DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] Update to the [PERSON] Policy [ORGANIZATION]tion 1881b14Dii of the [ORGANIZATION] requires that the [ORGANIZATION] include a payment adjustment for high cost outliers due to unusual variations in the type or amount of medically necessary care, including variability in the amount of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ESAs necessary for anemia management. Some examples of the patient conditions that may be reflective of higher facility costs when furnishing dialysis care would be frailty, obesity, and comorbidities, such as secondary hyperparathyroidism. The [ORGANIZATION] recognizes high cost patients, and we have codified the outlier policy and our methodology for calculating outlier payments at [ORGANIZATION]. 413.23[DATE] The policy provides that the following [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] outlier items and services are included in the [ORGANIZATION] bundle 1 Renal dialysis drugs and biological products that were or would have been, prior to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, separately billable under [PERSON] Part B 2 renal dialysis laboratory tests that were or would have been, prior to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, separately billable under [PERSON] Part B  3 renal dialysis medicalsurgical supplies, including syringes, used to administer renal dialysis drugs and biological products that were or would have been, prior to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, separately billable under [PERSON] Part B 4 renal dialysis drugs and biological products that were or would have been, prior to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, covered under [PERSON] Part D, including renal dialysis oral-only drugs effective [PERSON]95anuary 1, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 and 5 renal dialysis equipment and supplies, except for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines as defined in [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE], that receive the transitional add-on payment adjustment as specified in [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236 after the payment period has ended. In the [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]5 FR [ZIP], [PERSON] stated that for purposes of determining whether an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility would be eligible for an outlier payment, it would be necessary for the facility to identify the actual [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] outlier services furnished to the patient by line item that is, date of service on the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]01 claim. Renal dialysis drugs, laboratory tests, and medicalsurgical supplies that are recognized as outlier services were specified in Transmittal [DATE], dated DATE[ORGANIZATION] Furthermore, [PERSON] uses administrative issuances to update the renal dialysis service items available for outlier payment via our DATEORG1[DATE] update [PERSON] PERSON4ge Requests, when applicable. For example, we use these updates to identify renal dialysis service drugs that were or would have been covered under [PERSON] Part D for outlier eligibility purposes and items and services that have been incorrectly identified as eligible outlier services.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Transmittal 2033 issued [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]04 was rescinded and replaced by Transmittal [DATE], dated [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]05. Transmittal [DATE] identified additional drugs and laboratory tests that may also be eligible for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] outlier payment. Transmittal [DATE] was rescinded and replaced by Transmittal [DATE], dated [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]06, which included one technical correction. Under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.23[DATE], an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility is eligible for an outlier payment if its actual or imputed [PERSON] Allowable Payment [ORGANIZATION] amount per treatment for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] outlier services exceeds a threshold. The [ORGANIZATION] amount represents the average incurred amount per treatment for services that were or would have been considered separately billable services prior to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2. The threshold is equal to the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilitys predicted [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] outlier services [ORGANIZATION] amount per treatment which is case-mix adjusted and described in the following paragraphs plus the fixed-dollar loss [ORGANIZATION] amount. In accordance with [ORGANIZATION]. 413.23[DATE]c, facilities are paid 80 percent of the per treatment amount by which the imputed [ORGANIZATION] amount for outlier services that is, the actual incurred amount exceeds this threshold. [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities are eligible to receive outlier payments for treating both adult and pediatric dialysis patients. In the [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION] final rule and codified in [ORGANIZATION]. 413.[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]540b4, using [DATE]9 data, we established the outlier percentage, which is used to reduce the per treatment base rate to account for the proportion of the estimated total payments under the [ORGANIZATION] that are outlier payments, at 1.0 percent of total payments [DATE]5 FR [ZIP] through [ZIP]. We also established the [ORGANIZATION] amounts that are added to the predicted outlier services [ORGANIZATION] amounts. The outlier services [ORGANIZATION] amounts and [ORGANIZATION] amounts are different for adult and pediatric patients due to differences in the utilization of separately billable services among adult and pediatric patients [DATE]5 FR [ZIP]. As we explained in the [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]5 FR [ZIP] through [DATE], the predicted outlier services [ORGANIZATION] amounts for a patient are determined by multiplying the adjusted average outlier services [ORGANIZATION] amount by the product of the patient-specific case-mix adjusters applicable using the outlier services payment multipliers developed from the regression analysis used to compute the payment adjustments. For [ORGANIZATION], we proposed that the outlier services [ORGANIZATION] amounts and [ORGANIZATION] amounts would be derived from claims data from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. As we stated in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], we believe that any adjustments made to the [ORGANIZATION] amounts under the [ORGANIZATION] should be based upon the most recent datDATE[DATE]4 available to best predict any future outlier payments therefore, we proposed the outlier thresholds for [ORGANIZATION] would be based on utilization of renal dialysis items and services furnished under the [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. We also stated that we recognize that the utilization of ESAs and other outlier services have continued to decline under the [ORGANIZATION], and that we have lowered the [ORGANIZATION] amounts and [ORGANIZATION] amounts [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]08 under the [ORGANIZATION]. As discussed in [ORGANIZATION] of this final rule, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] claims data show outlier payments represent approximately 0.6 percent of total payments.1 [ORGANIZATION] Update to the [PERSON] Services [ORGANIZATION] Amounts and [ORGANIZATION] Amounts For this final rule, the outlier services [ORGANIZATION] amounts and [ORGANIZATION] amounts were updated using [ORGANIZATION] claims data, as we proposed to do for [ORGANIZATION]. The impact of this update is shown in Table 1, which compares the outlier services [ORGANIZATION] amounts and [ORGANIZATION] amounts used for the outlier policy in [ORGANIZATION]5 with the updated estimates for this final rule. The estimates for the [ORGANIZATION] outlier policy, which are included in Column II of Table 1, were inflation adjusted to reflect projected [DATE]1 prices for outlier services.[PERSON] 61883GRAPHIC [ORGANIZATION] OMITTED TR08NO21.000 As demonstrated in Table 1, the estimated [ORGANIZATION] amount per treatment that determines the [ORGANIZATION] outlier threshold amount for adults Column II [DATE]5.39 is lower than that used for the [ORGANIZATION]5 outlier policy Column I 1[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54.49. The lower threshold is accompanied by a decrease in the adjusted average [ORGANIZATION] for outlier services from 50.92 to 42.[DATE]5 For pediatric patients, there is a decrease in the [ORGANIZATION] amount from 44.[DATE]8 to 26.02 There is a corresponding decrease in the adjusted average [ORGANIZATION] for outlier services among pediatric patients, from 30.08 to 2[DATE].15 We estimate that the percentage of patient [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 qualifying for outlier payments in [ORGANIZATION] will be [DATE].08 percent for adult patients and 12.89 percent for pediatric patients, based on the [ORGANIZATION] claims data. The outlier [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] amounts continue to be lower for pediatric patients than adults due to the continued lower use of outlier services primarily reflecting lower use of ESAs and other injectable drugs.2 [PERSON] Percentage In the [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]5 FR [ZIP] and under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]540b4, we reduced the per treatment base rate by 1 percent to account for the proportion of the estimated total payments under the [ORGANIZATION] that are outlier payments as described in [ORGANIZATION]. 413.23[DATE] Based on the [ORGANIZATION] claims, outlier payments represented approximately 0.6 percent of total payments, which is below the 1 percent target due to declines in the use of outlier services. As we stated in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], recalibration of the thresholds using [ORGANIZATION] data is expected to result in aggregate outlier payments close to the 1 percent target in [ORGANIZATION]. We stated in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule that we believe the update to the outlier [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] amounts for [ORGANIZATION] would increase payments for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] beneficiaries requiring higher resource utilization. This would move us closer to meeting our 1 percent outlier policy goal, because we are using more current data for computing the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], which is more in line with current outlier services utilization rates. We noted in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule that recalibration of the [ORGANIZATION] amounts would result in no change in payments to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities for beneficiaries with renal dialysis items and services that are not eligible for outlier payments. The comments and our responses to the comments on our proposed updates to the outlier policy are set forth below. Comment Several commenters suggested alternatives to our proposed outlier [ORGANIZATION] amounts, [ORGANIZATION] amounts, and outlier percentage target for [ORGANIZATION]. One large dialysis organization commented in support of using the most recent available [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] claims data for determining the [ORGANIZATION] outlier services [ORGANIZATION] amounts and [ORGANIZATION] amounts, but suggested that [PERSON] undertake further action to address the issue of outlier payments falling short of the 1 percent target. A professional organization of pediatric nephrologists expressed concern that the decreasing [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] amounts suggest that the cost of delivering pediatric [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] care is not appropriately paid under [PERSON] by either the existing [ORGANIZATION] bundled payment or through the outlier adjustment. Several commenters recommended that [PERSON] set the [ORGANIZATION] outlier percentage less than 1 percent. For example, one commenter, a coalition of dialysis organizations, suggested that because the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] claims data showed that outlier payments represented approximately 0.6 percent of total [ORGANIZATION] payments, [PERSON] could set the [ORGANIZATION] outlier pool percentage at 0.6 percent. Similarly, a professional association suggested that because historical data shows that [PERSON] regularly pays out between 0.5 and 0.6 percent of [ORGANIZATION] payments as outlier payments, [PERSON] should reduce the outlier percentage to better match the use of the outlier pool. Other commenters, including a large dialysis organization and a provider advocacy organization, urged [PERSON] to reduce the [ORGANIZATION] outlier pool to no more than 0.5 percent of projected[PERSON] 61884aggregate [ORGANIZATION] spending. Another large dialysis organization recommended [PERSON] adopt the proposed [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] amounts for [ORGANIZATION], but urged [PERSON] to set the outlier percentage to 0.6 percent. Additionally, several of these commenters suggested that in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]10 when the outlier pool retains dollars that are not paid out, [PERSON] should return those dollars to providers or reallocate those dollars to support reducing the barriers that create inequities in the care dialysis patients receive. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the support for the proposed use of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] data and the thoughtful suggestions provided by commenters. We acknowledge that, even with [ORGANIZATION]1ly adjusting the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to reflect the most recent utilization and costs of [ORGANIZATION] eligible outlier services, total outlier payments have not yet reached the 1 percent target. PERSON8wever, it is also true that use of eligible [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] outlier services declined [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]11. That is, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities incurred lower costs than anticipated, and those savings accrued to facilities more than offsetting the extent to which the consequent outlier payments fell short of the 1.0 percent target. We also note that declining [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] amounts do not in themselves suggest that the [ORGANIZATION] fails to adequately pay for the delivery of either pediatric or adult [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] care. Rather, the [ORGANIZATION] outlier policy was established to account for unusual variations in the type or amount of medically necessary care. Declining [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] amounts suggest that there is less costly variation in such care that is not included in the [ORGANIZATION] bundled payment. We appreciate the comments suggesting solutions for refining the outlier policy methodology, for example, reducing the outlier percentage withhold to less than 1 percent or establishing a mechanism that pays back [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities those allocated outlier amounts that did not pay out in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]12. We did not propose any modifications to the [ORGANIZATION] outlier policy for [ORGANIZATION], so we are not finalizing any changes to the methodology in this final rule. PERSON8wever, as discussed in section VI.E of the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], [PERSON] is considering potential revisions to the calculation of the outlier percentage to address stakeholder concerns, including concerns about the 1 percent outlier percentage, and issued a request for information in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule to seek feedback on the acceptability of possible payment adjustment methods and to solicit information that would better inform future modifications to the methodology through rulemaking. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion After considering the public comments, we are finalizing the updated outlier thresholds for [ORGANIZATION] displayed in Column II of Table 1 of this final rule and based on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] data.d. Final Impacts to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Base Rate1 [ORGANIZATION] Base Rate In the [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]5 FR 490[DATE]1 through [DATE], [PERSON] established the methodology for calculating the [ORGANIZATION] per-treatment base rate, that is, [ORGANIZATION] base rate, and calculating the per treatment payment amount, which are codified at [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. 413.[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]540 and 413.230 The [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION] final rule also provides a detailed discussion of the methodology used to calculate the [ORGANIZATION] base rate and the computation of factors used to adjust the [ORGANIZATION] base rate for projected outlier payments and budget neutrality in accordance with sections 1881b14Dii and 1881b14Aii of the [ORGANIZATION], respectively. Specifically, the [ORGANIZATION] base rate was developed from [ORGANIZATION] [DATE]9 claims that is, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]14 as required by section 1881b14Aii of the [ORGANIZATION], updated to [ORGANIZATION]6, and represented the average per treatment [ORGANIZATION] for composite rate and separately billable services. In accordance with section 1881b14D of the [ORGANIZATION] and our regulation at [ORGANIZATION]. 413.230, the per-treatment payment amount is the sum of the [ORGANIZATION] base rate, adjusted for the patient specific case-mix adjustments, applicable facility adjustments, geographic differences in area wage levels using an area wage index, and any applicable outlier payment, training adjustment add-on, [PERSON][DATE], and TPNIEGPE132 [ORGANIZATION]0 Payment Rate Update for [ORGANIZATION] We are finalizing an [ORGANIZATION] base rate for [ORGANIZATION] of 25[DATE].90 This update reflects several factors, described in more detail as follows [ORGANIZATION] We compute a wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor that is applied to the [ORGANIZATION] base rate. For [ORGANIZATION], we did not propose any changes to the methodology used to calculate this factor, which is described in detail in the DATE51 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]8 FR [DATE]21[DATE]4. We computed the final [ORGANIZATION] wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor using treatment counts from the [ORGANIZATION] claims and facility-specific [ORGANIZATION]5 payment rates to estimate the total dollar amount that each [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility would have received in [ORGANIZATION]5. The total of these payments became the target amount of expenditures for all [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities for [ORGANIZATION]. Next, we computed the estimated dollar amount that would have been paid for the same [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities using the [ORGANIZATION] wage index for [ORGANIZATION]. As discussed in section [PERSON] of this final rule, the [ORGANIZATION] wage index for [ORGANIZATION] includes an update to the most recent hospital wage data, use of the [PERSON] [PERSON]1 delineations, and no cap on wage index decreases applied for [ORGANIZATION]. The total of these payments becomes the new [ORGANIZATION] amount of wage-adjusted expenditures for all [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities. The wage index budget-neutrality factor is calculated as the target amount divided by the new [ORGANIZATION] amount. When we multiplied the wage index budget neutrality factor by the applicable [ORGANIZATION] estimated payments, aggregate payments to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities would remain budget neutral when compared to the target amount of expenditures. That is, the wage index budget neutrality adjustment factor ensures that wage index adjustments do not increase or decrease aggregate [PERSON] payments with respect to changes in wage index updates. The [ORGANIZATION] wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor is 0.[ZIP] This application would yield a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] base rate of 253.09 prior to the application of the market basket increase 253.13 x 0.[ZIP]  253.09. Market Basket Increase [ORGANIZATION]tion 1881b14FiI of the [ORGANIZATION] provides that, beginning in [DATE]8, the [ORGANIZATION] payment amounts are required to be [ORGANIZATION]1ly increased by the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] market basket percentage increase factor. The latest [ORGANIZATION] projection of the [ORGANIZATION] market basket percentage increase factor is 2.4 percent. In [ORGANIZATION], this amount must be reduced by the productivity adjustment described in section 18[DATE]b3BxiII of the [ORGANIZATION], as required by section 1881b14FiII of the [ORGANIZATION]. As discussed previously in section II.B.1.a of this final rule, the final productivity adjustment for [ORGANIZATION]5 is 0.5 percent, thus yielding an update to the base rate of 1.9 percent for [ORGANIZATION]. Therefore, the final [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed base rate is 25[DATE].90 253.02 x 1.019  25[DATE].90. The comments and our responses to the comments on our updates to the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] base rate are set forth below. Comment Several commenters raised concerns about the comorbidity case-mix adjustments under the [ORGANIZATION][PERSON] 61885and recommended eliminating them for [ORGANIZATION]. Two commenters, including a large dialysis organization and a coalition of dialysis organizations encouraged [PERSON] to eliminate the remaining comorbidity case-mix adjustments and thereby increase the [ORGANIZATION] base rate for [ORGANIZATION]. These commenters noted that the percent of claims with these conditions is relatively low and has been declining over time. These commenters argued that as the frequency of these conditions declines in the claims, maintaining these adjusters results in the loss of money from the system that could be redirected toward patient care. One of these commenters further argued that this means the dollars that [PERSON]3 intended to go to providing items and services for individuals who receive dialysis are being inappropriately diverted away from that care. Both commenters further suggested that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]24s of discussion pertaining to patient-level adjustments, particularly the issues with the comorbid case-mix adjusters, and [PERSON]s questions through the request for information [ORGANIZATION] in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, should constitute enough notice to support their removal from the regression model for [ORGANIZATION], which includes the co-morbid case-mix adjusters in the calculation of the [ORGANIZATION] payment. [ORGANIZATION] As the commenters noted, we included a detailed [ORGANIZATION] regarding the [ORGANIZATION] case mix adjustments in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule 82 FR [ZIP] through [DATE]. A summary of the comments received in response to the [ORGANIZATION] is provided in section VI.A of this final rule, and we will provide further information on the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] website in the future. [PERSON] is considering alternative approaches to calculating the [ORGANIZATION] case-mix adjustments that directly address stakeholder concerns, and appropriately reflect resource use and costs. The [ORGANIZATION] in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule both sought feedback on the variation of case-mix adjustments with duration of dialysis treatment, and solicited information on alternative proxies for resource utilization that can be reported at the patienttreatment level in order to better inform future modifications to this methodology through rulemaking. With regard to the comment about removing the co-morbid adjustment from the case-mix for [ORGANIZATION], we note that due to the nature of regression analysis, which is how the current payment adjustors are set, making that type of adjustment would affect all the patient-level and facility-level adjustments. This can impact budget neutrality requirements and affect provider impacts differently than if adopted incrementally. Payment system changes can also require extensive efforts by [PERSON] and providers to implement, and could not be implemented for [ORGANIZATION]. While we discussed these case-mix adjustments in the [ORGANIZATION], we did not propose to make changes to the comorbidity case-mix adjustments for [ORGANIZATION] therefore, we are not finalizing any changes to that policy in this final rule. Comment Two commenters, a large dialysis organization and a non-profit health insurance organization in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], urged [PERSON] to evaluate the accuracy of the [ORGANIZATION] base rate as applied to payments for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities located in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. These commenters encouraged [PERSON] to consider the differences in patient characteristics between [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] and the mainland [PERSON] , as well as differences in size, service capacity, and locality between the average [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] versus other mainland providers. [ORGANIZATION] As mentioned previously in this section of the final rule, and as further discussed in section VI.D of the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], [PERSON] is considering alternative approaches to calculating the case-mix adjustment, including duration of dialysis treatment to allocate composite rate costs for patients with higher resource use due to patient characteristics as reflected in the case-mix adjustments. We are also considering all the commenters suggestions in response to the [ORGANIZATION] for alternative proxies for allocation of composite rate costs for those patients whose medical and physiologic characteristics require more resource use. We appreciate these comments and will take them into consideration to potentially inform future rulemaking. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion We are finalizing a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] base rate of 25[DATE].90 This amount reflects the [ORGANIZATION] wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor of 0.[ZIP], and the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] productivity-adjusted market basket update of 1.9 percent.e. Update to [ORGANIZATION] for PERSON8me [ORGANIZATION] In the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR [DATE]142[DATE], we expanded eligibility for the [ORGANIZATION] under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236 to include certain capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines when used in the home for a single patient. To establish the basis of payment for the [ORGANIZATION] for these items, we finalized the additional steps that the [PERSON] Administrative Contractors [PERSON]4s must follow to calculate a pre-adjusted per treatment amount, using the prices they establish under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236e for a capital-related asset that is a home dialysis machine, as well as the methodology that [PERSON] uses to calculate the average per treatment offset amount for home dialysis machines that is used in the [PERSON]4s calculation, to account for the cost of the home dialysis machine that is already in the [ORGANIZATION] base rate. For purposes of this final rule, we will refer to this as the [ORGANIZATION] offset amount. The methodology for calculating the [ORGANIZATION] offset amount is set forth in [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION]tion [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE]v states that effective [PERSON]95anuary 1, [DATE]1, [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]1ly updates the amount determined in [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE]iv by the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] bundled market basket percentage increase factor minus the productivity adjustment factor. The [ORGANIZATION] for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines is based on 65 percent of the [PERSON]4-determined pre-adjusted per treatment amount, reduced by the [ORGANIZATION] offset amount, and is paid for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]15. As we discussed in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 363[DATE], the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] offset amount for capital-related equipment that are home dialysis machines used in the home is 9.32 We stated that the proposed [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] bundled market basket increase factor minus the productivity adjustment is 1.0 percent 1.6 percent minus 0.6 percent. Applying the proposed update factor of 1.010 to the proposed [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] offset amount resulted in a proposed [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] offset amount of 9.41 9.32 x 1.010. We proposed to update this calculation using the most recent data available in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule. The comments and our responses to the comments on the proposed update to the [ORGANIZATION] offset amount are set forth below. Comment One large dialysis organization commented in support of the current [ORGANIZATION] policy, but recommended that [PERSON] recalculate the [ORGANIZATION] offset amount using a [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]16 depreciation schedule, which the commenter asserted would more accurately align with real-world home dialysis machine use. This commenter also recommended that [PERSON] revise the [ORGANIZATION] policy to allow for a modification to the [ORGANIZATION] base rate to ensure ongoing access to innovative technologies. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the commenters suggestion for improving[PERSON] 618[DATE]the [ORGANIZATION] policy. As we discussed in the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 [ORGANIZATION] through [DATE]14[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54, section 104.1[DATE] of the Provider Reimbursement Manual discusses that the useful life of a capital-related asset is its expected useful life to the provider, not necessarily the inherent useful or physical life. Further, the manual provides that under the [PERSON] program, only the [PERSON]5 [PERSON]6 guidelines may be used in selecting a proper useful life for computing depreciation. In keeping with the [PERSON] policy, we established reliance on the [PERSON]6 guidelines to determine the useful life of a capital-related asset that is a home dialysis machine, which is [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1[DATE] and not [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]18 suggested by the commenter see 42 [ORGANIZATION] [DATE]i. We note that we considered alternatives, but concluded that this approach was simpler and appropriate for encouraging and supporting the uptake of new and innovative renal dialysis equipment and supplies 85 FR [DATE]14[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54. We did not propose changes to the methodology for updating the [ORGANIZATION] offset amount for [ORGANIZATION], and therefore we are not finalizing any changes to that methodology in this final rule. PERSON8wever, we will take these recommendations into consideration to potentially inform future rulemaking. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion We are finalizing our proposal to calculate the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] offset amount using the most recent data available. The [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] offset amount for capital-related equipment that are home dialysis machines used in the home is 9.32 As discussed previously in section II.B.1.a of this final rule, the [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] bundled market basket increase factor minus the productivity adjustment is 1.9 percent 2.4 percent minus 0.5 percent. Applying the productivity adjustment factor of 1.019 to the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] offset amount results in a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] offset amount of 9.50 9.32 x [DATE]. [PERSON][DATE] and [ORGANIZATION] Public Comments and [ORGANIZATION] We also received several public comments on topics related to the [ORGANIZATION] and the [PERSON][DATE] policies under the [ORGANIZATION], including from individuals, such as [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] beneficiaries, individual health care providers, manufacturers, [ORGANIZATION] groups, patient advocacy organizations, hospital associations, dialysis associations, as well as various dialysis, kidney, and professional organizations. While these comments related to issues that we either did not discuss in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule or that we discussed for background or context, but for which we did not propose changes, a summary of the significant comments and our responses are set forth below. Comment Commenters overwhelmingly wrote in support of innovation in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] management generally and some specifically mentioned existing or upcoming technologies they thought would benefit [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients. Other commenters expressed interest in seeing improvements in peritoneal dialysis, including on-line generation of dialysate and prevention of infections. Commenters also expressed support for home hemodialysis, citing its flexibility, convenience, and the comfort it provides patients. Commenters expressed interest in seeing improvements in home hemodialysis such as lower costs, more availability, better cannulation, reduced burden on patients and caregivers, and more convenient generation of dialysate. Commenters also stated they would like to see improvements in home dialysis that would increase retention, improve quality of delivered dialysate, or reduce complications. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the supportive comments regarding innovation in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] therapy. PERSON45ke the commenters, [PERSON] supports innovation in the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] space and we look forward to seeing new technologies that improve care for beneficiaries with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. Comments Commenters provided input on the substantial clinical improvement criteria for the [ORGANIZATION] under [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1, offering specific recommendations on what [PERSON] should consider in making a determination of substantial clinical improvement for the TPNIEGPE13 Commenters suggested that certain innovations could be considered evidence of substantial clinical improvement over existing technologies, such as Technical specifications that make home dialysis easier for disadvantaged persons, real time dialysis fluid preparation, and real-time monitoring of patients treatment sessions. Many commenters encouraged [PERSON] to utilize evidence outside of randomized controlled trials RCTs as a [STREET] of demonstrating significant clinical improvement due to the challenges of running clinical trials involving patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], including difficulty in patient recruitment and financial barriers for innovators to conduct these types of large-scale, long-term trials. One commenter who agreed with this stated that [PERSON] also should not only rely on short, small-scale studies conducted by device manufacturers as the standard for substantial clinical improvement. A home dialysis advocacy organization commented that evidence from a clinical trial, abstracts of data, and expert opinion, such as letters from medical professionals, are sufficient to support a showing of substantial clinical improvement, rather than RCTs. That same commenter added that given the challenges specific to conducting studies in the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] space, real-world evidence gathered from studies conducted outside the [PERSON] may be extrapolated to [PERSON] beneficiaries when appropriate. One commenter, a beneficiary, emphasized that patients may have a drastically different perspective of substantial clinical improvement compared to [PERSON]. That commenter stated that greater flexibility is of the utmost importance to home dialysis patients and, therefore, therapies that allow patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] to resume their normal [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19-to-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19 activities should be considered to show substantial clinical improvement. Other commenters also encouraged the use of patient preferences, patient-reported outcomes, and other patient-centered data when evaluating substantial clinical improvement. A commenter encouraged [PERSON] to weigh the reduction of patient and care partner burden, improved communication with the care team, and improved safety through the reduction of severe adverse events in the evaluation of evidence. Other commenters offered suggestions for [PERSON]s current process of evaluating evidence of substantial clinical improvement. Commenters asked that [PERSON] provide guidance on evidence of substantial clinical improvement specific to the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] space, such as the development of a set of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patient-reported outcomes for assessing substantial clinical improvement criteria. Other commenters also suggested using a panel of patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] to assist with tasks such as developing the set of patient-reported outcomes or providing insight for these outcomes during the evaluation process. Some commenters asked [PERSON] to clarify how data and real-world evidence submitted as part of a [ORGANIZATION] application is reviewed and weighed during the review process. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the comments regarding the [PERSON] evaluation process for the substantial clinical improvement criterion for the TPNIEGPE13 In response to commenters suggestions regarding the use of expert opinions, clinical trials, abstracts of data, unpublished sources, and letters from health care providers in our analysis, we note that under [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON], [PERSON] may consider all of these types of data,[ORGANIZATION] others, in making a determination of substantial clinical improvement. A list of information sources that we may consider in our determination is set forth in [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1iii. Additionally, under [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE], [PERSON] may consider other appropriate information sources not otherwise listed in our regulations on substantial clinical improvement. Further, we are taking the opportunity to clarify that RCTs, while potentially informative, are not required under existing regulations to demonstrate substantial clinical improvement for purpose of the TPNIEGPE13 While we did not propose changes to the substantial clinical improvement criteria for the [ORGANIZATION] in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, we will consider these comments for future rulemaking. We encourage [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients and patient advocacy organizations to submit comments on our [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION] proposed rules to provide their perspectives on [ORGANIZATION] applications. Comment Several commenters suggested changes to the [ORGANIZATION] policy under the [ORGANIZATION]. Commenters suggested using [PERSON] determinations for example, [PERSON] Device designations in evaluating [ORGANIZATION] applications. Commenters also asked for [PERSON] to provide increased feedback to applicants throughout the [ORGANIZATION] application process, including providing [ORGANIZATION] feedback on data needed to support a [ORGANIZATION] application as the manufacturers are working towards [PERSON] marketing authorization, public review of the complete application prior to finalizing [ORGANIZATION] application decisions, and an appeal process for manufacturers whose [ORGANIZATION] applications were not approved. In addition, commenters recommended that [PERSON] remove [PERSON]4s discretion in determining pricing of new and innovative renal dialysis equipment and supplies, as provided under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236e, and requested that [PERSON] set more defined payment parameters and public transparency around pricing. Other commenters suggested expanding the [ORGANIZATION] policy to allow [ORGANIZATION] payments to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities with home dialysis devices on operating leases and to expand the [ORGANIZATION] eligibility to include all capital-related assets, not just home dialysis machines, as allowed under [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]6. We also received comments requesting various extensions to the [ORGANIZATION] application deadlines and payment periods such as Extending the duration of the [ORGANIZATION] payment to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]20, extending application timetables for device manufacturers applying for the [ORGANIZATION] in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]21 of the policy, and extending application timetables for manufacturers impacted by [PERSON]0. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the public for their comments. Because we did not propose any changes to the [ORGANIZATION] policy in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, we are not making any changes to that policy in this final rule however, we will consider the commenters recommendations for future rulemaking. Comment Several commenters also suggested changes to the [PERSON][DATE] policy under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.234 For example, one commenter stated that [PERSON] should consider implementing the substantial clinical improvement criteria used to evaluate the [ORGANIZATION] applications for the [PERSON][DATE] applications, and another commenter stated that [PERSON] should not apply the [PERSON][DATE] to biosimilar drugs. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the public for their comments. Because we did not propose any changes to the [PERSON][DATE] policy in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, we are not making any changes to that policy in this final rule however, we will consider the commenters recommendations for future rulemaking.[PERSON] for New and [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] Payment1. [LOCATION] In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 84 FR [ZIP] through [ZIP], [PERSON] established the transitional add-on payment adjustment for new and innovative equipment and supplies [ORGANIZATION] under the [ORGANIZATION], under the authority of section 1881b14Div of the [ORGANIZATION], in order to support [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility use and beneficiary access to these new technologies. We established this add-on payment adjustment to help address the unique circumstances experienced by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities when incorporating new and innovative equipment and supplies into their businesses and to support [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities transitioning or testing these products during the period when they are new to market. We added [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236 to establish the eligibility criteria and payment policies for the TPNIEGPE13 In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 84 FR [ZIP], we established in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] that for dates of service occurring on or after [PERSON]95anuary 1, [ORGANIZATION], we will provide the [ORGANIZATION] to an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility for furnishing a covered equipment or supply only if the item 1 Has been designated by [PERSON] as a renal dialysis service under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.1[DATE]1 2 is new, meaning granted marketing authorization by [PERSON]8 [PERSON] on or after [PERSON]95anuary 1, [ORGANIZATION] 3 is commercially available by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]23, meaning [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]24 in which the payment adjustment would take effect 4 has a [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]8 Common Procedure Coding System ORG5[DATE] application submitted in accordance with the official [ORGANIZATION]evel II ORG5[DATE] coding procedures by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]25 is innovative, meaning it meets the substantial clinical improvement criteria specified in [ORGANIZATION] I[ORGANIZATION] regulations at [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1 and related guidance, and 6 is not a capital related asset that an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility has an economic interest in through ownership regardless of the manner in which it was acquired. Regarding the innovation requirement in [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON], in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 84 FR [ZIP], we stated that we will use the following criteria to evaluate substantial clinical improvement for purposes of the [ORGANIZATION] under the [ORGANIZATION] based on the I[ORGANIZATION] substantial clinical improvement criteria in [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1 and related guidance A new technology represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of [PERSON] beneficiaries. First, [PERSON] considers the totality of the circumstances when making a determination that a new renal dialysis equipment or supply represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of [PERSON] beneficiaries. [ORGANIZATION]ond, a determination that a new renal dialysis equipment or supply represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of [PERSON] beneficiaries means one of the following The new renal dialysis equipment or supply offers a treatment option for a patient population unresponsive to, or ineligible for, currently available treatments or The new renal dialysis equipment or supply offers the ability to diagnose a medical condition in a patient population where that medical condition is currently undetectable, or offers the ability to diagnose a medical condition earlier in a patient population than allowed by currently available methods, and there must also be evidence that use of the new renal[PERSON] 61888dialysis service to make a diagnosis affects the management of the patient or The use of the new renal dialysis equipment or supply significantly improves clinical outcomes relative to renal dialysis services previously available as demonstrated by one or more of the following A reduction in at least one clinically significant adverse event, including a reduction in mortality or a clinically significant complication a decreased rate of at least one subsequent diagnostic or therapeutic intervention a decreased number of future hospitalizations or physician visits a more rapid beneficial resolution of the disease process treatment including, but not limited to, a reduced length of stay or recovery time an improvement in one or more activities of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 living an improved quality of life or, a demonstrated greater medication adherence or compliance or, The totality of the circumstances otherwise demonstrates that the new renal dialysis equipment or supply substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of [PERSON] beneficiaries. Third, evidence from the following published or unpublished information sources from within the [PERSON] or elsewhere may be sufficient to establish that a new renal dialysis equipment or supply represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of [PERSON] beneficiaries Clinical trials, peer reviewed journal articles study results meta-analyses consensus statements white papers patient surveys case studies reports systematic literature reviews letters from major [ORGANIZATION] associations editorials and letters to the editor and public comments. Other appropriate information sources may be considered. Fourth, the medical condition diagnosed or treated by the new renal dialysis equipment or supply may have a low prevalence among [PERSON] beneficiaries. Fifth, the new renal dialysis equipment or supply may represent an advance that substantially improves, relative to services or technologies previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of a subpopulation of patients with the medical condition diagnosed or treated by the new renal dialysis equipment or supply. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 84 FR [ZIP] through [ZIP], we also established a process modeled after I[ORGANIZATION]s process of determining if a new medical service or technology meets the substantial clinical improvement criteria specified in [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1. Specifically, similar to the I[ORGANIZATION] New Technology Add-On Payment, we wanted to align our goals with the [PERSON]9 efforts to transform the [ORGANIZATION] delivery system for the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] beneficiary through competition and innovation to provide patients with better value and results. As we discussed in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 84 FR [ZIP], we believe it is appropriate to facilitate access to new and innovative equipment and supplies through add-on payments similar to the I[ORGANIZATION] New Technology Add-On Payment and to provide stakeholders with standard criteria for both inpatient and outpatient settings. In [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236c, we established a process for our announcement of [ORGANIZATION] determinations and a deadline for consideration of new renal dialysis equipment or supply applications under the [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] will consider whether a new renal dialysis equipment or supply meets the eligibility criteria specified in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] and summarize the applications received in the [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION] proposed rules. Then, after consideration of public comments, we will announce the results in [ORGANIZATION] as part of our [ORGANIZATION]1 updates and changes to the [ORGANIZATION] in the [ORGANIZATION] final rule. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we also specified certain deadlines for the application requirements. We noted that we would only consider a complete application received by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2[DATE] prior to the particular [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28. In addition, we required that [PERSON] marketing authorization for the equipment or supply must occur by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]29 prior to the particular [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28. We also stated in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 84 FR [ZIP] through [ZIP] that we would establish a workgroup of [PERSON] medical and other staff to review the materials submitted as part of the [ORGANIZATION] application, public comments, [PERSON] marketing authorization, and ORG5[DATE] application information and assess the extent to which the product provides substantial clinical improvement over current technologies. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we established [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236d to provide a payment adjustment for a new and innovative renal dialysis equipment or supply. We stated that the [ORGANIZATION] is paid for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]15. Following payment of the [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] base rate will not be modified and the new and innovative renal dialysis equipment or supply will become an eligible outlier service as provided in [ORGANIZATION]. 413.23[DATE] Regarding the basis of payment for the [ORGANIZATION], in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we finalized at [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236e that the [ORGANIZATION] is based on 65 percent of the price established by the [PERSON]4s, using the information from the invoice and other specified sources of information. In the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR [DATE]1410 through [DATE], we made several changes to the [ORGANIZATION] eligibility criteria at [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236 First, we revised the definition of new at [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]2 as within [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]20 beginning on the date of the [PERSON] marketing authorization. [ORGANIZATION]ond, we changed the deadline for [ORGANIZATION] applicants ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II code application submission from [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]29 of the particular [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28 to the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II code application deadline for bi[ORGANIZATION]1 Coding Cycle 2 for durable medical equipment, orthotics, prosthetics, and supplies DMEPOS items and services as specified in the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II coding guidance on the [PERSON] website prior to the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28. In addition, a copy of the applicable [PERSON] marketing authorization must be submitted to [PERSON] by the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II code application deadline for bi[ORGANIZATION]1 Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services as specified in the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II coding guidance on the [PERSON] website in order for the equipment or supply to be eligible for the [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]34. Third, we revised [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] to remove a reference to related guidance on the substantial clinical improvement criterion, as the guidance had already been codified. Finally, in the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we expanded the [ORGANIZATION] policy to include certain capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines when used in the home for a single patient. We explained that capital-related assets are defined in the Provider Reimbursement Manual chapter 1, section 104.1 as assets that a provider has an economic interest in through ownership regardless of the manner in which they were acquired. We noted that examples of capital-related assets for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities are dialysis machines and water purification systems. We explained that, although we stated in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule 84 FR [ZIP] that we did not believe capital-related assets should be eligible for additional payment through the [ORGANIZATION] because the cost of these items is captured in cost reports, they depreciate over time, and are generally used for multiple patients, there were a number of other factors we considered that led us to consider expanding eligibility for these technologies in the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION][PERSON] [DATE]. We explained that, following publication of the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we continued to study the issue of payment for capital-related assets under the [ORGANIZATION], taking into account information from a wide variety of stakeholders and recent developments and initiatives regarding kidney care. For example, we considered various [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 home dialysis initiatives, Executive Orders to transform kidney care, and how the risk of [ORGANIZATION] for particularly vulnerable [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] beneficiaries could be mitigated by encouraging home dialysis. After closely considering these issues, we proposed a revision to [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]6 in the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule to provide an exception to the general exclusion for capital-related assets from eligibility for the [ORGANIZATION] for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines when used in the home for a single patient and that meet the other eligibility criteria in [ORGANIZATION]. 413.235b, and finalized the exception as proposed in the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule. We finalized the same determination process for [ORGANIZATION] applications for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines as for all other [ORGANIZATION] applications that we will consider whether the new home dialysis machine meets the eligibility criteria specified in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] and announce the results in [ORGANIZATION] as part of our [ORGANIZATION]1 updates and changes to the [ORGANIZATION]. Per [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236c, we will only consider, for additional payment using the [ORGANIZATION] for a particular [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28, an application for a capital-related asset that is a home dialysis machine received by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2[DATE] prior to the particular [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28. If the application is not received by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2[DATE], the application will be denied and the applicant is able to reapply within [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]20 beginning on the date of [PERSON] marketing authorization in order to be considered for the [ORGANIZATION], in accordance with [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]2. In the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule, at [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE], we finalized a pricing methodology for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines when used in the home for a single patient, which requires the [PERSON]4s to calculate the [ORGANIZATION]1 allowance and the preadjusted per treatment amount. The pre-adjusted per treatment amount is reduced by an estimated average per treatment offset amount to account for the costs already paid through the [ORGANIZATION] base rate. The [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] offset amount was 9.32 We finalized that this amount will be updated on an [ORGANIZATION]1 basis so that it is consistent with how the [ORGANIZATION] base rate is updated. We revised [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236d to reflect that we would pay 65 percent of the pre-adjusted per treatment amount minus the offset for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines when used in the home for a single patient. We revised [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE] to reflect that following payment of the [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] base rate will not be modified and the new and innovative renal dialysis equipment or supply will be an eligible outlier service as provided in [ORGANIZATION]. 413.23[DATE], except a capital-related asset that is a home dialysis machine will not be an eligible outlier service as provided in [ORGANIZATION]. 413.23[DATE] In summary, under the current eligibility requirements in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] provides for a [ORGANIZATION] to an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility for furnishing a covered equipment or supply only if the item 1 Has been designated by [PERSON] as a renal dialysis service under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.1[DATE]1 2 Is new, meaning within [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]20 beginning on the date of the [PERSON] marketing authorization 3 Is commercially available by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]23, meaning [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]24 in which the payment adjustment would take effect 4 Has a complete ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II code application submitted in accordance with the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II coding procedures on the [PERSON] website, by the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II code application deadline for bi[ORGANIZATION]1 Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services as specified in the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II coding guidance on the [PERSON] website prior to the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28 5 Is innovative, meaning it meets the criteria specified in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1 and 6 Is not a capital-related asset, except for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines. We received two applications for the [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION]. One applicant, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 the applicant for the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 Peritoneal Dialysis Drain Set Monitoring System, withdrew its application from consideration after the issuance of the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule because it did not receive [PERSON] marketing authorization by [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]8, which was the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II code application deadline for bi[ORGANIZATION]1 Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services. Under [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236c, an applicant for the [ORGANIZATION] must receive [PERSON] marketing authorization for its new equipment or supply by the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II Code application deadline for bi[ORGANIZATION]1 Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services as specified in the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II coding guidance on the [PERSON] website prior to the particular [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28. Therefore, the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 Peritoneal Dialysis Drain Set Monitoring System is not eligible for consideration for the [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION]. We are not including in this final rule the description and discussion of this application, which was included in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule. We note that we received public comments on the application that was withdrawn. PERSON8wever, because the application was withdrawn and thus the technology is ineligible for the [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], we are not summarizing nor responding to public comments regarding the [ORGANIZATION] criteria for this technology in this final rule. A discussion of the remaining application, which met this deadline, is presented in this final rule. The application discussed in this final rule is for a technology commonly used for the treatment of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] H[LOCATION]18 A detailed definition for HD is included in Chapter 11, [ORGANIZATION]tion 10 of the [PERSON] Benefits Policy [PERSON]. GPE25 100-02.2 In brief, HD is a process that involves blood passing through an artificial kidney machine and the waste products diffusing across a manmade membrane into a bath solution known as dialysate after which the cleansed blood is returned to the patients body. HD is accomplished usually in [TIME] sessions, 3 times [DATE].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2 [PERSON] Benefits Policy [PERSON]. GPE25 100-[ORGANIZATION], available at [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 submitted an application for the [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION]. According to the applicant, the technology is an HD machine that has been designed for patient-driven self-care and to minimize system training time. The applicant stated that the system is intended to substantially improve the treatment of people with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] by removing barriers to home dialysis. The applicant explained that [ORGANIZATION] is comprised of 1 the ORG61supreg Console with integrated water purification, on-demand dialysate production, and a touchscreen interface 2 a proprietary, disposable, single-use pre-strung cartridge and 3 [ORGANIZATION]. Per the applicant, the system is built to function in a connected setting with cloud-based system monitoring, patient analytics and clinical recordkeeping. The applicant stated that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 features combine to provide a significantly differentiated HD solution with many benefits. First, the applicant stated that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 touchscreen interface made it easy to learn and use, guiding users through treatment using step-by-step[PERSON] 61890instructions with simple words and animation. The applicant also stated that instructions include non-technical language and color-coded parts to enable easier training, faster set-up, and simpler management including clear alarm explanations and resolution instructions. [ORGANIZATION]ond, the applicant stated that [ORGANIZATION] can accommodate treatments at home, allowing for flexibility in treatment frequencies, durations, and flow rates. Per the applicant, [ORGANIZATION] did not have a pre-configured dialyzer, which allows clinicians to use a broad range of dialyzer types and manufactures, allowing for greater customization of treatment for the patient. The applicant stated that this was an improvement over the incumbent home device, which requires a separate device component and complex process to switch to another dialyzer. Third, the applicant stated that [ORGANIZATION] is an all-in-one system with integrated water purification and on-demand dialysate production, eliminating the need for industrial water treatment rooms that are required to operate traditional HD machines. The applicant also stated that electronic data capture and automatic wireless transmission eliminate the need for manual record keeping by the patient, care partner, or nurse. Per the applicant, a single-use ORG61supreg [PERSON] with pre-strung blood, saline, and infusion tubing and a series of sensor-receptors mounted to an organizer snaps into the system, minimizing difficult connections that require additional training. The applicant stated that automated features, including an integrated blood pressure monitor, air removal, priming, and blood return, minimize user errors, save time, and streamline the user experience. Fourth, the applicant stated that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 two-[STREET] wireless connectivity and data analytics provide the ability to continuously activate new capabilities and enhancements through wireless software updates, while also enabling predictive preventative maintenance to maximize machine uptime. The applicant stated that currently 88 percent of patients receive HD in a clinic 3 times [DATE], for [TIME] a [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19 and fewer than 2 percent perform HD treatment at home.3 The applicant stated that 25 to 36 percent of home HD patients return to in-center care within [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]38 of initiating HD at home.4 5 Per the applicant, barriers to home dialysis adoption and retention have been well studied and include treatment burden for patients and care partner fatigue technical challenges with operating a HD machine space, home modifications, and supplies management patients not wanting medical equipment in the home and safety concerns.6 [DATE]--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]4.

[ORGANIZATION] in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. Health services research, 535, [DATE]. The applicant stated that while peritoneal dialysis [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], like HD, removes excess fluid and waste from the body, it has a different mechanism of action and relies on the bodys own membrane, the peritoneum, to act as the dialyzer. Per the applicant, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] requires surgical placement of a catheter in the abdomen and utilizes a cleansing fluid, dialysate, that must be infused and dwell in the abdomen to remove waste products from the blood. The applicant stated that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] must be conducted [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 to achieve adequate dialysis and can be conducted manually or via a cycler while in contrast, HD directly cleanses the blood with the use of a HD machine, dialysate and a dialyzer, which acts as an artificial kidney in removing excess fluid and toxins. The applicant stated that HD also requires surgical placement of a dialysis access, which is usually in the form of a catheter or a more permanent arteriovenous fistula.9--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9 Blake, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] , [PERSON]4, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] , amp [PERSON]5, M.[PERSON]95 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]40. Peritoneal dialysis and the process of modality selection. Peritoneal dialysis international ORG51, 333, 233-241. The applicant asserted that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] is the dominant home therapy used around the world, but should not be solely relied upon to increase growth in home dialysis, as there are physiological contraindications.10 The applicant also stated that there is recent evidence that post 90-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19 mortality is higher in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients than in HD patients. Per the applicant, multivariable risk-adjusted analyses demonstrated that the mortality hazard ratio of HD versus [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] is 0.[DATE]4 95 percent confidence interval [ORGANIZATION], 0.68-0.80 in the 2[DATE]0 to 360-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19 period after starting [DATE] The applicant stated that patients and clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of both options and select the one that meets the individual patients preferences, goals, values and physiology. Per the applicant, because [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] relies on the patients own membrane, physiologic changes can occur and result in patients who are unable to continue [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] due to loss of the ability to achieve adequacy. The applicant stated that these home patients could consider home HD rather than a return to in-center and noted that the practice of transitioning from one home modality to another is acknowledged by experts to be underutilized and is particularly pronounced in the [PERSON] , where the ratio of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] use to home HD is 61,12 as compared to 41 in Canada.13--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10 Ibid. 11 [PERSON]6, P., [PERSON][DATE], [PERSON]8 , [PERSON]9, [LOCATION]18E , [LOCATION]0, [LOCATION]1, PERSON[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54, [LOCATION]1, [LOCATION]3, [LOCATION]B , . . . amp [LOCATION]4, R.

Per the applicant, ORG[DATE]9 is the only other mobile HD machine that is approved for home use.1 Renal Dialysis Service Criterion [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]1 With respect to the first [ORGANIZATION] eligibility criterion under [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]1, whether the item has been designated by [PERSON] as a renal dialysis service under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.1[DATE]1, maintenance dialysis treatments and all associated services, including historically defined dialysis-related drugs, laboratory tests, equipment, supplies, and staff time, were included in the composite rate for renal dialysis services as of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]45 [DATE]5 FR [ZIP]. An in-home HD machine would be considered equipment essential for the provision of maintenance dialysis. We received no public comments on whether [ORGANIZATION] meets this criterion. Based on its status as an in-home HD machine, we consider [ORGANIZATION] to be a renal dialysis service under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.1[DATE]1 2 Newness Criterion [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]2 With respect to the second [ORGANIZATION] eligibility criterion under [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]2, whether the item is new, meaning within [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]20 beginning on the date of the [PERSON] marketing authorization, the applicant indicated that [ORGANIZATION] received [PERSON] marketing authorization for home use on [DATE] [DATE], [ORGANIZATION].14 We received no public comments on whether [ORGANIZATION] meets the newness criterion. Based on the information provided by the applicant, we agree that [ORGANIZATION] meets the newness criterion.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14 As we stated in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], in reviewing the enclosure to which the [DATE] [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] authorization letter refers, the applicants [ORGANIZATION]tion 510k submission indicated that the ORG61supreg [PERSON] was reviewed separately from [ORGANIZATION] and has its own separate 510k clearance. We further stated that, in the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule, [PERSON] determined that the cartridge did not meet the newness criterion for the [ORGANIZATION] 85 FR [DATE] and as such, the cartridge was not new.---------------------------------------------------------------------------3 Commercial Availability Criterion [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE] With respect to the third eligibility criterion under [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE], whether the item is commercially available by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]23, meaning [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]24 in which the payment adjustment would take effect, applicant indicated that [ORGANIZATION] became available for home use on [DATE]84 1, [ORGANIZATION]. We received no public comments on whether [ORGANIZATION] meets the commercial availability criterion. Based on the information provided by the applicant, we agree that [ORGANIZATION] meets the commercial availability criterion.4 ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II Application Criterion [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]4 The fourth [ORGANIZATION] eligibility criterion, under [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]4, is whether the applicant has submitted a complete ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II code application in accordance with the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II coding procedures on the [PERSON] website, by the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II code application deadline for bi[ORGANIZATION]1 Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services as specified in the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II coding guidance on the [PERSON] website prior to the particular [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28. The applicant indicated that it submitted a ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II code application on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]8, which was same [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19 as the deadline specified ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II code application deadline for bi[ORGANIZATION]1 Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services specified in [PERSON] guidance.15 We received no public comments on whether [ORGANIZATION] meets this criterion. Based on the information provided by the applicant, we agree the applicant has met the ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]evel II application criterion.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15 Innovation Criterion [ORGANIZATION].

[PERSON] to our review of the application and a summary of our preliminary concerns.[PERSON] 61892We stated that we did not include detailed summaries of the remaining supplemental content included with the application. Specifically, the applicant submitted numerous supplemental background materials related to the dialysis industry, reimbursement patterns, modalities, treatment frequencies, patient adherence, hospitalization rates, and quality of life. The applicant also submitted several letters of support for [ORGANIZATION] three from dialysis patients, three from nephrologists, and one from a dialysis clinic nurse. These letters emphasized benefits of [ORGANIZATION], including reduced frequency of dialysis treatment, improved home dialysis retention, reduced patient and caregiver burden, reduced patient fatigue, and improved patient quality of life.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2[DATE] [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] Applicant Substantial Clinical Improvement Sources As we discussed in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], the applicants primary support for its three substantial clinical improvement claims came from a prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized crossover study that compared in-center and in-home HD performance using [ORGANIZATION]. Per the applicant, this study is referred to as [ORGANIZATION] Investigational Device Exemption [ORGANIZATION] Study and the original study protocol and amendments were approved by [PERSON] and registered on as ID NCT02460263. The applicant stated that of the 30 participants enrolled 1[DATE] White and 13 [LOCATION] or African American, [DATE] men and 10 women completed the study. Thirteen of the participants had previous home HD experience with ORG[DATE]9, and the remainder had previously received conventional in-center HD care. The applicant also noted that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study sample was comprised of a representative cohort of dialysis patients and reported that it was similar to the population studied for the [ORGANIZATION] study for the incumbent ORG[DATE]9. As described in the study protocol, the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were a standardized [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] [PERSON]56tV of greater than or equal to 2.1 and ultrafiltration fluid removal value as reported by the device within ten percent of the expected fluid removal based on the ultrafiltration prescription and [ORGANIZATION] Console fluid removal algorithm, respectively.28 We clarified in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule that [PERSON]56tV is a value used to quantify dialysis treatment adequacy and [PERSON]56  dialyzer clearance, t  time, and V  Volume of distribution of urea. The applicant stated that each study participant served as his or her own control and remained in the trial for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]58, during which time they were prescribed HD with [ORGANIZATION] on a 4 times [DATE] schedule. The applicant explained that the trial consisted of 4 treatment periods 1 A [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]59, in-center run-in period 2 an in-center period of 32 treatments [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]60 during which [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility staff managed the dialysis treatments 3 a transition period of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]61 to train the patient and care partner in managing the dialysis and 4 a final in-home period of 32 treatments [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]60.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28 ORG58 website. [ORGANIZATION]ast Updated [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]. With respect to the applicants secondary sources of support, a poster presentation from [LOCATION]5, [ORGANIZATION], presented dialysis adequacy data collected from a retrospective review of 29 patients 18 males, 11 females and 1[DATE] percent [LOCATION], 10 percent Hispanic dialysis records. The study compared [PERSON]56tV results of patients aged [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]63 receiving dialysis using [ORGANIZATION] to patients receiving dialysis from a conventional HD machine. The majority of patients used a fistula or graft 59 percent fistula, 28 percent graft, 10 percent catheter. One hundred ninety two dialysis treatments were conducted on a thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] schedule using [ORGANIZATION] with a dialysate flow rate of 300 m[ORGANIZATION] per minute. A single pool [PERSON]56tV of greater than 1.2 was achieved in 94 percent of treatments in patients less than 90 kg with an average duration of treatment at [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]544 -29 minutes and in [DATE]9 percent of treatments in patients greater than 90 kg with an average duration of treatment at [TIME]. The average achieved [PERSON]56tV was 1.4 -0.2 among treatments provided with [ORGANIZATION]. Eighty-eight treatments were conducted using a conventional HD machine with a dialysate flow rate of 500 m[ORGANIZATION] per minute. A single pool [PERSON]56tV of greater than 1.2 was achieved in 93 percent of treatments in patients less than 90 kg with an average duration of treatment at [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54[DATE] -21 minutes and in 83 percent of treatments in patients greater than 90 kg with an average duration of treatment at [TIME]. The average achieved [PERSON]56tV was 1.6 -0.4 among the conventional HD treatments.29--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29 [LOCATION]5, PERSON38 [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]s Dialyzed Thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] Using a Dialysate Flow of 300 m[ORGANIZATION]min, clinical abstract, presented [DATE] [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]0 Dialysis Conference, GPE14, GPE15.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next, an article from [PERSON]3, [ORGANIZATION], described additional data from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study discussed previously, including health-related quality of life, to further assess the safety of home HD with [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] information identified the mean age as 49.8  1[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]20, 62 percent male, 62 percent White, 38 percent [LOCATION] or African American, 23 percent Hispanic or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], 68 percent Not Hispanic or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], and 8 percent not reported, among patients established on home H[LOCATION]18 Among the patients new to home HD, the mean age was identified as [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]65, 65 percent male, 53 percent White, 4[DATE] percent [LOCATION] or African American, 29 percent Hispanic or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], [DATE]1 percent Not Hispanic or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], and 0 percent not reported. Twenty-eight of 30 patients 93 percent completed all trial periods. Adherence to the prescribed 4 treatments [DATE] schedule was 96 percent in-center and 99 percent in-home. The median time to recovery was [TIME] during the in-center and [TIME] during the at-home phase of the trial. Median index values on the 5-level Euro[PERSON]58ol-5 Dimension E[PERSON]58-5D-5[ORGANIZATION] a self-assessed, health related, quality of life questionnaire were similar during the in-center as compared to in-home dialysis at 0.832 and 0.826, respectively. [PERSON]s new to home HD had lower median values 0.[DATE]51 for both in-center and in-home periods. [PERSON]s who had used home dialysis prior to the trial had higher median values during both in-center 0.903 and in-home 0.906 periods. [PERSON]s reported feeling alert or well-rested with little difficulty falling or staying asleep or feeling tired and worn out when using [ORGANIZATION] in either environment. The authors concluded that when using [ORGANIZATION] in-home, patients reported similar time to recovery, general health status, and sleep quality compared to using [ORGANIZATION] in-center.30--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30 [PERSON]3, ORG63 , [LOCATION]5, GPE25, [LOCATION]6, GPE16[PERSON]95 , [LOCATION][DATE], [PERSON] , amp [PERSON], M.

[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE], 244, 480-4[DATE].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next, an article from PERSON4[DATE], [ORGANIZATION], described the use of uremic solute kinetic models to assess dialysis adequacy via theoretical single pool [PERSON]56tV levels when varying the dialysis blood flow rates and the patient urea volume of distribution. A comparison was made between dialysate flows of 300 and 500 m[ORGANIZATION]min at blood flows of both 300 and 400 m[ORGANIZATION]min. The patient urea volume of[PERSON] 61893distribution range modeled by the authors ranged from 25 to 45 GPE25 Under ideal conditions, the authors demonstrated that with a blood flow of 300 m[ORGANIZATION] per minute, a single pool [PERSON]56tV of greater than 1.2 could be achieved in patients with a urea volume of distribution of 35 [ORGANIZATION] and [TIME] of dialysis. [PERSON]s with a urea volume of distribution of 40 [ORGANIZATION] would require [TIME] of dialysis. [PERSON]s with a urea volume of distribution of 45 [ORGANIZATION] would require over [TIME] of dialysis. With a blood flow of 400 m[ORGANIZATION] per minute, patients with a urea volume of distribution of 40 [ORGANIZATION] could achieve the target single pool [PERSON]56tV of greater than 1.2 with [TIME] of dialysis. [PERSON]s with a volume of distribution of 45 [ORGANIZATION] could achieve the target with [TIME] of dialysis. The authors did not model urea kinetics for patients with volumes of distribution greater than 45 GPE25[DATE]--------------------------------------------------------------------------- [DATE] PERSON4[DATE], [PERSON]2[PERSON]56 , [LOCATION][DATE], GPE13, [PERSON]3, ORG63 , amp [LOCATION]5, GPE25 [DATE].

[PERSON] information reflected the mean age as [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]66, 19 men and the following racial and ethnic representation 1[DATE] White, 13 [LOCATION] or African American, 8 Hispanic or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], and 21 Not Hispanic or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. Comparisons among the 28 patients in this study and subsequent secondary analyses were either made between [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]6[DATE] of using [ORGANIZATION] for in-center HD and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]6[DATE] of [ORGANIZATION] for in-home HD or between using [ORGANIZATION] in-home HD and the treatment provided prior to study enrollment. In both settings, patients dialyzed using [ORGANIZATION] 4 times [DATE]. The primary efficacy endpoint was achievement of a [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] standard [PERSON]56tV greater than or equal to 2.1 in both the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]68 in-center phase of the study and the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]68 in-home phase of the study. This endpoint was achieved in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]69 in the in-center dialysis period and in 168 of 1[DATE][[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]59s in the in-home dialysis period. The primary safety endpoint of adverse event rates were similar at 1.9 percent in the in-center dialysis period and 1.8 percent in the in-home dialysis period. The secondary efficacy endpoint was whether the ultrafiltration volume and rate achieved the prescribed levels. In both in-center and in-home dialysis, 94 percent of treatments achieved successful delivery of ultrafiltration, defined as a rate within ten percent of the prescribed value. Of 960 in-center dialysis services and 896 in-home dialysis services, 9[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54 and 884 were completed respectively, yielding adherence rates of 96 percent and 99 percent.32--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32 [ORGANIZATION] and efficacy of the ORG61 hemodialysis system for in-center and home hemodialysis [LOCATION]6, GPE16[PERSON]95 , [LOCATION]5, GPE25, ORG65 , PERSON49, [PERSON]2[PERSON]95 , PERSON50, [PERSON]2G , PERSON[DATE], [PERSON]2[ORGANIZATION] , [PERSON], [LOCATION][DATE], [PERSON] , [PERSON]3, ORG63 and [PERSON], M.A [DATE], [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next, a separate article by [LOCATION]6 [ORGANIZATION], reported additional data from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study previously discussed regarding participants assessment of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 ease-of-use, the degree of dependence on health care workers and caregivers after training with the system was complete, and the training time required for a participant to be competent in self-care. [PERSON] information reflected the mean age as [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]1, 18 men, 10 women, 16 White, [DATE] Hispanic or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], 9 Not Hispanic or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], and 12 [LOCATION] or African American. Participants were stratified according to whether they were previously on self-care dialysis at home or conventional in-center H[LOCATION]18 Thirteen participants had previous experience performing self-care H[LOCATION]18 The remaining 15 participants had previous experience with in-center HD only. All participants rated the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 setup, treatment, and takedown on a scale from 1 very difficult to 5 very simple and indicated whether they had required assistance with treatment over the prior [DATE] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s. Set up times were similar regardless of whether the participants were previously on self-care HD or conventional in-center H[LOCATION]18 For the participants previously on in-center HD, the average set up time for the concentrates was [TIME] and for the cartridge, [TIME]. For participants previously on self-care home HD, the average set up time for the concentrates was 1.[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54 minutes and for the cartridge, [TIME]. The average rating of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 ease of use for setup was [DATE], treatment 4.6, and take down 4.6 among the participants previously on self-care home H[LOCATION]18 In comparison, based on recollection not based on rating during time of use these participants average rating of their previous devices ease of use for setup was 3.5, treatment 3.3, and take down 3.8 The average rating of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 ease of use for setup and treatment was 4.6 and 4.[DATE] for take down among participants without prior self-care experience. Among patients surveyed, caregiver assistance was required in 62 percent of patient-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3 during home self-care. Participants previously on self-care home HD required some caregiver assistance in 42 percent of the in-home dialysis treatment [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3. Participants previously on conventional in-center dialysis required some caregiver assistance in 35 percent of the in-home dialysis treatment [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3. The requirement for some form of assistance among participants with or without previous self-care experience was not meaningfully different. Finally, the authors noted that a protocol amendment allowed for the recording of the number of training sessions necessary to deem a patient competent to do self-care dialysis. This recording was limited to the last 15 participants enrolled into the study. Five of these participants had previous self-care dialysis at home experience. The average number of training sessions required to be deemed competent was 3.6 for participants with previous self-care dialysis at home experience and 3.9 sessions for participants with only conventional in-center HD experience.33--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 33 [LOCATION]6, Troy [PERSON]2, PERSON38 [LOCATION]5, PERSON30, [PERSON]95oseph [PERSON]2 PERSON49, PERSON32, PERSON33, PERSON34, [PERSON] GPE13 [LOCATION][DATE], Glenn M.

[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE] [ORGANIZATION].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next, a poster presentation from PERSON39, [ORGANIZATION], reported patient device preference of prior in-home HD patients based on data from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study previously discussed. The authors noted that 13 of the 30 participants in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] trial were performing in-home HD at the time of enrollment and that prior to the study, dialysis prescriptions averaged [DATE] treatments [DATE] with an average time of [TIME] per session. Trial prescriptions were for 4 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s [DATE] and an average of [TIME] per session. Adherence to the study regimen was 9[DATE] percent and 92 percent of surveys were completed. The authors concluded that participants with prior home HD experience preferred [ORGANIZATION] compared to their prior device and 85.6 percent found that [ORGANIZATION] was easier to use.34--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34 PERSON39, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], [LOCATION]6, GPE16, [PERSON] M. [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] Device Preference for PERSON8me [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] A Subset Analysis of the ORG61 PERSON8me [ORGANIZATION] Trial. Poster Presentation at [ORGANIZATION], [DATE] [ORGANIZATION].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- As stated previously in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 3633[DATE], the applicant submitted several sources pertaining to the incumbent, ORG[DATE]9. First, an article from PERSON40 [ORGANIZATION], described a feasibility study to demonstrate the safety of center-based versus home-based [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 HD with the ORG[DATE]9 portable HD device. This retrospective analysis examined the extent to which clinical effects[PERSON] 61894previously associated with short-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 dialysis were also seen using the ORG[DATE]9 device. The authors conducted a prospective, two-treatment, [DATE], open-label, crossover study of in-center HD vs. home HD in 32 patients treated at six [PERSON] centers. [PERSON] information reflected the mean age as 5[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]38s, 63 percent male, 38 percent female, 24 White, 6 [LOCATION] or African American, 1 American Indian or Alaskan native, and 1 Asian. The [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]68 ORG81 Phase 6 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19sweek was followed by a [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]8 transition period and then followed by the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]68 PERSON8me Phase 6 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19sweek. Data was collected retrospectively on HD treatment parameters immediately preceding the study in a subset of patients. Twenty-six out of 32 patients 81 percent successfully completed the study. Treatment compliance defined as completing 43 to 48 treatments in a given phase was comparable between the 2 treatment environments 88 percent ORG81 vs. 89 percent PERSON8me. Successful delivery of at least 90 percent of prescribed fluid volume primary endpoint was achieved in 98.5 percent of treatments in-center and 9[DATE].3 percent at home. Total effluent volume as a percentage of prescribed volume was between 94 percent and 100 percent for all study [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3. The composite rate of intradialytic and interdialytic adverse events per 100 treatments was significantly higher for the ORG81 Phase 5.30 compared with the PERSON8me Phase 2.10 p0.00[DATE]. Compared with the period immediately preceding the study, there were reductions in blood pressure, antihypertensive medications, and interdialytic weight gain. The study concluded that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 home HD with a small, easy-to-use HD device is a viable dialysis option for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients capable of selfpartner administered dialysis.35--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 35 PERSON40, M., [ORGANIZATION], A comparison of center-based vs. home-based [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 hemodialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE], 11 468-4[DATE][DATE], [DATE]9.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- [ORGANIZATION]ond, an article from PERSON41 [ORGANIZATION], reported on interim results of [ORGANIZATION] and Every[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19-Dialysis Outcome Measurements [ORGANIZATION]6 study, a multi-center, prospective, cohort study of at-home short [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 HD with a planned [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]80 follow-up [URL] identifier, NCT0028[DATE]13. Eligible patients were adults with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] requiring dialysis who were being initiated on short [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 HD prescribed 6 times [DATE] at home using the ORG[DATE]9 cycler and who had [PERSON] as their primary insurance payer. The authors examined the long-term effect of short [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 HD on health-related quality of life, as measured by the Short Form-36 [ORGANIZATION] health survey. The survey was administered at baseline, 4 and 12 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 after initiation of short [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 HD to 291 total cohort participants. [PERSON] information reflected the mean age as 5[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]20, 66 percent male and [DATE]0 percent White. Of the 291 participants, 154 completed the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]80 follow-up as-treated cohort. In the total cohort analysis, both the physical- and mental-component summary scores improved over the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]80 period, as did all 8 individual domains of the [ORGANIZATION]. The as-treated cohort analysis showed similar improvements with the exception of the role-emotional domain. Significantly, in the as-treated cohort, the percentage of patients achieving a physical component summary score at least equivalent to the general population more than doubled. The authors concluded by noting that at-home short [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 HD is associated with long-term improvements in various physical and mental health-related quality of life measures.36--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 36 PERSON41, [ORGANIZATION] , [ORGANIZATION] [DATE]8. At-home short [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 hemodialysis improves the long-term health-related quality of life. ORG83, 825, 561-569.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Third, in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], authors described a cohort study in which 4,201 new home HD patients in [DATE]9 were matched with 4,201 new [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]83 from the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]4 [DATE] database to assess relative mortality, hospitalization, and technique failure. [PERSON] information reflected the mean age as [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]84, 6[DATE] percent male, 33 percent female, 24.4 percent [LOCATION], and [DATE]5.6 percent Nonblack. [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]85 home HD patients initiated use of ORG[DATE]9 from [DATE]9 through [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]83. Authors reported home HD was associated with 20 percent lower risk for all-cause mortality, 8 percent lower risk for all-cause hospitalization, and 3[DATE] percent lower risk for technique failure, all relative to P[LOCATION]18 Regarding hospitalization, risk comparisons favored home HD for cardiovascular disease and dialysis access infection and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] for bloodstream infection. Authors noted that matching was unlikely to reduce confounding attributable to unmeasured factors, including residual kidney function lack of data regarding dialysis frequency, duration, and dose in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 home HD patients and frequency and solution in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients and diagnosis codes used to classify admissions. The authors concluded that these data suggest that relative to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 home HD is associated with decreased mortality, hospitalization, and technique failure but that risks for mortality and hospitalization were similar with these modalities in new dialysis patients.3[DATE]--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3[DATE] [LOCATION], [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] , PERSON42, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] , amp PERSON43, [PERSON][PERSON]95 [ORGANIZATION]5.

Among the home [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients, the mean age was identified as [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]8[DATE], 66.9 percent male, [DATE]3.1 percent White, 25.1 percent [LOCATION] and 1.2 percent Other. The composite hospitalization rate was significantly lower with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 home HD than with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] 0.93 vs. 1.35patient-[ORGANIZATION]20. [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]85 home HD patients spent significantly fewer [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s in the hospital than [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients 5.2 vs. 9.2 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19spatient-[ORGANIZATION]20, and significantly more [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 home HD patients remained admission-free [DATE] percent [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 home dialysis vs. 32 percent P[LOCATION]18 In contrast, there was no significant difference in hospitalizations between [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 home HD and conventional HD 0.93 vs. 1.10patient-[ORGANIZATION]20.

Significantly more [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] than [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 home HD patients switched back to in-center HD 44 percent vs. 15 percent. In this prevalent cohort, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 home HD was associated with fewer admissions and hospital [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s than [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], and a substantially lower risk of modality failure.38--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38 PERSON44, [LOCATION]1[DATE] , PERSON45, GPE25, amp PERSON46, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]56.

ORG83, 882, 360-368.---------------------------------------------------------------------------b Applicant Substantial Clinical Improvement Claims Regarding the applicants first claim that [ORGANIZATION] decreases treatment frequency with adequate[PERSON] 61895dialysis clearance, the applicant stated that [ORGANIZATION] is the only mobile HD device approved for use in the home that can achieve adequate dialysis in as little as 3 treatments [DATE], while also providing flexibility for more frequent dialysis and thus greater personalization of care. The applicant stated that adequate dialysis for a standard, thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] treatment schedule is a single treatment clearance of urea, expressed as a single-pool [PERSON]56tV sp[PERSON]56tV of greater than 1.2 where [PERSON]56  dialyzer clearance, t  time, and V  Volume of distribution of urea. The applicant also stated that dialyzer clearance, or [PERSON]56, is dependent on the mass transfer coefficient [PERSON]56oA characteristics of the prescribed dialyzer and prescribed blood and dialysate flow rates. The applicant further noted that limitations in [PERSON]56 or t affect the ability of a patient to achieve adequate clearance during a dialysis treatment. Per the applicant, across a broad range of weights, patients using [ORGANIZATION] can achieve the target of dialysis adequacy, a single pool [PERSON]56tV of 1.2, with 3 treatments [DATE] in [TIME].39 The applicant also stated that when used 4 times [DATE], patients using [ORGANIZATION] had a higher mean [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] standard [PERSON]56tV with equivalent or better dialysis-related hospitalization rates,40 as compared to ORG[DATE]9 [ORGANIZATION] patients prescribed therapy at 6 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s [DATE].41--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39 [LOCATION]5, PERSON38 [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]s Dialyzed Thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] Using a Dialysate Flow of 300 m[ORGANIZATION]min, clinical abstract, presented [DATE] [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]0 Dialysis Conference, GPE14, GPE15. 40 [LOCATION]6, GPE16[PERSON]95 , [LOCATION]5, GPE25, ORG65 , PERSON49, [PERSON]2[PERSON]95 , PERSON50, [PERSON]2G , PERSON[DATE], [PERSON]2[ORGANIZATION] , [PERSON], [LOCATION][DATE], [PERSON] , [PERSON]3, ORG63 and [PERSON], M.A [DATE].

The applicant further stated that this facilitates the delivery of adequate dialysis clearance [PERSON]56tV in a standard duration and target frequency of 3 times [DATE], as well as alternate frequencies and durations as preferred by a patient or recommended by a health care provider. The applicant asserted that [ORGANIZATION],supreg when attached to its PureFlowTM device, requires users to batch a set amount of dialysate maximum of 60 liters in advance of a treatment or use sterile dialysate bags maximum of 30 liters. The applicant also stated that at its maximum dialysate flow rate [PERSON]58d of 300mlmin, ORG[DATE]9 greatly limits time by restricting treatment to a maximum of [TIME] before exhausting its dialysate capacity 200 min  60[ORGANIZATION]300mlmin. The applicant stated that [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] DO[ORGANIZATION] data demonstrate that the current [PERSON] practice for thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] dialysis occurs at an average treatment time of greater than [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]540 minutes, and has increased in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]91 Per the applicant, with the limited t, a single-pooled [PERSON]56tV of gt1.2 cannot be expected to be achieved for the majority of [PERSON] patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] on a thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] schedule, requiring increased treatment frequency 43 at home for these patients to meet the desired clearance level.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42 Tentori F, PERSON55, PERSON45 Y, [PERSON]56araboyas A, [PERSON]56err P, [LOCATION]4 R, Bommer [PERSON]95, [LOCATION]16 F, Akiba T, Pisoni R, Robinson B.

The applicant explained that because urea is evenly distributed throughout a bodys water, the volume of distribution of urea is equal to a patients total volume of water. The applicant also stated that total body water and volume of distribution of urea can be expressed as a volume or as a percentage of total weight and can vary based on numerous factors including disease state. The applicant stated that it is possible to estimate the percent of water for the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] population from the [ORGANIZATION] trial as summarized in PERSON4[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]45 The applicant stated that in the trial, the mean patient weight was 69.8kg and the mean patient volume of body water V was 30.9[ORGANIZATION] The applicant further explained that from this, total body water and volume of distribution of urea were calculated as 44.3 percent of the mean weight of patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] 44.3  30.9[ORGANIZATION]69.8kg x 100. Per the applicant, applying this 44.3 percent of total body weight to the volumes of distribution in PERSON4[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]46 allowed for the conversion of the kinetic model described into anticipated patient weights. The applicant further stated that in calculating with standard blood flow and a higher dialyzer mass transfer area coefficient for urea [PERSON]56oA dialyzer, a [TIME] treatment at a dialysate flow rate [PERSON]58d of 300mlmin would not achieve what the applicant refers to as the [PERSON] target sp[PERSON]56tV target 1.2 for patients with a volume of distribution of urea V of 35[ORGANIZATION] or greater. The applicant stated that these assumptions were drawn from ORG[DATE]9 technical specifications.4[DATE] 48 The applicant stated that at 44.3 percent of total weight, this volume of distribution of urea correlated to patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] with a mean weight above [DATE]9 kg [DATE]9  35GPE25443 or approximately 1[DATE]4 pounds. Per the applicant, patients at or above this weight cannot be expected to achieve a sp[PERSON]56tV urea of 1.2 on a thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] schedule using the ORG[DATE]9 system at its maximal dialysate flow rate.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 44 PERSON4[DATE], [PERSON]2[PERSON]56 , [LOCATION][DATE], GPE13, [PERSON]3, ORG63 , amp [LOCATION]5, GPE25 [DATE].

Specifically, per the applicant, [PERSON]s national coverage policy is to reimburse for dialysis care 3 times [DATE], regardless of the modality that is used, and health care providers are expected to ensure that patients receive adequate clearance with the 3 times [DATE] cadence. The applicant also stated that [PERSON]4s have discretion in reimbursing additional treatments with medical [PERSON] Per the applicant, an analysis of [PERSON][PERSON] 61896claims data from [PERSON] found that despite the limitations of the reimbursement policy, [PERSON] paid for 5 or more treatments [DATE] in 50 percent of home HD patients nationwide, amounting to an estimated [ORGANIZATION]1 cost to [PERSON] of 1[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54 to 126 million.51 PERSON8wever, as we stated in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], based on [PERSON] review of dialysis facility claims data, among all beneficiaries who had home dialysis treatments in [PERSON], 39.1 percent had 5 or more dialysis sessions at least once during [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]96. The overall percentage of beneficiary-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3 that had 5 or more home HD sessions in [PERSON] was 20.9 percent. [PERSON] payment for these additional sessions totaled 1[DATE] million. We noted that, as indicated in [ORGANIZATION]ocal Coverage Determination ID [ORGANIZATION][ZIP], [ORGANIZATION] revised effective [DATE], [DATE],[DATE] [PERSON] established payment for HD based on conventional treatment which is defined as 3 times [DATE]. Sessions in excess of 3 times [DATE] must be both reasonable and necessary in order to receive payment. Covered indications include metabolic conditions acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, fluid positive status not controlled with routine dialysis, pregnancy, heart failure, pericarditis, and incomplete dialysis secondary to hypotension or access issues. The applicant asserted that the use of [ORGANIZATION] would decrease the number of necessary dialysis treatments, without affecting patient outcomes such as clearance or hospitalizations.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 49 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]4.

Available at Reference Table G2.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant stated that while ORG[DATE]9 has not specifically reported the hospitalization rates per patient-[ORGANIZATION]20 from its [ORGANIZATION] study, published data from [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION],59 and PERSON44 [ORGANIZATION],60 reported hospital admission rates amongst patients on [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 home HD ranging from 930 to 1,663 per 1,000 patient-[DATE]81, using a national sample of dialysis patients matched for comparison to similar peritoneal and in-center dialysis patients. We clarified in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP]-[ZIP] that this would represent 930 to 1,663 cases observed among 1,000 persons during [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]38. The applicant also noted that all data on home patients in [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION] came from a matched cohort of ORG[DATE]9 patients. Per the applicant, in PERSON44 [ORGANIZATION], data were collected prior to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]56 and that during this timeframe, it could be reasonably assumed that home HD patients were using ORG[DATE]9 for treatment. The applicant stated that the results from these studies suggested that patients receiving treatment at home with ORG[DATE]9 5 to 6 times [DATE] do not have a lower all-cause hospitalization rate, relative to matched in-center HD patients. The applicant concluded by stating that because of the clinical and demographic diversity of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 patient population, the applicants results showed incremental improvement over the hospitalization rate of the current home HD population.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59 [LOCATION], [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] , PERSON42, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] , amp PERSON43, [PERSON][PERSON]95 [ORGANIZATION]5.

The applicant also stated that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 adherence rates were similar among both the prior in-center and prior self-care participants. The applicant stated that these results represent a significant improvement over the treatment adherence rate reported in the ORG[DATE]9 [ORGANIZATION], where the treatment compliance rate was defined less stringently as missing 5 or fewer treatments of the 48 possible treatments and was only 89 percent among patients at home and during the study period.64 Per the applicant, using a comparable metric of missing 5 or fewer of all possible treatments at home, ORG61supreg System [ORGANIZATION] patients at home had a 100 percent treatment compliance rate.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 62 [ORGANIZATION], [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]8, Incidence of Therapy Cessation among PERSON8me [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] presented, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]9 [ORGANIZATION]5. 63 [ORGANIZATION] and efficacy of the ORG61 hemodialysis system for in-center and home hemodialysis [LOCATION]6, GPE16[PERSON]95 , [LOCATION]5, GPE25, ORG65 , PERSON49, [PERSON]2[PERSON]95 , PERSON50, [PERSON]2G , PERSON[DATE], [PERSON]2[ORGANIZATION] , [PERSON], [LOCATION][DATE], [PERSON] , [PERSON]3, ORG63 and [PERSON], M.A [DATE], [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]. 64 PERSON40, M., [ORGANIZATION] A comparison of center-based vs. home-based [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 hemodialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease.

The applicant stated that a 96 percent response rate 216 of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]544 possible was achieved at the end of the study and that for both prior-in-center and ORG[DATE]9 study participants, in [DATE]9 percent of the treatment [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3, patients reported needing no assistance from their care partner in performing dialysis set-up, treatment, or breakdown. The applicant explained that among the 13 prior in-home patients, all of whom were formerly ORG[DATE]9 users, participants reported needing help from a trained individual with dialysis treatment in 69 percent of treatment [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3, with 46 percent of instances involving a need for device-related help. We clarified in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP]--[ZIP] that per [LOCATION]6, [ORGANIZATION],[DATE]3 this was the baseline percentage and reflected 9 of the 13 patients with previous self-care experience. The applicant stated that patients reported needing help with treatment in only 42 percent of treatment [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3 while using [ORGANIZATION], which was a 39 percent reduction from baseline ORG[DATE]9 use and only 18 percent of these instances related to use of [ORGANIZATION], which was a 61 percent reduction in rate from baseline ORG[DATE]9 use.[DATE]4--------------------------------------------------------------------------- [DATE]3 [LOCATION]6, Troy [PERSON]2, PERSON38 [LOCATION]5, PERSON30, [PERSON]95oseph [PERSON]2 PERSON49, PERSON32, PERSON33, PERSON34, [PERSON] GPE13 [LOCATION][DATE], Glenn M.

[DATE]4 Ibid.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant stated that it collected [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] data from patients by asking them to rate the extent to which they believed that they were a burden on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 representing never and 5 representing always. The applicant stated that this measure was adapted from an instrument used in assessing terminally ill patients.[DATE]5 The applicant stated that the subpopulation of study participants who had previously used ORG[DATE]9 reported an average score of 3.1 for self-perceived burden on their care partner when using their prior device, which subsequently reduced to 2.4 when using [ORGANIZATION] a 23 percent reduction in score from baseline ORG[DATE]9 use.[DATE]6 Per the applicant, these data underscored that a significant increase in patients confidence, ability to achieve treatment independence at home, and subsequent reduction in the sense of self burden can positively contributed to success in the home setting. The applicant further noted that the ease of use, reduced training time, and substantial reduction in care partner assistance required for[PERSON] [ZIP][ORGANIZATION] correlated to the improved retention and adherence rates in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study. The applicant stated that on a population level, this likely translated to reduced barriers to continuing home HD once initiated, and ultimately, a reduced risk of adverse outcomes due to missed treatments. The applicant also stated that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 electronic data capture and automatic wireless transmission eliminates the need for manual record keeping, which represented an improvement with respect to burden and monitoring as compared to ORG[DATE]9.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- [DATE]5 PERSON[DATE], PERSON8[DATE] , PERSON88, GPE25[PERSON]95 , PERSON89, GPE16F , [LOCATION]0, GPE16, [LOCATION]1, GPE13, amp [LOCATION]2, M.

[ORGANIZATION]5, 208, 1195-1206.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Per the applicant, while the ORG[DATE]9 [ORGANIZATION] study did not report results for a quality-of-life instrument, HR-[PERSON]58o[ORGANIZATION] was assessed in ORG[DATE]9 patients in a prospective multicenter observational study referred to as the [ORGANIZATION]6 trial, which examined the effects of at-home dialysis 6 times [DATE] with the ORG[DATE]9 System on costs and HR-[PERSON]58o[ORGANIZATION] using the [ORGANIZATION] instrument. The applicant further stated that the reported results at [DATE]05 follow-up among these patients [DATE]9 translates to a mean E[PERSON]58-5D score of 0.[DATE]0 The applicant included an appendix describing the Methodology to [ORGANIZATION] E[PERSON]58-5D Scores from the [ORGANIZATION]6 Study Results in its application and derived a predicted mean E[PERSON]58-5D score of 0.695-0.[DATE]0 at follow up for the [ORGANIZATION]6 study. The applicant further noted that because this estimate is based on the average aggregate change for an adjusted measure that was then translated to the E[PERSON]58-5D scale, and the applicant did not have access to standard error estimates for [ORGANIZATION] PCS, its interpretation of this estimate and its variance is limited. Per the applicant, nonetheless, it provided a sense of the comparable HR-[PERSON]58o[ORGANIZATION] of this sample of ORG[DATE]9 patients at follow-up. The applicant further noted that mean E[PERSON]58-5D index values for traditional HD and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients reported from a meta-analysis of existing studies in the literature are 0.56 95 percent [ORGANIZATION] 0.49-0.62 and 0.58 95 percent [ORGANIZATION] 0.5-0.6[DATE], respectively.80--------------------------------------------------------------------------- [DATE]9 PERSON41, [ORGANIZATION] , [ORGANIZATION] [DATE]8.

The applicant stated that, in the absence of a well-validated sleep survey specific to the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] population, study investigators selected survey questions from previously validated sleep questionnaires in the non-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] population, based on their relevance to the study population.84 85 The applicant explained that questions were designed to focus on quality of sleep and restfulness and noted that these measures are validated for use among chronically ill populations and measure the frequency of 4 key sleep-related symptoms. The applicant stated that, while at home, patients on [ORGANIZATION] reported improved quality of sleep, with a measurable reduction in rate of patient-reported sleep symptoms ranging from a 10-60 percent reduction, depending on symptom.[DATE] The applicant stated that this reduction was observed among study participants who were previously receiving dialysis in-center average magnitude of reduction in rate across symptoms 42 percent and among study participants who were previously receiving in-home dialysis on ORG[DATE]9 average magnitude of reduction in rate across symptoms 2[DATE] percent. Per the applicant, on average, sleep-related difficulties reduced from being reported in 33 percent of treatment [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3 while on ORG[DATE]9 to 23 percent of treatment [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3 while on [ORGANIZATION].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82 [PERSON], PERSON82 A, Moss AH, [PERSON]08, [PERSON], [PERSON]09 F, [PERSON]10 FE, [PERSON]11 S, GPE22, [PERSON]12 [PERSON]60, [PERSON]13 R[ORGANIZATION], ORG120 [PERSON]56idney Disease Improving Global Outcomes.

With respect to the applicants claim that patients can achieve dialysis adequacy in as little as 3 treatments [DATE], we noted that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study did not test whether patients receive adequate dialysis on a thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] schedule. Instead, data published from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study addressed a [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] measure of dialysis adequacy among patients treated on a 4 times [DATE] schedule. The applicant relied on modeling and unpublished data on patients receiving thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] dialysis in making the conclusion that dialysis adequacy can be reached on a thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] schedule. Specifically, the applicant referred to a theoretical modeling study based on historical data from the [DATE], [PERSON] claims, and historical outcomes from ORG[DATE]9 observational studies. The applicant also stated that findings from a retrospective review of 29 patients receiving treatment with [ORGANIZATION] on a thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] schedule affirmed the results from the modeling study. We also noted that the authors in [LOCATION]5 [ORGANIZATION]92 stated that conclusions about fluid removal could not be made from their study.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92 [LOCATION]5, PERSON38 [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]s Dialyzed Thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] Using a Dialysate Flow of 300 m[ORGANIZATION]min, clinical abstract, presented [DATE] [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]0 Dialysis Conference, GPE14, Texas.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- We stated that we were interested in whether additional studies were available that address issues related to effective fluid removal using home self-care dialysis thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] with [ORGANIZATION]. We invited comments on whether less frequent dialysis sessions would represent substantial clinical improvement over shorter, more frequent sessions that, according to the applicant, were common among users of the incumbent technology. The applicants second claim was that [ORGANIZATION] increased adherence to dialysis treatment and retention to home therapy, which may reduce dialysis-related hospitalizations and other adverse events associated with missing treatment. This claim was supported by [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study 28 participants completed the study and the use of historical comparisons to prior studies involving the ORG[DATE]9 System. The applicant noted that hospitalization rates from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] trial were lower than rates in the general dialysis population and rates reported in two observational studies of patients using the ORG[DATE]9 device. While the applicant cited an all-cause hospitalization rate of 426 per 1000 patient [DATE]81 in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study, we pointed out in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule that it did not appear that the sources [DATE] published these hospitalization rates. We further noted that the applicant relied on historical comparisons in asserting that that patients treated with [ORGANIZATION] experience reduced[PERSON] 61900disease burden and improved quality of life.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93 [ORGANIZATION] and efficacy of the ORG61 hemodialysis system for in-center and home hemodialysis [LOCATION]6, GPE16[PERSON]95 , [LOCATION]5, GPE25, ORG65 , PERSON49, [PERSON]2[PERSON]95 , PERSON50, [PERSON]2G , PERSON[DATE], [PERSON]2[ORGANIZATION] , [PERSON], [LOCATION][DATE], [PERSON] , [PERSON]3, ORG63 and [PERSON], M.A [DATE], [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]. 94 [PERSON]3, ORG63 , [LOCATION]5, GPE25, [LOCATION]6, GPE16[PERSON]95 , [LOCATION][DATE], [PERSON] , amp [PERSON], M.

[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE], 244, 480-4[DATE].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- We noted in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [DATE] that in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study, the before-after comparisons in patients with ORG[DATE]9 regarding improved sleep compared to prior to [ORGANIZATION] may be prone to recall bias in that participants experiences with ORG[DATE]9 were not recorded at the time they were receiving ORG[DATE]9 treatments, but rather, were based on recall at the time of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study. We stated that we understood that greater flexibility for patients in the [STREET] that they receive their dialysis treatments may represent a benefit to [PERSON] beneficiaries who are candidates to receive this treatment in the home setting. We invited comments on whether this potential benefit represents substantial clinical improvement, including whether [ORGANIZATION] represented an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the treatment of [PERSON] beneficiaries. We received multiple comments on the substantial clinical improvement claims made in the [ORGANIZATION] application for [ORGANIZATION], ranging from commenters with concerns about the claims, including from a manufacturer of a competitor device, to comments in support of the application, including from the applicant. The comments on the three substantial clinical improvement claims made by the applicant, and our responses to the comments, are set forth below. Comment A commenter, a manufacturer of a competitor device, asserted that [ORGANIZATION] does not meet the substantial clinical improvement criterion. The commenter asserted that the applicants claims were not supported by robust clinical evidence. The commenter made several criticisms about [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] trial and the other clinical evidence provided by the applicant, emphasizing the lack of a direct head-to-head comparison with the ORG[DATE]9 device as well as relying on theoretical modeling. For example, the commenter stated that the applicant did not submit adequate evidence to demonstrate its first claim, that decreased home HD treatment frequency with [ORGANIZATION] offered a substantial clinical benefit for home HD patients, because the applicants study examined patients that dialyzed on [ORGANIZATION] more than three times [DATE] and did not compare [ORGANIZATION] machine to the ORG[DATE]9 machine, which the commenter claimed is also capable of thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] dialysis. Further, the commenter stated that current models of the ORG[DATE]9 System OneTM offer dialysate flow rates of 300mlminute and ORG[DATE]9 patients can currently dialyze with any amount of dialysate prescribed by their doctor. The commenter asserted that the ORG[DATE]9 machine is more flexible than [ORGANIZATION] and that other incumbent systems, such as the ORG126 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3[PERSON]56homeTM, are capable of even more urea clearance than [ORGANIZATION] in the same amount of time. Even though the commenter stated that patients using other home HD machines are able to achieve dialysis adequacy on a thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] dialysis schedule, the commenter also stated that it was not aware of any additional data in support of adequate fluid removal using a thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] dialysis schedule with [ORGANIZATION]. The commenter also expressed concerns with the applicants claim that less frequent dialysis sessions may represent substantial clinical improvement over shorter, more frequent sessions because certain clinical and quality of life advancements, like more energy and vitality, are closely linked to more frequent treatments, which more closely mirror the natural function of a patients kidney. This same point was also raised by other commenters, including health care providers. These other commenters also expressed a preference for more frequent dialysis stating that it results in increased energy levels, improved sleep and mental health, and that patients undergoing more frequent dialysis need fewer dietary restrictions and antihypertensive and phosphate binder medications. Additionally, the commenter stated that evidence suggests there is no disadvantage in access complications for patients that undergo more frequent dialysis, while also noting that the applicant did not present studies that compared vascular access with [ORGANIZATION] to ORG[DATE]9. The commenter stated that the applicant did not provide sufficient clinical evidence for its claim that [ORGANIZATION] results in an incremental improvement in hospitalization rates because the sources that the applicant provided were not yet published. Similarly, the commenter asserted that the applicant did not demonstrate that [ORGANIZATION] increases adherence to the dialysis treatment and retention to home therapy because the studies cited by the applicant did not compare adherence, retention, or ease of use for [ORGANIZATION] with the ORG[DATE]9 or the ORG126 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3[PERSON]56homeTM systems. The commenter stated that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study on which the applicant relied to demonstrate treatment adherence and retention had several weaknesses including a small patient population, narrow patient inclusion criteria, and short duration. While the commenter acknowledged that the applicant did compare adherence rates from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Study to adherence in the ORG[DATE]9 [ORGANIZATION] study, the commenter explained that this methodology was not appropriate because the studies had different definitions of treatment compliance. The commenter noted that the applicants comparison of patient retention rates from [ORGANIZATION] and ORG[DATE]9 [ORGANIZATION] studies was similarly not appropriate because the equipment used during the time of the ORG[DATE]9 [ORGANIZATION] study was completely different from that which is widely used to[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19 that is, ORG[DATE]9 touchscreen VersiHDTM, [PERSON], PureFlowTM SGPE25 Also, regarding the applicants adherence claim, the commenter identified several factors that it argued may reduce dialysis adherence using [ORGANIZATION] and restrict its use to a small subset of dialysis patients. First, the commenter stated that patients without consistent access to clean tap water may be at risk for disruptions in dialysis treatment with [ORGANIZATION]. The commenter identified potential tap water disruptions such as water main breaks or the loss tap water during power outages for patients who rely on well-based water. The commenter further stated that water source disruptions do not hinder ORG[DATE]9 patients from continuing their treatment because they can treat with pre-mixed dialysate bags. The commenter concluded that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 on-demand dialysate production is not a substantial clinical improvement over the ORG[DATE]9 System OneTM with PureFlowTM S[ORGANIZATION]s on-site dialysate production. [ORGANIZATION]ond, the commenter stated, as did several other commenters, that [ORGANIZATION] increases electric and water utility expenses by requiring a large volume of water to complete the reverse osmosis process and because the system must heat the water prior to use for dialysate and for sterilization after treatment. Third, the commenter stated that [ORGANIZATION] has not received [PERSON] marketing authorization for solo home hemodialysis hemodialysis without a care partner during [TIME], as well as nocturnal home hemodialysis, whereas the ORG[DATE]9 System OneTM has received these [PERSON] marketing authorizations.[PERSON] [ZIP] The commenter stated that the applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to advance its claim that [ORGANIZATION] improves patient quality of life. The commenter stated that no comparison of incremental benefit in quality of life of [ORGANIZATION] over ORG[DATE]9 was provided. The commenter further stated that studies involving hundreds of patients have been specifically designed to test quality of life outcomes, among ORG[DATE]9 users and have been published in peer-reviewed journals demonstrating quality of life improvements among ORG[DATE]9 users. The commenter stated that there is a high bar for relying on quality of life evidence to demonstrate innovation, recognizing the breadth of evidence that exists for current technologies. Regarding the applicants evidence on its improved patient quality of life claim, the commenter stated that it was unable to confirm the applicants claim of a [DATE]0 percent reduction in the rate of patient-reported hypotensive symptoms while on [ORGANIZATION] and asserted that data also supports a reduction in intradialytic hypotensive episodes among ORG[DATE]9 patients, referring to an article by [PERSON]23 [ORGANIZATION]95--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95 [PERSON]23 M, [PERSON]24, [PERSON]25 AM, [PERSON]26 [PERSON]95[LOCATION]18 Comparison of intradialytic blood pressure variability between conventional thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] hemodialysis and short [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 hemodialysis.

Regarding the recall bias concern, additional commenters also wrote in with concurring comments. These commenters explained that participants experiences with ORG[DATE]9 were not recorded at the time they were receiving ORG[DATE]9 treatments, but rather, were based on recall at the time of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study. Regarding the applicants claim that [ORGANIZATION] users spend less time in training compared to existing technologies, the commenter questioned the applicants reference to 1[DATE] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s to complete training on [ORGANIZATION], stating that this timeframe includes training about aspects of home dialysis beyond the functionality of the machine. The commenter stated that only approximately 5 session-equivalents are machine-focused during training with ORG[DATE]9. The commenter also stated that because 13 patients in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study had previous home HD experience, the study participants would have already been trained on the most difficult aspects of home therapy, such as self-cannulation. Therefore, the commenter suggested review of a larger number of patients who are truly new to home therapy. The commenter rejected the applicants assertions that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 features are unique and stated that the applicant did not submit data demonstrating that [ORGANIZATION] is easier to use than other devices. The commenter stated its belief that many aspects of [ORGANIZATION] are more difficult to use than ORG[DATE]9 and highlighted key features that have become available since publication of the ORG[DATE]9 [ORGANIZATION] study. The commenter also challenged the applicants description of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 cartridge as being pre-strung compared to existing cartridges and stated that ORG[DATE]9 offers a cartridge that requires 4 fewer blood tubing connections. The commenter also stated that ORG[DATE]9 systems are the only home HD systems approved for self-treatment without a care partner, addressing partner fatigue. The commenter and several members of the public identified the ability to travel as a quality of life issue. They stated that because [ORGANIZATION] weighs nearly 200 pounds, it is not portable, while the ORG[DATE]9 device is lighter and portable. Due to its portability, the competitor commenter added that [DATE]0 percent of ORG[DATE]9 users reported traveling while using the machine. Finally, this commenter stated that while certain patients may prefer certain features of [ORGANIZATION], the presence of an additional option for home dialysis machine does not in itself represent a clinical improvement. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the input provided by the commenters. We have taken this information into consideration in our determination of whether [ORGANIZATION] meets the eligibility criteria at [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1, and have responded in further detail to comments discussing the significant clinical improvement claims for [ORGANIZATION] at the end of this section of the final rule. Comment We received a comment from the applicant in support of the [ORGANIZATION] approval for [ORGANIZATION]. With respect to the claim that patients can achieve dialysis adequacy in as little as three treatments [DATE] and the concern we expressed in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study did not test whether patients receive adequate dialysis on a thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] schedule, the applicant clarified that the intent was not to position three times [DATE] home dialysis as substantial clinical improvement over short [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 or more frequent dialysis. Instead, their claim is that more frequent dialysis, which they believe is a requirement for [ORGANIZATION], is significantly more burdensome for patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] for whom thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] treatments may be appropriate. The applicant stated that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 ability to achieve [PERSON]56tV targets of 1.2 on a thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] treatment schedule at home represents substantial clinical improvement because they believe it allows patients the benefits of home dialysis whether administered three or four times [DATE], which had not been an option previously because of the technical limitations of the ORG[DATE]9 system. Specifically, per the applicant, on a standard treatment duration, three [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19 [DATE] schedule patients with weights above [DATE]9kg do not have sufficient dialysate with ORG[DATE]9 maximum of 60[ORGANIZATION] to achieve the [PERSON] mandated target without increasing the amount of time per treatment that the patient has to dialyze. The applicant further stated that [ORGANIZATION] can achieve levels of efficiency nearly on par with in-center hemodialysis on conventional hardware. The applicant also noted that patients treated with ORG[DATE]9 would exhaust its dialysate at [TIME] at an equivalent dialysate flow rate of 300mlmin. In support of that claim, the applicant referred to kinetic modeling, the clearance kinetics of the ORG[DATE]9 dialyzer, and the percentage of body water [DATE] in patients weighing 1[DATE]4 pounds or greater. The applicant concluded that patients treated with ORG[DATE]9 would require greater than thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] treatments to achieve hemodialysis adequacy with sp[PERSON]56tV of gt1.2 The applicant stated that because [ORGANIZATION] is able to generate dialysate on demand at 300mlmin for up to 1[TIME] without volume limitations, it allows patients the flexibility to adequately dialyze at the frequency that is best for them rather[PERSON] 61902than requiring them to perform more frequent treatments.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 96 PERSON4[DATE], [PERSON]2 [LOCATION]1, [LOCATION][DATE], GPE13, [PERSON]3, [PERSON] M., amp [LOCATION]5, GPE25 [DATE].

The applicant emphasized that evidence from published and unpublished sources may be sufficient in establishing substantial clinical improvement. In response to concerns regarding the sufficiency of the clinical evidence presented, the applicant commented that because the patient population in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study, was more diverse and reflective of the general dialysis population with respect to diabetes and other comorbidities than the population in the ORG[DATE]9 [ORGANIZATION] study, study results regarding ORG61supreg System can be better applied to the [PERSON] population. In their application, the applicant claimed that ORG61supreg System patients can be expected to have fewer vascular access interventions, and health care providers will have increased flexibility in personalizing the frequency and duration of patient treatments.98 99 The applicant emphasized in its comment that ORG61supreg System users may experience reduced vascular access infection related hospitalizations, relying on data from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study. The applicant stated that patients prescribed 5-6 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] dialysis sessions with ORG[DATE]9 who were converted to 4 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] dialysis sessions with [ORGANIZATION], experienced no hospitalizations during the home arm of the trial. The applicant commented that these data were not included in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] publication because the sample size was modest and relatively few patients required hospitalization. The applicant also stated that 14 of the 35 patients enrolled in the ORG[DATE]9 [ORGANIZATION] dropped out before completing the trial, making it difficult to calculate an unbiased estimate of the hospitalization rate. The applicant compared [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] hospitalization rate to two North American observational studies by [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]100 and PERSON44 [ORGANIZATION]101 of patients receiving home HD likely ORG[DATE]9 or [PERSON]56PERSON8me. The applicant further stated that PERSON44 [ORGANIZATION] reported a hospitalization rate of 930 per 1000 patient-[DATE]81 and [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION] noted a rate of [DATE] per 1000 patient-[DATE]81. The applicant stated that results from these studies suggest that patients receiving treatment at home with ORG[DATE]9 5-6 times [DATE] had similar, not lower, rates of hospitalization relative to matched patients receiving in-center hemodialysis. The applicant further noted that the modest sample size of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] precludes valid inference testing, but that the hospitalization rate observed 426 per 1000 patient-[DATE]81 was roughly one-quarter that seen among a national cohort of patients on home HD in the GPE2[DATE], and less than one-half that seen among a Canadian cohort, despite the high proportion of non-white patients and patients with diabetes, characteristics typically associated with higher rates of [LOCATION] ORG128.

The applicant submitted new data to further establish [DATE]16 attrition comparisons. The applicant stated that it contracted with a third-party research firm [ORGANIZATION] to conduct an analysis of patients dialyzing at home using [ORGANIZATION], matched to patients in the [DATE] who completed home HD training between [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]24s [ORGANIZATION]5 through [PERSON]. Per the applicant, home HD attrition was defined as either death or conversion to in-facility HD and kidney transplantation was excluded from attrition. The applicant further stated that the cohort included 39 patients that initiated home HD with [ORGANIZATION] since the devices [PERSON] marketing authorization for home use in [DATE] of [ORGANIZATION].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- [ORGANIZATION] Analysis conducted by ORG130, a division of the Hennepin [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]8 Research Institute.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant further clarified that this patient population is separate and distinct from the participants in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study. The applicant stated that there were 4 attrition events among the 39 ORG61supreg System users and 3,602 attrition events among the 9,82[DATE] home HD starts in the broader population of patients receiving home H[LOCATION]18 The applicant further noted that the cumulative incidence of attrition at [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]38 was 26.8 percent among ORG61supreg System users and 42.5 percent among all home HD starts with the unadjusted Cox regression hazard ratio of home HD attrition among ORG61supreg System users versus home HD starts in [DATE]81 [ORGANIZATION]5 through [PERSON] at 0.38 95 confidence interval, 0.14-1.02 p  0.06, a more than 60 percent reduction in attrition with [ORGANIZATION]. The applicant also acknowledged that the limited sample size reduces power in demonstrating a statistically significant result, but asserted that the preliminary data suggest that use of [ORGANIZATION] should reduce home HD attrition. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, [PERSON] acknowledged the applicants claim regarding the benefit of greater flexibility for patients in the [STREET] that they receive their dialysis treatments. The applicant stated in their comment that [ORGANIZATION] represents substantial clinical improvement over ORG[DATE]9 in several ways Allowing patients, in consultation with their clinicians, to develop a treatment schedule tailored to their individual needs, reducing the time spent on dialysis-related tasks including the elimination of a [TIME] pre-treatment dialysate production, and reducing supply storage requirements. With respect to the claim that [ORGANIZATION] improves patient quality of life, the applicant stated in their comment that ORG61supreg System [ORGANIZATION] showed favorable effects on patient-reported outcomes, including the E[PERSON]58-5D survey instrument that has been widely applied to many chronic disease populations, as well as a number of surveys related to the process of home dialysis. The applicants comment included the results from an online survey conducted by a third-party research firm ORG1[DATE] and a network of dialysis organizations and regional offices 104 between [PERSON]95uly 29 and [DATE] 9, [ORGANIZATION]8. Per[PERSON] 61903the applicant, 184 nephrologists and 202 patients were surveyed regarding a list of potential benefits and system features of a blinded home HD system concept reflecting the features of [ORGANIZATION]. The applicant stated that [DATE][DATE] percent of nephrologists rated the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 features as a substantial clinical improvement in home HD care and 98 percent indicated that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 benefits would make them more likely to recommend home HD to their patients. The applicant further stated that [DATE]2 percent of patients receiving in-center HD or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] rated the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 features as a significant improvement in home HD care and [DATE][DATE] percent of those patients stated they would be more likely to try home H[LOCATION]18 The applicant stated that of the current home HD population dialyzing on the incumbent device, 84 percent rated the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 features as a significant improvement in home HD care.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ORG1[DATE] Health Advances, GPE2[DATE] PERSON8me [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Nephrologist and [PERSON] Perspectives Presentation, [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]8. 104 [ORGANIZATION]3.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicants comment acknowledged that ORG[DATE]9 would be an available option to patients who prefer to travel with a home dialysis device but stated that the majority of patients ranked the effectiveness of treatment above the ability to travel with their device. With respect to [PERSON]s recall bias concern that participants experiences with ORG[DATE]9 were not recorded at the time they were receiving ORG[DATE]9 treatments, but rather, were based on recall at the time of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study, the applicant clarified that 13 of the 29 ORG61supreg System [ORGANIZATION] study participants who completed the trial had been dialyzing at home with ORG[DATE]9 in advance of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study and that baseline surveys were taken while patients were actively treating with ORG[DATE]9. The applicant commented that survey questions were sourced from validated sleep questionnaires and did not ask patients for a comparison to a prior time point, but focused on a rating of sleep during [DATE]22. The applicant commented that to further assess the prevalence of sleep related symptoms in home HD patients, a third-party research firm conducted a survey of current non-ORG61supreg System HD patients. The applicant stated that of home HD respondents, 64 percent reported very poor to poor sleep quality and all respondents stating that improved sleep would represent substantial clinical improvement.105 The applicant stated that collectively, its results confirm that achieving satisfactory sleep remains a major challenge for patients on dialysis and that using [ORGANIZATION] has the potential to improve sleep quality, which may also enhance physical, cognitive, and sexual function, and expand functional capacity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 105 Health Advances, GPE2[DATE] PERSON8me [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Nephrologist and [PERSON] Perspectives Presentation, [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]8.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicants comment emphasized the safety features and ease-of-use of [ORGANIZATION]. The applicant stated that [ORGANIZATION] offers patients a differentiated level of safety in having met higher, more updated safety standards of performance, such as fluid removal, air detection, temperature, dialysate flow rate and other parameters than the previously approved ORG[DATE]9 device. The applicant also stated that the remote monitoring and remote technical support features are only available with [ORGANIZATION] and reduce patient apprehension to perform treatments at home. The applicants comment again asserted that, overall, the totality of the evidence demonstrates that [ORGANIZATION] offers substantial clinical improvement in home HD treatment. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the applicant for their comment and have taken the additional information provided into consideration in our determination of whether [ORGANIZATION] meets the eligibility criteria at [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1. We have responded in further detail to comments discussing the significant clinical improvement claims for [ORGANIZATION] at the end of this section II.[PERSON]5.c of the final rule. Comment We received many comments from clinicians, patients, and caregivers supporting the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 [ORGANIZATION] application. For example, many commenters stated that using [ORGANIZATION] is convenient and allows for the flexibility to personalize treatment for a diversity of patient needs. Commenters stated that patients are allowed to create their own schedules, which enables them to continue working and enjoying lifes activities. [PERSON] commenters stated that they have become more active and engaged participants in their own care. Commenters appreciated the convenience and comfort of being able to dialyze at home instead of in-center, stating that doing so alleviates stress, reduces exposure to [ORGANIZATION] and reduces the burden of arranging for and traveling to in-center treatments. [PERSON] and caregiver commenters expressed appreciation for the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 on-demand dialysate for several reasons. First, commenters stated that patients have more dialysis-free time by not needing to prepare solution or handle heavy bags of dialysate. [ORGANIZATION]ond, commenters stated that there are fewer supplies to store for [ORGANIZATION] as compared to the ORG[DATE]9 System for which it was necessary to store up to 20 boxes of dialysate and supplies. Third, commenters stated that dialysate delivery may be challenged in regions with extreme climates and could compromise treatment. Commenters also stated that there is less wasted dialysate with use of [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] commenters identified several clinical improvements that they attribute to treatment with [ORGANIZATION] including reduced cramping and fatigue after dialysis treatment, reduced need for blood pressure medication, improved mood, and less frequent use and wear on the vascular access site with fewer [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] treatments. Commenters also stated that that features and conveniences of [ORGANIZATION] result in less burn out 106 of patients and caregivers, better adherence, retention and overall quality of life.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 106 As discussed in the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR [DATE]1462, a significant challenge to increasing the use of home dialysis includes burn out or technique failure and return to in-center H[LOCATION]18 According to one recent observational study, approximately 25 percent of patients who initiate home HD return to in-center HD within [DATE]24 [ORGANIZATION] R[PERSON]56, [PERSON]35, [PERSON]36 [ORGANIZATION], PERSON45 [PERSON]95, [PERSON]38, [PERSON]39, [PERSON]26 [PERSON]95D, [PERSON]40 [ORGANIZATION]M. Factors Associated With Discontinuation of PERSON8me [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. ORG12[DATE]. [ORGANIZATION]5 Apr6[DATE]4629-3[DATE].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Many commenters including patients, caregivers and clinicians commented on the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 features and ease-of-use. Commenters stated that the complexity of a dialysis machine and lengthy training can be intimidating and act as a deterrent in the adoption of home dialysis. Commenters stated that some patients and caregivers cannot afford extended absences from work, childcare or other responsibilities to complete dialysis training and that training with [ORGANIZATION] ranges from 10 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s to 2 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3 compared to training with ORG[DATE]9 which averages 4-6 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3. Several commenters stated that patients with prior home dialysis experience can begin home treatments using [ORGANIZATION] after just 3-4 training [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s. One commenter stated that a comparison of training for [ORGANIZATION] versus other devices in the market does not exist. Commenters stated that patients may also fear not being able to remember what to do in an urgent situation and highlighted the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 safety features that prevent patient harm, including step-by-step instructions with less memorization, and fewer treatment steps, and 24[DATE] technical support.[PERSON] 61904Commenters stated that remote treatment monitoring in real time, allows clinicians to intervene as needed with treatment modifications. Commenters stated that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 instructions can be set in other languages. Commenters also expressed appreciation for the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 built-in warmer that helps to prevent hypothermia during treatment, built-in blood pressure monitoring, flush feature, closed loop cartridge to minimize risk of infection, automatic record keeping, and the quicker set up and take down times. Commenters stated that [ORGANIZATION] looks less like an intrusive medical device and the built-in wheels make it easy to move it from room to room. One commenter stated that patients previously not deemed suitable for home HD, due to large body size, work schedules, etc. may now become candidates with the use of [ORGANIZATION]. Another commenter stated that patients lacking social support and financial resources may not be good candidates for home dialysis. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the input provided by these commenters. We have taken this information into consideration in our determination of whether [ORGANIZATION] meets the eligibility criteria at [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1. We have responded in further detail to comments discussing the significant clinical improvement claims for [ORGANIZATION] at the end of this section II.[PERSON]5.c of the final rule. Comment We received several comments from health care providers and patients regarding [ORGANIZATION] and less frequent dialysis treatments. A physician commenter stated that the question of whether less frequent dialysis is clinically preferable to shorter, more frequent dialysis sessions does not appear to be definitively decided in clinical research for all patients. The commenter stated that while patients derive significant benefit from more frequent dialysis, having the ability to achieve at least adequate dialysis at three [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s [DATE] is a significant advancement compared with what has been offered. Commenters stated that the treating clinician remains in the best position to prescribe the appropriate frequency of dialysis for their patients but that it is possible for researchers to accurately assess improvements in clinical outcomes related to frequency of dialysis treatments. A commenter, who is a health care provider, shared their experience with [ORGANIZATION] in a dialysis unit, stating that their unit tested [ORGANIZATION] and found that on the whole, the patients could reach dialysis adequacy on a traditional thrice-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] frequency. While this commenter referred to an abstract documenting these results, it was not provided. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the input provided by these commenters. We have taken this information into consideration in our determination of whether [ORGANIZATION] meets the eligibility criteria at [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1. We have responded in further detail to comments discussing the significant clinical improvement claims for [ORGANIZATION] at the end of this section II.[PERSON]5.c of the final rule. Comment We received several comments from the public, including health care providers and patients, regarding how to demonstrate substantial clinical improvement in connection with a home hemodialysis machine such as [ORGANIZATION]. One commenter stated that clinical trials, abstract data and expert opinion is sufficient to support substantial clinical improvement and that this type of evidence is often the basis of clinical guidelines from the [ORGANIZATION]3 N[PERSON]56F [PERSON]56idney Disease Outcome [PERSON]58uality Initiative. The commenter stated that new companies are not equipped to conduct in-depth studies until they have significant numbers of patients on their device or therapy which creates a barrier to recruiting study participants and thus, limiting investment in the new technology. Another commenter stated that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] sector does not easily lend itself to robust clinical trials, and this fact should be considered when determining whether an applicant for [ORGANIZATION] has demonstrated substantial clinical improvement. Commenters referred to the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] application template, which indicates that published, unpublished, and clinical expertise are all acceptable forms of supporting evidence and that placing a heavy emphasize on published long-term studies for purposes of evaluating substantial clinical improvement limits the ability of new companies to enter the market and deprives patients of potentially lifesaving technologies. A non-profit dialysis association stated that [PERSON] should consider the extent to which the technology has demonstrated improved quality of life in determining whether the technology represents substantial clinical improvement. Many commenters stated that patients should be given a choice in deciding which home hemodialysis machine is best for them, and that providing patients with an additional choice is evidence of substantial clinical improvement. A physician commenter indicated that it is not clear why patients prefer one machine over another or feel better with one prescription over another, but a choice based on patient preference can improve patient retention to a particular therapy, one of the ways to demonstrate substantial clinical improvement. This commenter stated that evidence that a home dialysis machine improves retention should be sufficient evidence to approve the [ORGANIZATION] for that home dialysis machine. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the commenters input regarding whether [ORGANIZATION] meets the innovation criterion at [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] and substantial clinical improvement criteria at [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1. After carefully reviewing the application, the information submitted by the applicant addressing our concerns raised in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, as well as the many comments submitted by the public, we agree with the applicant and several members of the dialysis community that [ORGANIZATION] represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the treatment of [PERSON] beneficiaries. We find that the data submitted demonstrate greater medication adherence or compliance of home HD among users of [ORGANIZATION] that is not as evident for users of existing home HD technologies, as specified under [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1C[DATE]. We also believe that [ORGANIZATION] may provide added flexibility around the frequency and duration of home HD that could benefit some patients, specifically, patients who may prefer fewer, slightly longer treatments but who would otherwise be limited to more frequent home HD treatments. We believe additional flexibilities around home HD treatments may represent an improvement in one or more activities of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 living and an improved quality of life for [PERSON] beneficiaries, as specified under [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1C4 and [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1C5, respectively. We also recognize that patient preference and choice is especially important for patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], who undergo demanding, often grueling, dialysis therapy, and we believe that patients who prefer their method and frequency of dialysis are more likely to adhere to the therapy, and thus increase adherence rates overall. We acknowledge the concerns raised by commenters regarding the substantial clinical improvement claims in [ORGANIZATION] application. As we had previously noted in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, we had some of the same concerns as commenters regarding[PERSON] 61905the evidence submitted to support the claims of significant clinical improvement. PERSON8wever, at this time, we feel that our concerns have been sufficiently addressed. For example, with respect to the applicants claim that [ORGANIZATION] increases adherence to dialysis treatment and retention to home therapy, although the adherence and retention data provided in the initial application had limitations, additional information was submitted by the applicant to support this claim in its comment on the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule. This data showed lower attrition rates at [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]38 between patients using [ORGANIZATION] for home HD, separate from the group of patients in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], matched with patients who had completed home HD patients, using data from the [DATE]. With respect to the applicants claim that [ORGANIZATION] improves patient quality of life, we note that the applicant addressed our concerns about the potential for recall bias in their claim of improved sleep quality and related symptoms in their comment, explaining that baseline surveys were taken while patients were actively treating with ORG[DATE]9. Also, while some commenters opposed the applicants use of unpublished data to support its claim of improved hospitalization, we note that under [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] and 412.8[DATE]b1iii, [PERSON] may consider unpublished data in making a determination of substantial clinical improvement as we recognize in some situations, published data may not be available. Overall, we believe the applicant was able to address our concerns about its substantial clinical improvement claims from the discussion in the [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] proposed rule. We also note that, under our [ORGANIZATION] policy and [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1i, [PERSON] is required to consider the totality of the circumstances when making a determination that a new renal dialysis equipment or supply represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of [PERSON] beneficiaries. We believe the circumstances we may consider in our review of the [ORGANIZATION] applications, specifically within the context of the [ORGANIZATION], include the state of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] landscape and the particular challenges and vulnerabilities of patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. While we recognize that published studies and randomized controlled trials are often the gold standard in demonstrating superiority of one product over another, our review is not limited to evidence from large randomized controlled trials we also consider a range of evidence from published or unpublished information sources, including other appropriate information sources not otherwise listed under [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1iii. As codified under [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1iii, evidence from published or unpublished information sources may be sufficient to establish that a new technology represents a substantial clinical improvement. Additional information we considered in our review of [ORGANIZATION] was the new data provided by the applicant surveying over 180 nephrologists and over 200 patients undergoing dialysis treatment HD, along with substantial supportive comments from patients, caregivers, and health care providers, about the benefits of [ORGANIZATION] in providing an improved quality of life, an improvement in one or more activities of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]26 living, and a decreased rate of at least one subsequent therapeutic intervention, as specified under [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. 12.8[DATE]b1C6, 412.8[DATE]b1C5, 412.8[DATE]b1C2, respectively. We also note that, at this time, patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] are facing new, additional risks when receiving dialysis treatment due to the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic. As some of the commenters noted, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients are among the most vulnerable in the [PERSON] population and are at an increased risk for [ORGANIZATION] associated morbidity and mortality.10[DATE] 108 As we discussed in the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule, [PERSON]s [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] population aligns with the profile of patients who are more susceptible to [ORGANIZATION]. As we stated in that rule, we believe it is important to reduce the risk of infection among beneficiaries with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], and this can be done through isolating patients from in-center exposure by encouraging home HD 85 FR [DATE]1416. We also believe that providing patients with an additional option for home HD is especially important given that the adoption of home HD has been limited, with approximately only 1 of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients utilizing this modality.109 Therefore, we are interested in supporting the use of technologies that expand patient options for dialyzing safely at home at this time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10[DATE] [PERSON]41 R, [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]56N, [PERSON]42, [ORGANIZATION] Excess Death Estimates in [PERSON]s with End-Stage [ORGANIZATION]--GPE28, [DATE] [ORGANIZATION].

Uptodate. [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]5.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- For all of these reasons, we conclude that [ORGANIZATION] meets the [ORGANIZATION] innovation criteria under [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]. 412.8[DATE]b1.6 Capital Related Assets Criterion [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]6 Regarding the final [ORGANIZATION] eligibility criterion under [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]6, whether the item is a capital-related asset that is a home dialysis machine, these terms are defined in [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE]. The applicant identified [ORGANIZATION] as an asset that an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility has an economic interest in through ownership, is subject to depreciation, and is an HD machine that received [PERSON] marketing authorization for home use. We received no public comments on this criterion. We agree that [ORGANIZATION] is a capital-related asset and home dialysis machine and therefore meets this criterion. The remaining comments and our responses regarding [ORGANIZATION] and its eligibility for the [ORGANIZATION] are set forth below. Comment We received a comment that [DATE]0 of the patient population in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] study were non-white, suggesting [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 ability to create greater home adoption and retention in ways that are aligned with the proposed incentive for closing gaps in health equity access to home H[LOCATION]18 [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenter for their input. While health equity is not a specific [ORGANIZATION] eligibility criteria under [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], we strongly support health equity and believe that the approval of [ORGANIZATION] under the criterion of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] will encourage uptake of home HD for vulnerable patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. Comment We received several comments pertaining to the relationship between the cost of [ORGANIZATION] and its connection to beneficiary access. Several commenters stated that the initial cost of [ORGANIZATION] is 2 to 3 times that of older technologies, and that combined with potentially fewer treatments over which to amortize the cost, it would be difficult for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities to incorporate [ORGANIZATION] into their businesses without a payment adjustment under the [ORGANIZATION]. These commenters expressed support for [PERSON] approving the [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION]. The applicant stated that after the initial capital investment, the per treatment costs of using [ORGANIZATION] are considerably less than that of the ORG[DATE]9 System. Another commenter stated that [ORGANIZATION] is more affordable than other home dialysis machines and is cost[PERSON] 61906effective. Commenters stated that a [ORGANIZATION] approval for [ORGANIZATION] would help to offset the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 acquisition costs, particularly for small and mid-size dialysis organizations and independent providers and facilitate economies of scale, allowing [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities to lower the cost of home HD care in the future. Commenters also asserted that a [ORGANIZATION] approval would increase home dialysis utilization and retention of patients on home dialysis, and improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes, overall. For example, several commenters stated that use of [ORGANIZATION] may help to push the national home hemodialysis prevalence above its stagnant level of 2 percent and a [ORGANIZATION] approval would further support the goals of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the commenters input. We note that cost is not a consideration for [ORGANIZATION] eligibility under [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], and therefore is not relevant to our review of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3 application. PERSON8wever, we believe that approval of [ORGANIZATION] supports the goals of the [ORGANIZATION] model by expanding beneficiary access to and retention of home H[LOCATION]18 Comment The ORG61supreg System applicant commented on the [PERSON] spending estimate of [PERSON] payment for additional home HD sessions, noting differences between its analysis and that of [PERSON] but agreeing with [PERSON] estimates on spending for the fifth treatment. Several commenters stated that while existing guidance 110 allows for treatments more than three times [DATE] when they are reasonable and necessary, coverage decisions are unrelated to the [ORGANIZATION] eligibility determination. A commenter stated that the applicant provided no evidence regarding dialysis frequency for the population of patients that meet [PERSON]s clinical coverage criteria for additional treatments.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 110 [PERSON] Coverage Database. Retrieved [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]8 from [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their input and note that our [PERSON] spending estimate of [PERSON] payment for additional home HD sessions that was included in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP] was not part of our analysis of the [ORGANIZATION] eligibility criteria in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. In addition, while [PERSON] clinical coverage criteria are beyond the scope of this rulemaking, we are not suggesting that the [STREET] in which [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities reflect home HD treatments on their claims would change due to our decision on [ORGANIZATION] application. Comment We received several comments from health care professionals with experience in using [ORGANIZATION] in a clinical setting, rather than a home setting. One commenter stated that [ORGANIZATION] is a benefit for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities with staffing shortages because less time will need to be spent with each patient. Several commenters shared their favorable experiences in using [ORGANIZATION] in the hospital inpatient and intensive care unit settings and in treating [ORGANIZATION] patients. One commenter stated that 15 [ORGANIZATION] inpatients with a mean age of [DATE][DATE] were provided multiple ORG61supreg System treatments 3-6 times [DATE]. The commenter further explained that the best urea reduction ratio achieved in the first 1-4 treatments, if available, was 41 most treatments were successful and were slowed for hypotension or tachycardia and some were aborted because of water pressure alarms signaling the need for filter replacement or clotted lines related to hypercoagulability among [ORGANIZATION] patients. The commenter further stated that most treatments were limited to [TIME] but up to [TIME]. Some commenters stated that patients treated with [ORGANIZATION] in the hospital or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility setting gain familiarity and comfort with the device making it an easier transition to using the system at home. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their input. Currently, the only capital-related assets not excluded from eligibility for the [ORGANIZATION] under [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]6 are home dialysis machines used in the home for a single patient, as defined in [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE]. While these commenters experiences with [ORGANIZATION] do not involve its use in the home setting, we appreciate the additional input regarding the benefits of [ORGANIZATION]. After a consideration of all the public comments received, we have determined that the evidence and public comments submitted are sufficient to demonstrate that [ORGANIZATION] meets all of the eligibility criteria to qualify for the [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION]. As a result, [ORGANIZATION] will be paid for using a [ORGANIZATION] per [ORGANIZATION]. 413.236d.III. [PERSON] for [ORGANIZATION] Furnished to Individuals With Acute [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION][PERSON] The Trade Preferences Extension [ORGANIZATION] of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]56 [ORGANIZATION]. GPE25 [DATE] was enacted on [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE], and amended the [ORGANIZATION] to provide coverage and payment for dialysis furnished by an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility to an individual with acute [PERSON]. Specifically, section 808a of the [ORGANIZATION] amended section 1[DATE]1s2F of the [ORGANIZATION] to provide coverage for renal dialysis services furnished on or after [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]8 by a renal dialysis facility or a provider of services paid under section 1881b14 of the [ORGANIZATION] to an individual with [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]tion 808b of the [ORGANIZATION] amended section 1834 of the [ORGANIZATION] by adding a subsection r to provide payment, beginning [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]8 for renal dialysis services furnished by renal dialysis facilities or providers of services paid under section 1881b14 of the [ORGANIZATION] to individuals with [ORGANIZATION] at the [ORGANIZATION] base rate, as adjusted by any applicable geographic adjustment applied under section 1881b14DivII of the [ORGANIZATION] and adjusted on a budget neutral basis for payments under section 1834r of the [ORGANIZATION] by any other adjustment factor under section 1881b14D of the [ORGANIZATION] that the [ORGANIZATION]retary elects. In the [DATE]32 [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we finalized several coverage and payment policies to implement subsection r of section 1834 of the [ORGANIZATION] and the amendments to section 1881s2F of the [ORGANIZATION], including the payment rate for [ORGANIZATION] dialysis 81 FR [DATE][DATE][DATE]6 through [DATE], and [DATE]. We interpret section 1834r1 of the [ORGANIZATION] as requiring the amount of payment for [ORGANIZATION] dialysis services to be the base rate for renal dialysis services determined for DATE[DATE]4 under the [ORGANIZATION] base rate as set forth in [ORGANIZATION]. 413.[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]540, updated by the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] bundled market basket percentage increase factor minus a productivity adjustment as set forth in [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE], adjusted for wages as set forth in [ORGANIZATION]. 413.2[DATE], and adjusted by any other amounts deemed appropriate by the [ORGANIZATION]retary under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.3[DATE]3 We codified this policy in [ORGANIZATION]. 413.3[DATE]2 81 FR [DATE].B. Summary of [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] to Comments on the [ORGANIZATION] Payment for [ORGANIZATION] Furnished to Individuals With [ORGANIZATION] The proposed rule, titled [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION], Payment[PERSON] 6190[DATE]for [ORGANIZATION] Furnished to Individuals With Acute [PERSON], End-Stage [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Incentive [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] Model [DATE] FR 363[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54 through [DATE], referred to as the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, was published in [ORGANIZATION] on DATE[DATE]1, with a comment period that ended on DATE[DATE]2. In that proposed rule, we proposed to update the [ORGANIZATION] dialysis payment rate for [ORGANIZATION]. We received 6 public comments on our proposal from large dialysis organizations, ORG16, a professional association, a provider advocacy organization, and a [ORGANIZATION] group. In this final rule, we provide a summary of each proposed provision, a summary of the public comments received and our responses to them, and the policies we are finalizing for [ORGANIZATION] payment for renal dialysis services furnished to individuals with [ORGANIZATION].[PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]0 Payment Rate Update for [ORGANIZATION] The payment rate for [ORGANIZATION] dialysis is the [ORGANIZATION] base rate determined for DATE[DATE]4 under section 1881b14 of the [ORGANIZATION], which is the finalized [ORGANIZATION] base rate, including the applicable [ORGANIZATION]1 productivity-adjusted market basket payment update, geographic wage adjustments, and any other discretionary adjustments, for [DATE]33. We note that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities could bill [PERSON] for non-renal dialysis items and services and receive separate payment in addition to the payment rate for [ORGANIZATION] dialysis. As discussed in section II.B.1.d of this final rule, the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] base rate is 25[DATE].90, which reflects the application of the [ORGANIZATION] wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor of 0.[ZIP] and the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] market basket increase of 2.4 percent reduced by the productivity adjustment of 0.5 percentage point, that is, 1.9 percent. Accordingly, we are finalizing a [ORGANIZATION] per treatment payment rate of 25[DATE].90 for renal dialysis services furnished by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities to individuals with [ORGANIZATION]. This payment rate is further adjusted by the wage index, as discussed in the next section of this final rule.2. Geographic Adjustment Factor Under section 1834r1 of the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. 413.3[DATE]2, the amount of payment for [ORGANIZATION] dialysis services is the base rate for renal dialysis services determined for DATE[DATE]4 under section 1881b14 of the [ORGANIZATION] updated by the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] bundled market basket and reduced by the productivity adjustment, as adjusted by any applicable geographic adjustment factor applied under section 1881b14DivII of the [ORGANIZATION]. Accordingly, we apply the same wage index under [ORGANIZATION]. 413.2[DATE] that is used under the [ORGANIZATION] and discussed in section [PERSON] of this final rule. The [ORGANIZATION] dialysis payment rate is adjusted by the wage index for a particular [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility in the same [STREET] that the [ORGANIZATION] base rate is adjusted by the wage index for that facility 81 FR [DATE][DATE][DATE]8. Specifically, we apply the wage index to the labor-related share of the [ORGANIZATION] base rate that we utilize for [ORGANIZATION] dialysis to compute the wage adjusted per-treatment [ORGANIZATION] dialysis payment rate. As stated previously, we are finalizing a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] dialysis payment rate of 25[DATE].90, adjusted by the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilitys wage index. The comments and our responses to the comments on our [ORGANIZATION] dialysis payment proposal are set forth below. Comment Several commenters, including a large dialysis organization and a professional association, commented in support of the proposed update to the [ORGANIZATION] dialysis payment rate for [ORGANIZATION]. They also expressed support for using the same methodology as in [DATE]34 for the [ORGANIZATION] update. A large dialysis organization expressed specific appreciation for the detailed explanation of the [PERSON] process and methodology to develop the [ORGANIZATION] payment amount that has been included in prior rules. This organization noted that [PERSON] has recognized that treatment for [ORGANIZATION] differs from treatment for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. The organization stated that although the services provided to [ORGANIZATION] patients may be the same, their frequency may exceed those typically required by patients with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]. The organization also noted that in the [DATE]32 [ORGANIZATION] final rule, [PERSON] indicated that it planned to make available public use files on utilization of services by [ORGANIZATION] patients once the agency had compiled [DATE]35 of claims. The organization stated that [PERSON] subsequently reported that the agency would continue to monitor utilization trends of items and services furnished to individuals with [ORGANIZATION]. Along with other commenters, the large dialysis organization supports the data collection effort and [PERSON]s commitment to ensure a data-driven approach to developing methodological changes to the [ORGANIZATION]s rate development. The commenters urged [PERSON] to share its monitoring plans to allow the public to better understand the specific data elements that [PERSON] is collecting and analyzing. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the comments in support of the [ORGANIZATION] payment rate update. As the commenter stated, we have been monitoring the trends of [ORGANIZATION] beneficiaries in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities and acute inpatient hemodialysis. This has included quantification of drugs, laboratory tests and other services provided on acute inpatient dialysis claims. We also examine other diagnoses recorded before an acute inpatient dialysis claim. During the [ORGANIZATION] held in [DATE] [ORGANIZATION], we reviewed dialysis-related costs, resource utilization and characteristics of the [ORGANIZATION]-D outpatient dialysis for patients with [ORGANIZATION] population beginning [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]8 when their outpatient dialysis treatment first became eligible under the [ORGANIZATION] claims. That report can be found at the following link As we continue to analyze costs, utilization and patient characteristics, we will also examine data as it relates to an additional site of service for [ORGANIZATION] patients. We will also incorporate additional data monitoring for [ORGANIZATION] patients who have experienced [ORGANIZATION]. The results of the data analysis will be shared in the future in public use files on the [ORGANIZATION] website. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion We are finalizing the [ORGANIZATION] payment rate as proposed, that is, the [ORGANIZATION] payment rate is based on the finalized [ORGANIZATION] base rate. Specifically, the final [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] base rate is 25[DATE].90 Accordingly, we are finalizing a [ORGANIZATION] payment rate of 25[DATE].90 for renal dialysis services furnished by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities to individuals with [ORGANIZATION].I[LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58IP[PERSON] For a detailed discussion of the End-Stage [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Incentive [ORGANIZATION]s [PERSON]s background and history, including a description of the [ORGANIZATION]s authorizing statute and the policies that we have adopted in previous final rules, we refer readers to the following final rules [ORGANIZATION]6 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]5 FR [ZIP], [DATE][DATE] [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]6 FR 628, [DATE][DATE] [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]6 FR [DATE]0[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]548, [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]40 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE][DATE] FR 6[DATE]450, DATE51 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]8 FR [DATE]2156, DATE56 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]9 FR [ZIP], DATE5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 80 FR [ZIP],[PERSON] [ZIP] [DATE]32 [ORGANIZATION] final rule 81 FR [DATE][DATE]834, DATE58 [ORGANIZATION] final rule 82 FR 50[DATE]38, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 83 FR 569[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 84 FR [ZIP], and [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR [DATE]1398.

Extraordinary Circumstances Exception [LOCATION] Previously Granted for [ORGANIZATION] Including Notification of [LOCATION] Due to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [PERSON]58uality Reporting System Issues1. Extraordinary Circumstance Exception [LOCATION] Previously Granted in [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON]0 On [DATE] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54, [ORGANIZATION], in response to [PERSON]0, we announced relief for clinicians, providers, hospitals, and facilities participating in [PERSON] quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs.111 On [DATE] 2[DATE], [ORGANIZATION], we published a supplemental guidance memorandum that described the scope and duration of the [LOCATION]s we were granting under each [PERSON] quality reporting and value-based purchasing [ORGANIZATION] program.112 Each of these [LOCATION]s relieved these providers and facilities of their obligation to report data for [DATE]53 [ORGANIZATION], [DATE]42 and [DATE]49 [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], but we stated that we would score such data if optionally reported.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 111 [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] Announces Relief for Clinicians, Providers, PERSON8spitals and [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]58uality Reporting [ORGANIZATION]s in [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] Mar.

In the ORG136, we updated the [LOCATION] policy for [ORGANIZATION] 85 FR [ZIP] through [ORGANIZATION]0[DATE]. First, we updated our regulations at [ORGANIZATION]. 413.1[DATE]8d[DATE] to state that a facility has opted out of the [LOCATION] for [ORGANIZATION] with respect to the reporting of [DATE]53 [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] data if the facility actually reported the data by the [DATE] [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] deadline but did not notify [PERSON] that it would do so. Additionally, we finalized that facilities would not have the option to opt-out of the [LOCATION] we granted with respect to [DATE]42 and [DATE]49 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] data. We stated that measures calculated using excepted data could affect the national comparability of these data due to the geographic differences of [ORGANIZATION] incidence rates and hospitalizations along with different impacts resulting from different [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] and local law and policy changes implemented in response to [ORGANIZATION], and therefore may not provide a nationally comparable assessment of performance in keeping with the program goal of national comparison. In the [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] ORG136, we welcomed public comments on our policy to update our regulations at [ORGANIZATION]. 413.1[DATE]8d[DATE] to consider a facility as having opted out of the [LOCATION] with respect to [ORGANIZATION] data reported for [DATE]53 [DATE] if the facility actually reported the data by the submission deadline, without notifying [PERSON], and on the exception we finalized to the [LOCATION] opt out policy for [ORGANIZATION] to exclude any [PERSON] data that facilities optionally reported during [DATE]42 and [DATE]49 [ORGANIZATION] from our calculation of [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]s and from the baseline for [DATE]48. The comments we received on these policies and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters supported [PERSON] updated application of the [LOCATION] granted in response to the [PERSON]65 due to [ORGANIZATION]. A few commenters also agreed with [PERSON] concerns regarding the national comparability of data from [DATE]42 and [DATE]49 of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and noted that the integrity and validity of any measurement calculations associated with these data could be compromised. [ORGANIZATION] We thank commenters for their support. Comment A few commenters expressed strong concern that the data collected under [ORGANIZATION] will not adequately reflect the quality of care provided due to the impact of [ORGANIZATION] and the shortened data collection period. A few commenters noted that the data collected under [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] will be limited due to [PERSON]0 and the nationwide [LOCATION] excluding [DATE]42 and [DATE]49 data from consideration, and will undermine the reliability of measure results for scoring purposes. A few commenters recommended that [PERSON] suspend penalties and payment adjustments for the [ORGANIZATION] performance [ORGANIZATION]20, expressing concern that the data collected under [ORGANIZATION] will not adequately reflect the quality of care provided due to the impact of [PERSON]0 and the nationwide [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] We share commenters concerns regarding the potential impact on [PERSON] measure calculations for [DATE] due to [PERSON]0 and the shortened data collection period resulting from the nationwide [LOCATION]. In order to avoid unfairly penalizing facilities based on data that may not accurately reflect the quality of care provided due to circumstances beyond their control, in section I[LOCATION]D of this final rule we are finalizing our proposal to adopt a special scoring and payment policy for [DATE], under which we will not score or apply payment reductions to any [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities for [DATE] under [ORGANIZATION]. Comment A few commenters expressed strong support for extending the [LOCATION] through the end of [ORGANIZATION], noting the continuing impact of [ORGANIZATION] on dialysis facilities. A few commenters also noted that [ORGANIZATION] case rates were higher in [DATE][DATE] and [DATE]53 of [ORGANIZATION] for patients attributed to dialysis facilities in certain geographic regions, and that these higher case rates may have affected performance scores under [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] We agree that the impact of [ORGANIZATION] on dialysis facilities in [ORGANIZATION] has affected our ability to accurately measure their performance. We resumed data collection for [ORGANIZATION] on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] because we believe that collecting [PERSON] measure data is important in order to better understand the impact of [ORGANIZATION] on the data as it relates to factors such as the changing geographic differences in [ORGANIZATION] incidence and the quality of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] care provided to [PERSON] beneficiaries. PERSON8wever, to avoid unfairly penalizing facilities based on data that may not accurately reflect their quality of care, we are finalizing a measure suppression policy for the duration of [PERSON]0 and a special scoring and payment policy for [DATE] in sections I[LOCATION]C and I[LOCATION]D of this final rule. Comment One commenter expressed support for [PERSON] intention to provide subregulatory notice of decisions surrounding payment adjustments and penalties under [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] In the [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] ORG136, we stated that in the interest of time and transparency, we may provide subregulatory advance notice of our intentions regarding payment adjustments and penalties 85 FR [ORGANIZATION]0[DATE]. PERSON8wever, we would like to clarify that we would use rulemaking to propose any actual modifications to [ORGANIZATION] scoring and payment adjustment methodologies and that we[PERSON] 61909are using this final rule to finalize our scoring and payment adjustment policy for [DATE]. Comment One commenter requested that [PERSON] provide further guidance to facilities regarding the criteria for requesting an [LOCATION] during a pandemic. [ORGANIZATION] The criteria for requesting an [LOCATION] under [ORGANIZATION] during a pandemic are the same as the criteria for requesting an [LOCATION] under [ORGANIZATION] due to other extraordinary circumstances beyond a facilitys control. These requirements can be found in our regulations at 42 [ORGANIZATION] 413.1[DATE]8d3 through [DATE]. Under these requirements, a facility may request an [LOCATION] within 90 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s of the extraordinary circumstance occurring and must submit an [LOCATION] request form to [PERSON] with the following information i [ORGANIZATION] CCGPE21 ii [ORGANIZATION] name. iii CEO name and contact information. iv Additional contact name and contact information. v Reason for requesting an exception. vi Dates affected. [PERSON] the facility will start submitting data again, with justification for [DATE]55. viii Evidence of the impact of the extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to photographs, newspaper, and other media articles. In certain circumstances, such as a determination that an extraordinary circumstance has occurred that affects an entire region or locale, [PERSON] may grant exceptions to facilities without a request. We note that facilities may also reject an [LOCATION] granted by [PERSON] under certain circumstances. Technical details can be viewed on the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 website.113--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 113 tab5.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- As established in the [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] ORG136, we have finalized our updated application of the [LOCATION] granted in response to [PERSON]0.2. [LOCATION] Due to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [PERSON]58uality Reporting System [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 Issues On [DATE], [ORGANIZATION],114 we launched the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [PERSON]58uality Reporting System E[PERSON]58RGPE13 The [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 contains the functionalities of the following three legacy [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Systems in one global application 1 A quality measure and [ORGANIZATION] performance score review system [PERSON] System 2 an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patient registry and quality measure reporting system through [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1-enabled Network [PERSON]5 and 3 [PERSON] coverage determination support through [ORGANIZATION] REMIGPE13 The transition to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 supports our efforts to consolidate the functionalities of the [PERSON]5, [PERSON] System, and [ORGANIZATION] applications into a single system, and aims to provide ongoing support to the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] user community to foster accurate and timely [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]01 data submission. This migration eliminates the need for multiple user accounts, and will in the long-term also improve the overall user experience and reduce burden due to enhanced navigation features.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 114 In order to access [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, all authorized users must create an account with the Health Care [PERSON]58uality Information Systems [PERSON]56ERSON158IS Access Roles and [ORGANIZATION], known as HARP, which is a secure identity management portal provided by [PERSON]. Previously, users created separate accounts for each [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] application through [PERSON] Enterprise Identity Data Management EIDM system. Creating an account via HARP provides users with a user ID and password that can be used to access many [PERSON] applications. It also provides a single location for users to modify their profile, change their password, update their challenge question, and add or remove two-factor authentication devices. Users can register for a HARP account by going to the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 HARP Registration page, available at We stated in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP] that since the launch of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, several critical data submission issues had been identified that impact the overall quality and accuracy of data available to support the implementation of [ORGANIZATION], and we suspended all clinical data submissions into [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 to allow time to resolve the issue.115 Based on our assessment, the data submission issues only impacted [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]8 and data submitted for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Network quality improvement activities. In the proposed rule, we noted that we had analyzed the data submission issues and stated our belief that the data systems issues would be resolved on or about [DATE]2, [ORGANIZATION]8.116--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 115 116 On DATE[DATE]1, we announced that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 data suspension will be concluded as of [DATE]2, [ORGANIZATION]8, and that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 testing had been performed to ensure that the system is working as expected. We recognized that these operational systems issues would prevent facilities from submitting [PERSON] clinical data until the data systems issues were resolved. Therefore, we announced a blanket extension of remaining [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] clinical reporting deadlines [DATE] FR [ZIP] through [DATE]. Under this extension, facilities would have until [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]29, [ORGANIZATION]8 to submit [DATE] through [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] clinical data. In the proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], we stated our belief that this reporting extension aligned with the time estimated for resolution of our operational systems issues and would give dialysis facilities nearly [DATE] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE]3 to submit their data to E[PERSON]58RGPE13 We stated that we would provide further details to facilities when the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 issues were resolved, as well as when facilities could begin submitting their data for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]5, through routine communication channels to facilities, vendors, [PERSON]58uality Improvement Organizations [PERSON]58IOs and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Networks. We stated that the communications could include memos, emails, and notices on the public [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 website  As this situation was ongoing at the time, we stated in the proposed rule that we would announce any relevant extension deadlines and data submission requirements for impacted [ORGANIZATION]5 data through the routine communication channels discussed above. On [DATE] 3, [ORGANIZATION]8, we announced that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]29, [ORGANIZATION]8 data submission deadline for [DATE]-[DATE] [ORGANIZATION] clinical data had been extended to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]295, [ORGANIZATION]8 in order to give facilities additional time to submit their data.11[DATE]--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11[DATE] We also have provided additional information at Because the current data submissions issue would not be resolved until or about [DATE]2, [ORGANIZATION]8 and had impacted all facilities that participate in [PERSON], we stated our belief that granting a blanket [LOCATION] to all facilities without a request under 42 [ORGANIZATION] 413.1[DATE]8d6ii was the appropriate remedy under these circumstances. We also stated our belief that requiring facilities to report the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] data impacted by this [LOCATION] by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]29, [ORGANIZATION]8 was reasonable. In our data suspension announcements, we noted that facilities were expected to continue to use [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 to collect clinical data to complete tasks such as admit and discharge patients, complete [PERSON][PERSON] 61910forms such as the [PERSON]-2[DATE]28 End Stage [ORGANIZATION] Medical Evidence Report [PERSON] Entitlement andor [PERSON], [PERSON]-2[DATE]44 End Stage [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION] Survey Form, and [PERSON]-2[DATE]46 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Death Notification, add or update treatment summaries, resolve notifications within a timely manner, and should also continue to keep facilities information up-to-date.118 In other words, although facilities were unable to submit clinical data through [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, facilities were advised that they must continue to collect the clinical data.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 118 In the proposed rule [DATE] FR [DATE], we stated that while we were working to resolve all known systems issues by [DATE]2, [ORGANIZATION]8 and reopen submissions so that facilities may submit their [DATE] through [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] data no later than [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]29, [ORGANIZATION]8, we would only be able to ensure the validity of the impacted data after they are submitted. Given that the system issues experienced during the initial implementation of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, if not fully resolved, could potentially impact the accuracy and reliability of the data reported, we were concerned that facilities may be unfairly penalized because the current systems issues may impact the quality of the data. The [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 system issues had resulted in multiple or incorrect dates of patient admissions andor discharges, as well as showing duplicate patient records. Facilities had also expressed concerns about their experience with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 issues, noting that there was no [STREET] for a facility to verify accuracy or completeness. They had reported issues including missing record status in response files, which meant that facilities did not know if the records were accepted or received an error response, and issues with determining whether clinical data were accepted because the information did not show in the user interface or the reports that facilities were receiving from E[PERSON]58RGPE13 We stated in the proposed rule that we recognized stakeholders concerns about the potential impact to the quality of data for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. We stated our belief that the observed system issues, and any unresolved issues that may be identified only after data submissions are resumed, could impact the quality and accuracy of the data needed to calculate accurate [PERSON] scores used for [DATE] [PERSON] calculations because patient admittance dates, discharge dates, record status in response files, clinical data, and the number of active patient cases are data points that are included in measure calculations for all of the [DATE] [PERSON] measures. If these data points were incorrect, then this would impact our ability to accurately calculate measures and would distort a facilitys measure performance. Therefore, because of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 system issues described above, and additionally, due to the impact of [PERSON]0 on some of the [DATE] [PERSON] measures, as described more fully in section I[LOCATION]C of this final rule, we proposed to not score or award a [ORGANIZATION] to any facility, or reduce payment to any facility, in [DATE]. As discussed more fully in section I[LOCATION]D below, we are finalizing that proposal in this final rule. Although we considered if there may be any alternative data sources for the measures impacted by these [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 system issues, we concluded that this was not feasible for several reasons. First, all 14 [PERSON] measures for [DATE] were impacted by these system issues. Although certain measures do not require that facilities submit clinical data into [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, we use [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 data to determine whether a facility has treated a sufficient number of patients in order to meet the measures minimum patient case threshold necessary to calculate the measure for [PERSON]. For example, the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] Bloodstream Infection [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure requires that facilities report data to NHSGPE21 PERSON8wever, the measure also has a requirement to exclude facilities that do not treat at least 11 eligible in-center hemodialysis patients during the [DATE]5 performance period. In order to determine whether a facility has treated at least 11 eligible patients, we use [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 admission data and [PERSON] claims data in order to determine whether the facility is eligible to receive a score on the measure.119--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 119 We ultimately decided to propose the special rule for [DATE], as described further, because not only do these system issues impact all [PERSON] measures, which could lead to distorted performance scores and unfair penalties, but we also wanted to provide facilities with the business certainty they need regarding their [DATE] payments. In order to determine whether all data quality issues have been resolved when [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 reopens for data submissions, we stated that we would need time to validate the impacted data after facilities are able to resume data submission. Due to the timing of this reporting extension, we stated our belief that there were no feasible alternative data sources for [DATE]. Therefore, we stated that the scoring and payment modifications we proposed for [DATE] were appropriate in this situation. Comment Several commenters expressed appreciation and support for the reporting extension granted due to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 issues. A few commenters noted that facilities have experienced challenges with reporting data to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 and that the extension is helpful particularly as facilities continue to also address the impact of [PERSON]0. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support. Comment A few commenters requested that [PERSON] extend the reporting extension to the end of [ORGANIZATION]5, noting the ongoing [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]65 and continued challenges with data reporting. One commenter expressed the belief that extending the reporting deadline to the end of [ORGANIZATION]5 will help to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data submitted. One commenter expressed concern that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 issues may not be fully resolved by the anticipated deadline, and requested that [PERSON] issue further flexibilities if necessary. [ORGANIZATION] Although we initially extended the data submission deadline to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]29, [ORGANIZATION]8, we subsequently extended that deadline to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]295, [ORGANIZATION]8 in order to give facilities additional time to submit their data. We note that all outstanding [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 issues have been resolved and we reopened access to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 on [DATE]2, [ORGANIZATION]8. We believe that 2 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 was sufficient time for facilities to report [DATE] through [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] data. Comment A few commenters expressed support for the issuance of notifications through routine communication channels, in the event that an additional extension is granted due to unresolved [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 issues. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support.[PERSON] for [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON]01. Adoption of a Measure Suppression Policy for the Duration of [PERSON]0 In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, we stated that in previous rules, we have identified the need for flexibility in our quality measurement programs to account for changing conditions that are beyond participating facilities or practitioners control. We identified this need because we would like to ensure that participants in our[PERSON] 61911programs are not affected negatively when their quality performance suffers for reasons not due to the care provided, but instead due to external factors. A significant example of the type of external factor that may affect quality measurement is [PERSON]0, which has had, and continues to have, significant and ongoing effects on the provision of medical care in the country and around the world. The [ORGANIZATION] pandemic and associated [PERSON]65 have impeded effective quality measurement in many ways. PERSON4ges to clinical practices to accommodate safety protocols for medical personnel and patients, as well as unpredicted changes in the number of stays and facility-level case mixes, have affected the data used in quality measurement and the resulting quality scores. Measures used in [ORGANIZATION] need to be evaluated to determine whether their specifications need to be updated to account for new clinical guidelines, diagnosis or procedure codes, and medication changes that we have observed during the [PERSON]65. Additionally, because [ORGANIZATION] prevalence is not consistent across the country, dialysis facilities located in different areas have been affected differently at different times throughout the pandemic. Under those circumstances, we stated in the proposed rule that we remain significantly concerned that [ORGANIZATION]s quality measure scores that are calculated using data submitted during the [PERSON]65 for [ORGANIZATION] will be distorted and will result in skewed payment incentives and inequitable payments, particularly for dialysis facilities that have treated more [ORGANIZATION] patients than others. We further stated that it is not our intention to penalize dialysis facilities based on measure scores that we believe are distorted by the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic and, thus, not reflective of the quality of care that the measures in [ORGANIZATION] were designed to assess. As previously discussed, the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic has had, and continues to have, significant and enduring effects on health care systems around the world, and affects care decisions, including those made on clinical topics covered by [ORGANIZATION]s measures. As a result of [PERSON]0, dialysis facilities could provide care to their patients that meets the underlying clinical standard but results in worse measured performance, and by extension, payment penalties in [ORGANIZATION]. We also stated that we are concerned that regional differences in [ORGANIZATION] prevalence during the performance period for [DATE] have directly affected dialysis facilities measure scores on [ORGANIZATION] for [DATE]. Although these regional differences in [ORGANIZATION] prevalence rates do not reflect differences in the quality of care furnished by dialysis facilities, they could directly affect the payment penalties that these facilities could receive and could result in an unfair and inequitable distribution of those penalties. These inequities could be especially pronounced for dialysis facilities that have treated a large number of [ORGANIZATION] patients. We therefore proposed to adopt a policy for the duration of [PERSON]0 that would enable us to suppress the use of [PERSON] measure data for all facilities if we determine that circumstances caused by [PERSON]0 have affected those measures and the resulting total performance scores [ORGANIZATION]s significantly [DATE] FR [ZIP]. We also proposed to suppress certain measures for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20 because we have determined that circumstances caused by [PERSON]0 have affected those measures significantly. In addition, due to both the impacts of [PERSON]0 on certain measures and the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 system issues described in section I[LOCATION]B.2 we proposed to adopt a special scoring and payment rule for [DATE], as described more fully in section I[LOCATION]D In developing the proposed policy, we considered what circumstances caused by [PERSON]0 would affect a quality measure significantly enough to warrant its suppression in a value-based purchasing [ORGANIZATION] program. We stated our belief that a significant deviation in measured performance that can be reasonably attributed to [PERSON]0 is a significant indicator of changes in clinical conditions that affect quality measurement. Similarly, we stated our belief that a measure may be focused on a clinical topic or subject that is proximal to the disease, pathogen, or other health impacts of the [PERSON]65. As has been the case during the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic, we stated our belief that rapid or unprecedented changes in clinical guidelines and care delivery, potentially including appropriate treatments, drugs, or other protocols may affect quality measurement significantly and should not be attributed to the participating facility positively or negatively. We also noted that scientific understanding of a particular disease or pathogen may evolve quickly during an emergency, especially in cases of new disease or conditions. Finally, we stated our belief that, as evidenced during the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic, national or regional shortages or changes in health care personnel, medical supplies, equipment, diagnostic tools, and patient case volumes or case mix may result in significant distortions to quality measurement. Based on these considerations, we developed a number of [ORGANIZATION] that we believe should guide our determination of whether to propose to suppress [PERSON] measures for [DATE]9 that overlap with [PERSON]0. We proposed to adopt these [ORGANIZATION] for use in [ORGANIZATION] and, for consistency, the following other [ORGANIZATION] programs PERSON8spital [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], PERSON8spital Readmissions Reduction [ORGANIZATION], PERSON8spital-Acquired Condition HAC Reduction [ORGANIZATION], and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION][DATE] see, for example, [DATE] FR [ZIP] through [ZIP], [DATE] through [DATE], and [DATE] through [ZIP]. We stated our belief that these [ORGANIZATION] will help us evaluate measures in [ORGANIZATION] and that their adoption in the other [ORGANIZATION] programs noted previously will help ensure consistency in our measure evaluations across programs. The proposed [ORGANIZATION] are as follows Factor 1 Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during [PERSON]0, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0. Factor 2 Clinical proximity of the measures focus to the relevant disease, pathogen, or health impacts of [PERSON]0. Factor 3 Rapid or unprecedented changes in  Clinical guidelines, care delivery or practice, treatments, drugs, or related protocols, or equipment or diagnostic tools or materials or  the generally accepted scientific understanding of the nature or biological pathway of the disease or pathogen, particularly for a novel disease or pathogen of unknown origin. Factor [PERSON] national shortages or rapid or unprecedented changes in  [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]8 personnel  medical supplies, equipment, or diagnostic tools or materials or  patient case volumes or facility-level case mix. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, we also considered alternatives to this proposed policy that could fulfill our objective to not penalize dialysis facilities for measure results that are distorted due to [PERSON]0. As previously noted, the country continues to grapple with the effects of the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic, and in [DATE][PERSON] [ZIP][ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] issued a nationwide, blanket Extraordinary Circumstances Exception [LOCATION] for all hospitals and other facilities participating in our quality reporting and [ORGANIZATION] programs in response to [PERSON]0. This blanket [LOCATION] excepted all data reporting requirements for [DATE]42 and [DATE]49 [ORGANIZATION] data, including claims data and data collected through the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]9 web-based surveillance system for this data period, and quality data collection resumed on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]. For claims-based measures, we also stated that we would exclude all qualifying [DATE]42 and [DATE]49 [ORGANIZATION] claims from our measure calculations. We considered extending this blanket [LOCATION] that we issued for [DATE]42 and [DATE]49 [ORGANIZATION] to also include [DATE][DATE] and [DATE]53 [ORGANIZATION]. This alternative would have protected providers and suppliers from having their quality data used for quality scoring purposes if those data were likely to have been affected significantly by [PERSON]0. PERSON8wever, this option would have made quality data collection and reporting to [PERSON] no longer mandatory and would have left us with no comprehensive data available to provide confidential performance feedback to providers nor for monitoring and to inform decision-making for potential future programmatic changes, particularly as the [PERSON]65 is extended. As an alternative to the proposed quality measure suppression policy, we also considered not suppressing any measures under [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON8wever, this alternative would mean assessing dialysis facilities using quality measure data that has been significantly affected by the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic. Additionally, given the geographic disparities in the [ORGANIZATION] pandemics effects, we stated in the proposed rule that implementation of the [DATE] [PERSON] as previously finalized would [STREET] dialysis facilities in regions that were more heavily impacted by the pandemic in [DATE][DATE] and [DATE]53 of [ORGANIZATION] at a disadvantage compared to facilities in regions that were more heavily impacted during [DATE][DATE]5 for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] FR [ZIP] through [DATE][DATE]6. We stated in the proposed rule that we viewed this measure suppression proposal as a necessity to ensure that [ORGANIZATION] does not penalize facilities based on external factors that were beyond the control of facilities. We intended for this proposed policy to provide short-term relief to dialysis facilities when we have determined that one or more of the [ORGANIZATION] warrants the suppression of an [PERSON] measure. We welcomed public comments on this proposal for the adoption of a measure suppression policy for the duration of [PERSON]0, and also on the proposed [ORGANIZATION] that we developed for purposes of this proposed policy. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Many commenters expressed support for the measure suppression policy for the duration of [PERSON]0. Several commenters expressed appreciation that the proposed measure suppression policy would help to address the ongoing challenges of [PERSON]0. Several commenters expressed support for the proposed measure suppression policy, noting that measure scores may be distorted due to the substantial impact of [PERSON]0 on facility performance and that such a policy would help to avoid penalizing facilities based on potentially distorted data due to [PERSON]0. [ORGANIZATION] We thank commenters for their support. Comment One commenter acknowledged the benefit of the proposed measure suppression policy, but also expressed concern regarding the exclusion of data showing the high morbidity and mortality of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients with [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] Although we will not score facilities using data submitted during the [LOCATION], we do intend to make individual facility data that was reported available to that facility so that the facility has an opportunity assess the impact of [ORGANIZATION] on its [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients. We will also publicly report the measure rates with appropriate caveats. We believe that providing as much information as possible to facilities in this [STREET] while also publicly reporting performance data to the public with appropriate caveats balances fairness in our value-based purchasing programs with the publics need for transparency. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposals to address the negative impact of the pandemic on [ORGANIZATION] and recommended that [PERSON] consider similar considerations for [ORGANIZATION]5 measure data. A few commenters strongly recommended that [PERSON] consider extending relief under [ORGANIZATION] to [DATE]48, citing the rise of the [LOCATION] variant and continuing impact of [ORGANIZATION] on facilities as well as the [ORGANIZATION] system nationwide. These commenters noted the continuing impact of the [PERSON]65 on [PERSON] measures, due both to the impact of [ORGANIZATION] on [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients which may result in new hospital admissions and impact facility performance on [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] measures, as well as the strain on the [ORGANIZATION] system due to the influx of [ORGANIZATION] patients which may impact the availability of vascular access procedures and transplant evaluations. A few commenters noted that geographic variations in [PERSON]0 during [ORGANIZATION]5 continue to exacerbate distortions in [PERSON] measure performance. [ORGANIZATION] The measure suppression policy that we are finalizing in this final rule applies for the duration of [PERSON]0. We will continue to monitor the impact of [PERSON]0 on dialysis facilities, and we would consider proposing in a future rulemaking to suppress one or more individual [PERSON] measures for a future [PERSON] payment [ORGANIZATION]20 if we conclude that circumstances caused by [PERSON]0 have affected those measures and the resulting [ORGANIZATION]s based on [ORGANIZATION]5 data. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposed [ORGANIZATION]. Several commenters noted that they will help to mitigate the negative impact of the challenges presented by [PERSON]0 such as significant deviation in national performance, the distorting impact on measures themselves, changing guidelines and protocols related to the [PERSON]65, and challenges due to shortages in both medical supplies, staffing, and patient volume and case-mix on quality measures. One commenter expressed support for the proposed [ORGANIZATION], noting that they will help to ensure consistency in measure evaluation and suppression. [ORGANIZATION] We thank commenters for their support. Comment A few commenters expressed concern regarding the proposed [ORGANIZATION]. One commenter expressed concern that proposed [ORGANIZATION] 2 may overlook indirect or downstream clinical impacts that may not be considered proximate, noting for example the impact of [PERSON]0 shutdown on non-urgent scheduled vascular placement procedures leading to reduced catheter insertions and fistula rates as well as a delay in patient follow up regarding such procedures due to patient fears of [ORGANIZATION] exposure. One commenter expressed concern that proposed [ORGANIZATION] 4 does not sufficiently address regional or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]-by-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] impacts on personnel, patient volumes or case-mix, and medical[PERSON] 61913supplies or equipment, and recommended that [PERSON] broaden application of its scope to include sub-national, regional, and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] impacts. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] consider under [ORGANIZATION] 4 the impact of [ORGANIZATION] personnel shortages on [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities as a result of [PERSON]0. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] consider including under [ORGANIZATION] 4 circumstances where there is a statistically meaningful lower denominator from [DATE][DATE][DATE] due to factors outside of a facilitys control, such as changes in demographics. [ORGANIZATION] We developed the [ORGANIZATION] based on several considerations specifically related to the [PERSON]65 for [ORGANIZATION], including national, regional, and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] impacts. For example, we note that [ORGANIZATION] 4 addresses [ORGANIZATION] shortages in personnel as well as patient volumes and facility-level case mix. We believe the [ORGANIZATION] we are adopting for [PERSON]0 are sufficient to guide us in identifying whether circumstances caused by [PERSON]0 have affected [PERSON] measures and the resulting [ORGANIZATION]s. Comment One commenter recommended adding an additional measure suppression factor to suppress a measure in cases where the measure denominator is statistically meaningfully lower due to circumstances beyond the facilitys control such as [ORGANIZATION] mortality, noting that this may significantly also impact measure performance. [ORGANIZATION] We believe that the commenters suggestion would be captured by the proposed [ORGANIZATION] 4. As we discussed in the proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], we developed these suppression factors to assess changing conditions due to [PERSON]0 and proposed them consistently in several of our value-based purchasing programs. As we stated above, we believe the [ORGANIZATION] we are adopting for [PERSON]0 are sufficient to guide us in identifying whether circumstances caused by [PERSON]0 have affected [PERSON] measures and the resulting [ORGANIZATION]s. Comment A few commenters expressed support for the proposal to provide confidential feedback reports to dialysis facilities under the proposed measure suppression policy, noting that it will allow facilities to focus on performance improvement and also allow [PERSON] to track developments in the field. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support and note that we are finalizing this proposal in this final rule. Comment One commenter expressed support for the public reporting of performance scores from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] with appropriate caveats. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenter for its support. Comment A few commenters did not support the public reporting of suppressed measures, noting reliability concerns due to the impact of [PERSON]0 on measure data. [ORGANIZATION] We believe it is important to balance fairness with the publics need for transparency. Therefore, we intend to make the data publicly available. In order to address concerns about publicly reporting data that was collected by facilities during [PERSON]0, we will appropriately caveat the publicly displayed data for suppressed measures to note that the measures have been suppressed for purposes of scoring and payment adjustments because of the effects of [PERSON]0. We believe these caveats will mitigate any public confusion that could otherwise result from the display. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to adopt a measure suppression policy for the duration of [PERSON]0. We are also finalizing the proposed [ORGANIZATION] that we proposed for purposes of this measure suppression policy. We will also publicly report the data with appropriate caveats.2. Suppression of Four [PERSON] Measures for [DATE]a. [LOCATION] In response to the [PERSON]65 for [ORGANIZATION], we conducted analyses of the 14 current [PERSON] measures to determine whether and how [ORGANIZATION] may have impacted the validity of these measures. For the reasons discussed in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, we concluded that [ORGANIZATION] has so severely impacted the validity of four measures that we believe we cannot fairly and equitably score these measures for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20. Accordingly, we proposed to suppress these measures for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20 for all [PERSON] participants [DATE] FR [DATE][DATE]6. Specifically, the measures we proposed to suppress for the [DATE] [PERSON] are as follows [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure under [ORGANIZATION] 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during [PERSON]0, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0 and [ORGANIZATION] 4, Significant national shortages or rapid or unprecedented changes in  [ORGANIZATION] personnel  medical supplies, equipment, or diagnostic tools or materials or  patient case volumes or facility-level case mix Standardized Readmission Ratio [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure under [ORGANIZATION] 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during [PERSON]0, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0 and [ORGANIZATION] 4, Significant national shortages or rapid or unprecedented changes in  [ORGANIZATION] personnel  medical supplies, equipment, or diagnostic tools or materials or  patient case volumes or facility-level case mix ORG81 [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] Survey Administration clinical measure under [ORGANIZATION] 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during [PERSON]0, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0 and [ORGANIZATION]ong-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure under [ORGANIZATION] 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during [PERSON]0, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0. We received comments on additional measures that we should consider suppressing and address them below. Comment Several commenters recommended that we suppress [ORGANIZATION] measure. A few commenters noted that [ORGANIZATION] measure and [ORGANIZATION] measure are both [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Vascular Access measures, but only [ORGANIZATION] measure is proposed for suppression. A few commenters noted that [ORGANIZATION] fistula placements may have been delayed because it was not clear whether such procedures were considered an elective surgery in the beginning of the [PERSON]65 and also because[PERSON] [ZIP][[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients may have delayed or avoided medical treatments because of [ORGANIZATION] concerns. Several commenters recommended that [PERSON] suppress the Percentage of Prevalent [PERSON]s Waitlisted [ORGANIZATION] measure, noting that [PERSON]0 had a significant negative impact on transplant surgeries, referrals and waitlists, as well as other related areas. A few commenters also noted that waitlist additions significantly decreased during [PERSON]0. A few commenters recommended that [PERSON] consider suppressing the [PERSON]56tV [ORGANIZATION] measure, noting that the impact of [PERSON]0 on catheter rates has a corresponding impact on the [PERSON]56tV measure, as patients with catheters will have lower [PERSON]56tV rates. One commenter recommended suppressing the [PERSON]56tV [ORGANIZATION] measure under proposed [ORGANIZATION] 1, due to significant deviation in national measure performance. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] suppress the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure under [ORGANIZATION] 3 and Factor 4, noting that challenges in care delivery and treatment related to catheter removal and [ORGANIZATION]F insertion resulted in an increased likelihood of patient infection, as well as an increase in patient volume and case-mix due to [ORGANIZATION] patients developing [ORGANIZATION] and requiring catheterization. [ORGANIZATION] At the time of the proposed rule, there was not sufficient data to determine whether suppression was appropriate for [ORGANIZATION] measure, the [ORGANIZATION] measure, the [PERSON]56tV [ORGANIZATION] measure, or the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. We note that the status of the data remains unchanged since the proposed rule was published. Although we agree with commenters that performance on [ORGANIZATION] measure is linked to measure performance on [ORGANIZATION] measure, the data that was available at the time of the proposed rule indicated that [PERSON]0 had a comparatively lower impact on [ORGANIZATION] measure. For the [ORGANIZATION] measure, our analysis of the relevant data available at the time of the proposed rule indicated temporal declines in waitlist removal among prevalent patients and similarly a decline in waitlisting and transplants in incident [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients in [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] through May [ORGANIZATION] compared to [DATE][DATE][DATE]. PERSON8wever, we also observed that trends generally returned to normal starting in [PERSON]95une and [PERSON]95uly [ORGANIZATION] and reflected data similar to [DATE][DATE][DATE]. Although performance on the [PERSON]56tV [ORGANIZATION] measure deviated temporarily, our analysis indicated that [PERSON]56tV rates stabilized shortly thereafter and reflect measure performance similar to [DATE][DATE][DATE]. Based on our analysis, [PERSON]56tV rates in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] were similar to rates in [ORGANIZATION] until [DATE]84, where they dropped by an average of 0.4 percent. PERSON8wever, beginning in [PERSON]95une [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]56tV rates were the same as or higher than national average rates in [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]. We were unable to assess the impact of [PERSON]0 on the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure, which requires a full 12 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 of data in order to calculate measure performance. The [PERSON]1 will not be able to calculate measure performance for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure because the nationwide [LOCATION] granted in response to [PERSON]0 excepted data from [DATE]42 and [DATE]49 of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. As a result, facilities will not receive scores for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. We also note that suppressing the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure would be unlikely under [ORGANIZATION] 3 and Factor 4, as the links between those factors and the impacts on measure performance cited by the commenter are not sufficiently direct. Although challenges in care delivery and treatment related to catheter removal and [ORGANIZATION]F insertion resulted in an increased likelihood of patient infection, as well as an increase in patient volume and case-mix due to [ORGANIZATION] patients developing [ORGANIZATION] and requiring catheterization, neither of those directly caused patients to develop more bloodstream infections as a result of [PERSON]0. PERSON8wever, we will continue to monitor and review the data and consider proposing in a future rulemaking to suppress one or more individual [PERSON] measures for a future [PERSON] payment [ORGANIZATION]20 if we conclude that circumstances caused by [PERSON]0 have affected those measures and the resulting [ORGANIZATION]s based on [ORGANIZATION]5 data.b. Suppression of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for [DATE] In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [DATE][DATE]6 through 363[DATE], we proposed to suppress the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20 under proposed [ORGANIZATION] 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during [PERSON]0, which could be significantly better or significantly worse as compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0. The [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure is an all-cause, risk-standardized rate of hospitalizations during a [DATE]88 observation window. The standardized hospitalization ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of hospital admissions that occur for [PERSON] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] dialysis patients treated at a particular facility to the number of hospitalizations that would be expected given the characteristics of the dialysis facilitys patients and the national norm for dialysis facilities. This measure is calculated as a ratio but can also be expressed as a rate. The intent of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure is to improve health care delivery and care coordination to help reduce unplanned hospitalization among [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients. Based on our analysis of [PERSON] dialysis patient data from [PERSON]95anuary [ORGANIZATION] through [DATE] [ORGANIZATION], we found that hospitalizations involving patients diagnosed with [ORGANIZATION] resulted in higher mortality rates, higher rates of discharge to hospice or skilled nursing facilities, and lower rates of discharge to home than hospitalizations involving patients who were not diagnosed with [ORGANIZATION]. Specifically, the hospitalization rate for [PERSON] dialysis patients diagnosed with [ORGANIZATION] was more than [DATE] times greater than the hospitalization rate during the same period for [PERSON] dialysis patients who were not diagnosed with [ORGANIZATION], which is much greater than the relative risk of hospitalization for any other comorbidity. In the proposed rule [DATE] FR [DATE][DATE]6, we stated that this indicates that [ORGANIZATION] has had a significant impact on the hospitalization rate for dialysis patients. Because [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] dialysis patients are at significantly greater risk of hospitalization, and the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure was not developed to account for the impact of [ORGANIZATION] on this patient population, we expressed our concern about the effects of the observed [ORGANIZATION] hospitalizations on the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. We also noted that [ORGANIZATION] affected different regions of the country at different rates depending on factors like time of [ORGANIZATION]20, geographic density, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] and local policies, and health care system capacity. Because of the increased hospitalization risk associated with [ORGANIZATION] and the [PERSON] dialysis patient population, we expressed our concern that these regional differences in [ORGANIZATION] rates have led to distorted hospitalization rates such that we could not reliably measure national performance on the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. Our analysis of the available [PERSON] claims data indicated that [PERSON]0 has had significant effects on hospital admissions of dialysis patients,[PERSON] 61915and would result in significant deviation in national performance on the measure during [PERSON]0 which could be significantly worse as compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0. Not only are there effects on patients diagnosed with [ORGANIZATION], but the presence of the virus strongly affected hospital admission patterns of dialysis patients from [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON]95une [ORGANIZATION], and we expressed our concern that similar effects would be seen in the balance of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28 [ORGANIZATION] as the [PERSON]65 continued. Because the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic swept through geographic regions of the country unevenly, we expressed our concern that dialysis facilities in different regions of the country would have been affected differently throughout the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]20, thereby skewing measure performance and affecting national comparability due to significant and unprecedented changes in patient case volumes or facility-level case mix. Given the limitations of the data available to us for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], we stated our belief the resulting performance measurement on the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure would not be sufficiently reliable or valid for use in [ORGANIZATION]. We proposed to suppress this measure for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20, rather than remove it, because we believe that the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure is an important part of [ORGANIZATION] measure set. PERSON8wever, we were concerned that [PERSON]0 affected measure performance on the current [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure such that we would not be able to score facilities fairly or equitably on it. Additionally, we stated that we would continue to collect the measures claims data from participating facilities so that we could monitor the effect of the circumstances on quality measurement and determine the appropriate policies in the future. We would also continue to provide confidential feedback reports to facilities as part of program activities to ensure that they are made aware of the changes in performance rates that we observe. We also stated our intent to publicly report [DATE] data where feasible and appropriately caveated. In the proposed rule, we stated that we were currently exploring ways to adjust effectively for the systematic effects of [PERSON]0 on hospital admissions for the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. PERSON8wever, we are still working to improve these [ORGANIZATION] adjustments and verify the validity of a potential modified version of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure as additional data become available. As an alternative, we considered whether we could exclude patients with a diagnosis of [ORGANIZATION] from the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure cohort, but we determined suppression will provide us with additional time and additional [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 of data potentially impacted by [ORGANIZATION] to more thoroughly evaluate a broader range of alternatives. We want to ensure that the measure reflects care provided to [PERSON] dialysis patients and we are concerned that excluding otherwise eligible patients may not accurately reflect the care provided, particularly given the unequal distribution of [ORGANIZATION] patients across facilities and hospitals over time. As an alternative approach, we stated that we also might consider updating the specifications for the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure to eliminate any exposure time and events after infection for patients who contract [ORGANIZATION], as [ORGANIZATION] symptoms may continue to affect patients after infection. We stated our belief that this approach might help distinguish between [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]-related hospitalizations and [ORGANIZATION] related hospitalizations that might otherwise impact [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure calculations. We welcomed public comment on our proposal to suppress the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for [DATE]. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposal to suppress the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for [DATE], agreeing that [PERSON]0 has impacted the validity and reliability of performance scoring for [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to suppress the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for [DATE].c. Suppression of the [ORGANIZATION] Clinical Measure for [DATE] In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 363[DATE] through [ZIP], we proposed to suppress the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20 under proposed [ORGANIZATION] 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during [PERSON]0, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0. The [ORGANIZATION] assesses the number of readmission events for the patients at a facility, relative to the number of readmission events that would be expected based on overall national rates and the characteristics of the patients at that facility as well as the number of discharges. The intent of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure is to improve care coordination between dialysis facilities and hospitals to improve communication prior to and post discharge. Based on our analysis, we found that index discharge hospitalizations involving dialysis patients diagnosed with [ORGANIZATION] resulted in lower readmissions and higher mortality rates within the first [DATE] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s. We used index hospitalizations occurring from [PERSON]95anuary 1, [ORGANIZATION] through [PERSON]95une 30, [ORGANIZATION] to identify eligible index hospitalizations and unplanned hospital readmissions. In an analysis of unadjusted readmission and death rates by [ORGANIZATION] hospitalization status and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s since index discharge, during [DATE] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s after discharge there was a readmission rate of 81.3 percent of dialysis patients hospitalized with [ORGANIZATION], as compared to 82.6 percent of dialysis patients hospitalized without [ORGANIZATION]. During that same 4 to [DATE] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19 time period, the unadjusted mortality rate for dialysis patients hospitalized with [ORGANIZATION] was 16.9 percent, compared with 10.9 percent of patients hospitalized without [ORGANIZATION]. Based on this discrepancy, we were concerned about the effects of these observations on the calculations for the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. The denominator of [ORGANIZATION] reflects the expected number of index discharges followed by an unplanned readmission within 4 to 30 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s in each facility, which is derived from a model that accounts for patient characteristics, the dialysis facility to which the patient is discharged, and the discharging acute care or critical access hospitals involved. Our analysis indicated potential competing risks of higher mortality and lower readmissions due to patient death or discharge to hospice, both of which would remove them from the denominator for the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. If readmissions rates are lower because patient mortality is higher due to the impact of [ORGANIZATION] on dialysis patients, then readmission rates would be distorted by appearing significantly better compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0. Based on the impact of [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION] results, including the deviance in measurement, we concluded that the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure met our criteria for Factor 1 where performance data would significantly deviate from historical data performance and would be considered unreliable. Therefore, we stated our belief that the resulting performance measurement on the [ORGANIZATION] clinical[PERSON] 61916measure would not be sufficiently reliable or valid for use in [ORGANIZATION]. We proposed to suppress this measure for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20, rather than remove it, because we believe that the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure is an important part of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] measure set. PERSON8wever, we were concerned that the [PERSON]65 for the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic affected measure performance on the current [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure such that we would not be able to score facilities fairly or equitably on it. Additionally, we stated that we would continue to collect the measures claims data from participating facilities so that we could monitor the effect of the circumstances on quality measurement and determine the appropriate policies in the future. We would also continue to provide confidential feedback reports to facilities as part of program activities to ensure that they are made aware of the changes in performance rates that we observe. We also stated our intent to publicly report [DATE] data where feasible and appropriately caveated. In the proposed rule, we stated that we were currently exploring ways to adjust effectively for the systematic effects of [PERSON]0 on hospital admissions for the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. PERSON8wever, we are still working to improve these [ORGANIZATION] adjustments and verify the validity of a potential modified version of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure as additional data becomes available. As an alternative approach, we stated that we might also consider eliminating from the calculation of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure any cases of patients who had a [ORGANIZATION] event prior to or at the time of index hospitalization. We stated our belief this approach might help distinguish between [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]-related readmissions and [ORGANIZATION] related readmissions that might otherwise impact [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure calculations. We welcomed public comment on our proposal to suppress the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for [DATE]. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposal to suppress the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for [DATE], agreeing that [PERSON]0 has impacted the validity and reliability of performance scoring for [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to suppress the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for [DATE].d. Suppression of the [PERSON]4 Clinical Measure for [DATE] In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], we proposed to suppress the [PERSON]4 clinical measure for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20 under proposed [ORGANIZATION] 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during [PERSON]0, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0. Based on our analysis of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]4 data, we found a significant decrease in response scores as compared to [DATE]34. The [PERSON]4 clinical measure is scored based on three composite measures and three global ratings.120 Global ratings questions employ a scale of 0 to 10, worst to best each of the questions within a composite measure use either Yes or No responses, or response categories ranging from Never to Always to assess the patients experience of care at a facility. [ORGANIZATION] performance on each composite measure is determined by the percent of patients who choose top-box responses that is, most positive or Always to the [PERSON]4 survey questions in each domain. The [PERSON]4 survey is administered twice [ORGANIZATION]02, once in [ORGANIZATION]03 and once in [ORGANIZATION]04 120 Groupings of questions and composite measures can be found at Because of the [LOCATION] we granted in response to [PERSON]0, facilities were not required to submit [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] spring [PERSON]4 data for purposes of [ORGANIZATION]. On [DATE] 2, [ORGANIZATION], we published an interim final rule with comment ORG136 in [ORGANIZATION] titled, [PERSON] and ORG13 [ORGANIZATION]s, Clinical [ORGANIZATION]aboratory Improvement Amendments C[ORGANIZATION]IA, and [ORGANIZATION] and Affordable Care [ORGANIZATION] Additional Policy and Regulatory Revisions in [ORGANIZATION] to the [ORGANIZATION] Public Health Emergency 85 FR [ZIP] referred to herein as the [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] ORG136. In the [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] ORG136, we noted that we would not use any [ORGANIZATION]06 [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] data to calculate [ORGANIZATION]s for the applicable performance period 85 FR [ZIP] through [ORGANIZATION]0[DATE]. Because the [DATE] performance period for the [PERSON]4 measure is [PERSON]95anuary 1, [ORGANIZATION] through [DATE] [DATE], [ORGANIZATION], and the [PERSON]4 survey is administered twice DATE[DATE]4 once in [ORGANIZATION]03 and once in [ORGANIZATION]09, in the proposed rule we stated that we only have data available from [ORGANIZATION]09 [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] survey to calculate facility performance on this measure. Therefore, facilities would only be scored on data based on one [PERSON]4 survey administration for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], rather than two. Even if we were to score facilities based on the one [PERSON]4 survey administered in [ORGANIZATION]09, our preliminary data indicated that 95 percent of facilities would not be eligible for scoring on [PERSON]4 for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. By contrast, 58.9 percent of facilities were not eligible for [PERSON]4 during DATE58. If we were to score the 5 percent of eligible facilities on [PERSON]4, we stated our belief that there would be a significant deviation in national performance on this measure compared to the national performance based on 41.1 percent of facilities eligible for scoring on [PERSON]4 during [PERSON] [DATE] FR [ZIP]. We also stated that this is a significant deviation in national performance on this measure compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0. Given this significant deviation in national performance during the [PERSON]65, we expressed our belief that the [PERSON]4 clinical measure meets the criteria for [ORGANIZATION] 1. We also stated our belief that this significant change in performance may unfairly penalize facilities and that suppressing this measure for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20 would address concerns about the potential unintended consequences of penalizing facilities that treat [ORGANIZATION] diagnosed patients in [ORGANIZATION]. As alternative approaches, we considered changing the performance period or scoring facilities on one survey administration, but otherwise meeting the 30 completed surveys requirement. PERSON8wever, we found that neither of these approaches were feasible extending the performance period would not accurately reflect [PERSON]4 performance during [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], and as discussed above, an estimated 95 percent of facilities would not be eligible for [PERSON]4 scoring on one survey. Therefore, to avoid unfairly penalizing facilities due to their performance on the [PERSON]4 survey for the [DATE] [PERSON], we stated our belief that it is appropriate to suppress the [PERSON]4 measure for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], which is the performance period for the [DATE] [PERSON] program [ORGANIZATION]10. We proposed to suppress this measure for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20, rather than remove it, because we believe that the [PERSON]4 measure is an important part of [ORGANIZATION] measure set.[PERSON] 6191[DATE]PERSON8wever, we were concerned that [PERSON]0 affected measure performance on the current [PERSON]4 measure such that we would not be able to score facilities fairly or equitably on it. Additionally, participating facilities would continue to report the measures data to [PERSON] so that we could monitor the effect of the circumstances on quality measurement and determine the appropriate policies in the future. In the proposed rule, we stated that we would also continue to provide confidential feedback reports to facilities as part of program activities to ensure that they are made aware of the changes in performance rates that we observe [DATE] FR [ZIP]. We also stated our intent to publicly report [DATE] data where feasible and appropriately caveated. We welcomed public comment on our proposal to suppress the [PERSON]4 measure for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposal to suppress the [PERSON]4 measure for [DATE], agreeing that [PERSON]0 has impacted the validity and reliability of performance scoring for [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to suppress the [PERSON]4 measure for [DATE].e. Suppression of [ORGANIZATION] Clinical Measure for [DATE] In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP] through [DATE], we proposed to suppress [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20 under proposed [ORGANIZATION] 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during [PERSON]0, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during [DATE][DATE]0. Based on our analysis of [ORGANIZATION]ong-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure data during [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], we found a significant increase in long-term catheter use as compared to [DATE]34, which may be the result of hesitancy to seek medical treatment among dialysis patients concerned about being exposed to [ORGANIZATION] during the [PERSON]65. In the DATE58 [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we finalized the inclusion of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Vascular Access [ORGANIZATION]ong-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure in [ORGANIZATION] measure set beginning with the PY [ORGANIZATION]8 program 82 FR 50[DATE][DATE]8. The [ORGANIZATION]ong-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure is defined as the percentage of adult hemodialysis patient-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 using a catheter continuously for three [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 or longer for vascular access. The measure is based on vascular access data reported in [PERSON]5 now [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 and excludes patient-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 where a patient has a catheter in [STREET] and has a limited life expectancy. Our analysis based on the available data indicated that long-term catheter use rates increased significantly during [PERSON]0. Average long-term catheter rates were averaging around 12 percent in [DATE]32 and DATE58. In [ORGANIZATION], rates increased to average around 12.25 percent. This increase continued into [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], with rates reaching a peak of 14.[DATE] percent in [PERSON]95une [ORGANIZATION] and declining slightly to 14.3 percent in [PERSON]95uly and [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]. After remaining around 12 percent for 3 consecutive [DATE]81, in the proposed rule we stated that we view a sudden 2 percent increase in average long-term catheter rates as a significant deviation compared to historical performance during immediately preceding [DATE]81 [DATE] FR [DATE]. We were concerned that the COVID-[PERSON]65 impacted the ability of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients to seek treatment from medical providers regarding their catheter use, either due to difficulty accessing treatment due to [ORGANIZATION] precautions at [ORGANIZATION] facilities, or due to increased patient reluctance to seek medical treatment because of risk of [ORGANIZATION] exposure and increased health risks resulting therefrom, and that these contributed to the significant increase in long-term catheter use rates. We proposed to suppress this measure for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20, rather than remove it, because we believe that [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure is an important part of [ORGANIZATION] measure set. PERSON8wever, we were concerned that the [PERSON]65 for [ORGANIZATION] affected measure performance on the current [ORGANIZATION]ong-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure such that we would not be able to score facilities fairly or equitably on it. Additionally, participating facilities would continue to report the measures data to [PERSON] so that we could monitor the effect of the circumstances on quality measurement and determine the appropriate policies in the future. In the proposed rule [DATE] FR [DATE], we stated that we would also continue to provide confidential feedback reports to facilities as part of program activities to ensure that they are made aware of the changes in performance rates that we observe. We also stated our intent to publicly report [DATE] data where feasible and appropriately caveated. We welcomed public comment on our proposal to suppress [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for the [DATE] program [ORGANIZATION]20. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposal to suppress [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for [DATE], agreeing that [PERSON]0 has impacted the validity and reliability of performance scoring for [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to suppress [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure for [DATE].[LOCATION]18 Special Scoring Methodology and Payment Policy for the [DATE] [PERSON] As described in section I[LOCATION]B.2 of the proposed rule, we have considered the impact of operational systems issues preventing facilities from submitting [DATE] through [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] patient and clinical data into the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 from [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] through on or about [DATE]2, [ORGANIZATION]8. Even when facilities are able to submit the [DATE] through [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] patient and clinical data by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]29, [ORGANIZATION]8, we will need time to validate the quality and reliability of the impacted data in order to determine whether all data quality issues have been resolved [DATE] FR [DATE]. In addition, as described in section I[LOCATION]C we stated our belief that four of [ORGANIZATION] measures have been impacted by [PERSON]0 that could result in distorted measure performance for [DATE]. It is not our intention to penalize dialysis facilities based on the performance on data that are not reliable, thus, not reflective of the quality of care that the measures in the program are designed to assess. Therefore, we proposed a special rule for [DATE] scoring for [ORGANIZATION] under which we would calculate measure rates for all measures, but would not calculate achievement and improvement points for any of them because they have all been impacted by the operational systems issues and, as we stated previously, we believe that four of them have additionally been significantly impacted by [ORGANIZATION]. Because we would not calculate achievement and improvement scores for any measures, we also proposed under this special rule that we would[PERSON] 61918not score any of the measures in the four domains or calculate or award Total Performance Scores for any facility. We also proposed to not apply any payment reductions to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities for [DATE]. In order to ensure that a facility is aware of any changes to its measure rates that we have observed, we proposed to provide confidential feedback reports that contain the measure rates we calculated for [DATE]. Performance scores for facilities would be released on [PERSON]8 and footnoted to indicate potential accuracy concerns with the scores. Performance score certificates would be generated with the [ORGANIZATION] showing as Not Applicable. We proposed to codify these policies for [DATE] at 42 [ORGANIZATION] 413.1[DATE][DATE]a and [DATE]. PERSON8wever, we stated that if the proposed measure suppression policies and proposed special scoring and payment policies in the proposed rule were not finalized, the [DATE] [PERSON] payment would be implemented in accordance with our current policy, as well as the payment reduction ranges finalized in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule 84 FR 60[DATE]25 through 60[DATE]2[DATE]. We invited public comment on this proposed special scoring and payment policy for the [DATE] [PERSON]. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Many commenters expressed support for the proposed special scoring methodology and payment policy for [DATE]. Several commenters agreed that quality measure data submitted during [PERSON]0 should not be used for performance scoring or payment in [ORGANIZATION], and expressed their concerns regarding the impact of [PERSON]0 on quality measure data. Several commenters agreed that facilities should not be penalized due to the potential impact of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 issues on the reliability and accuracy of the data. One commenter expressed the belief that this proposal would allow staff members to remain focused on [ORGANIZATION] safety. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support. Comment A few commenters recommended that [PERSON] apply this special scoring methodology and payment policy to [DATE]48 and possibly future [DATE]81, noting the continuing impact of [PERSON]0 on facilities and the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patient population. A few commenters expressed the belief that it is appropriate to let the [ORGANIZATION] system stabilize from the effects of the [PERSON]65 before imposing penalties. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for this feedback. We acknowledge the continuing impact of [PERSON]0 on facilities and the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patient population. We will continue to monitor the impact of [PERSON]0 on [ORGANIZATION] in order to consider, based on the data, whether to propose changes to the scoring methodology for [DATE]48. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion After considering public comments, we are finalizing our special scoring and payment policy for the [DATE] [PERSON] as proposed. We are also finalizing our proposal to codify these policies for [DATE] at 42 [ORGANIZATION] 413.1[DATE][DATE]a and [DATE].E. Updates to Requirements Beginning With the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON]1. PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] Measure Set Under our current policy, we retain all [PERSON] measures from [ORGANIZATION]20 to [ORGANIZATION]20 unless we propose through rulemaking to remove them or otherwise provide notification of immediate removal if a measure raises potential safety issues [DATE][DATE] FR 6[DATE]4[DATE]5. Accordingly, the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] measure set will include the same 14 measures as the [DATE]48 [PERSON] measure set 85 FR [DATE]1465 through [DATE]1466. These measures were described in Table 2 in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP] and are described in Table 2 in this final rule. For the most recent information on each measures technical specifications for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0, we refer readers to the [PERSON] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Measures Manual for the [ORGANIZATION]8 Performance Period.121--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 121 We note that information for the [DATE]1 Performance Period is also now available at CODE [DATE]-P[PERSON] 61919GRAPHIC [ORGANIZATION] OMITTED TR08NO21.001BI[ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]ING CODE [DATE]-C We discuss our proposal to update the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure in the following section.a. Update to the Standardized PERSON8spitalization Ratio [ORGANIZATION] Clinical Measure Beginning With the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] In the [DATE]32 [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we adopted the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure under the authority of section 1881h2Bii of the [ORGANIZATION] 81 FR [DATE][DATE]906 through [DATE][DATE]911. The [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure is a [PERSON]9 [ORGANIZATION]-endorsed all-cause, risk-standardized rate of hospitalizations during a [DATE]88 observation window. The standardized hospitalization ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of hospital admissions that occur for [PERSON] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] dialysis patients treated at a particular facility to the number of hospitalizations that would be expected[PERSON] 61920given the characteristics of the dialysis facilitys patients and the national norm for dialysis facilities. This measure is calculated as a ratio but can also be expressed as a rate. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], we stated that hospitalizations are an important indicator of patient morbidity and quality of life. On average, dialysis patients are admitted to the hospital nearly twice DATE[DATE]4 and spend an average of 11.2 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s in the hospital per [ORGANIZATION]20.1[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54 PERSON8spitalizations account for approximately 33 percent of total [PERSON] expenditures for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients.123 Studies have shown that improved health care delivery and care coordination may help reduce unplanned acute care including [PERSON] rates vary across dialysis facilities even after adjustment for patient characteristics, suggesting that hospitalizations might be influenced by dialysis facility practices. An adjusted facility-level standardized hospitalization ratio, accounting for differences in patients characteristics, plays an important role in identifying potential problems, and helps facilities provide cost-effective quality health care to help limit escalating medical costs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]4.

Available at In the [DATE]32 [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we finalized our proposal to adopt the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure, which was a modified version of the [ORGANIZATION]-endorsed [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure [DATE], as part of [ORGANIZATION] measure set 81 FR [DATE][DATE]911. In that final rule, we stated that our modified [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure would incorporate 210 prevalent comorbidities into our risk adjustment calculation, as our analyses suggested that incorporating prevalent comorbidities would result in a more robust and reliable measure of hospitalization 81 FR [DATE][DATE]906 through [DATE][DATE]90[DATE]. In that final rule, we explained that data used to calculate the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure are derived from an extensive national [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patient database 81 FR [DATE][DATE]908. We noted that the database is comprehensive for [PERSON] Parts A and B patients, and that non-[PERSON] patients are included in all sources except for the [PERSON] payment records. In that final rule, we also stated that [ORGANIZATION] System[PERSON]5 provides tracking by dialysis provider and treatment modality for non-[PERSON] patients, and information on hospitalizations and patient comorbidities are obtained from [PERSON] Inpatient Claims Standard Analysis Files. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we increased the weight of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure from 8.25 percent to 14 percent of the [ORGANIZATION] 83 FR [ZIP] through 5699[DATE]. On [DATE], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] completed its most recent review of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure, a measure maintenance review, and renewed the measures endorsement. As part of this review, the [ORGANIZATION] endorsed updating the prevalent comorbidity adjustment, which would group 210 individual ICD-9-[ORGANIZATION] prevalent comorbidities into 90 condition groups, derived from the [ORGANIZATION]6 AHR[PERSON]58 [ORGANIZATION] groups. The updated prevalent comorbidity adjustment would also limit the source of prevalent comorbidities to inpatient claims. The switch to using only [PERSON] inpatient claims to identify prevalent comorbidities is due to the lack of [PERSON] outpatient claims data for the growing [PERSON] Advantage [PERSON] patient population. By using the original set of [PERSON] claims datasets inpatient, outpatient, hospice, skilled nursing, and home health, the [ORGANIZATION] stated its concern that [PERSON] patient prevalent comorbidities would be systematically biased. These [PERSON] patient prevalent comorbidities would only be populated by [PERSON] inpatient claims, as compared to non-[PERSON] patient prevalent comorbidities that would be populated by the aforementioned set of [PERSON] claim sources. The updated [ORGANIZATION]-endorsed [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure would also include all time at risk for [PERSON] patients, and added a [PERSON] indicator for adjustment in the model. The [ORGANIZATION]-endorsed specifications also included updates to parameterization of existing adjustment factors and re-evaluation of interactions, and also created three distinct groups of patients to use in the [ORGANIZATION] model based on time spent in a skilled nursing facility, noting that nursing home residence is a marker of higher morbidity. The updated [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure was included on the publicly available PERSON45st of Measures under Consideration for [DATE] 21, [ORGANIZATION] MUC PERSON45st, a list of measures under consideration for use in various [PERSON] programs.125 When [ORGANIZATION] PERSON8spital [ORGANIZATION] convened on [PERSON]95anuary 11, [ORGANIZATION]8, it reviewed the MUC PERSON45st, including the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. The [PERSON][DATE]0 PERSON8spital [ORGANIZATION] recognized that hospitalization rates vary across dialysis facilities, even after adjusting for patient characteristics, which suggests that hospitalizations might be influenced by dialysis facility practices. The [PERSON][DATE]0 PERSON8spital [ORGANIZATION] also noted that the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure seeks to improve patient outcomes by measuring hospitalization ratios among dialysis facilities, and that the measure seeks to promote communication between the dialysis facilities and other care settings to improve care transitions.126 In its final report, [ORGANIZATION] supported this measure for rulemaking.12[DATE]--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 125 [PERSON]9.

[PERSON][DATE]0 [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION]8 Considerations for Implementing Measures in [PERSON]11 [ORGANIZATION]s Clinician, PERSON8spital amp [ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]T[PERSON] Accessed on [DATE]84 28, [ORGANIZATION]8 at In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], we proposed to update the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure specifications to align with the [ORGANIZATION]-endorsed updates. These included updates to the risk adjustment method of the measure, which include a prevalent comorbidity adjustment, the addition of [PERSON] patients and a [PERSON] indicator in the model, updates to parameterization of existing adjustment factors and re-evaluation of interactions, and an indicator for a patients time spent in a skilled nursing facility. In the proposed rule, we expressed our belief that adopting these updates would be consistent with our stated goal of evaluating opportunities to more closely align [PERSON] measures with [ORGANIZATION] measure specifications 84 FR 60[DATE]24. The [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure seeks to improve patient outcomes by measuring hospitalization ratios among dialysis facilities, and we stated our belief that these updates would result in a more reliable and robust [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. We sought comment on this proposal to update the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure[PERSON] 61921specifications for use in [ORGANIZATION] beginning with PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment A few commenters expressed support for the proposed updates to the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure specifications. One commenter noted that such updates are [ORGANIZATION]-endorsed and supported by the [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support. Comment A few commenters expressed concern regarding the proposed updates to the risk adjustment method of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure and recommended that [PERSON] perform a sensitivity analysis of the risk model fit, comparing the prior risk models outcomes with the updated risk models performance to assess the impact of the new approach. [ORGANIZATION] We are finalizing the proposed updates to the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure because they are endorsed by the [ORGANIZATION] and would align the specifications of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure with the [ORGANIZATION]-endorsed specifications. Although we are not bound by the [ORGANIZATION]s decisions regarding measure specifications, we believe that adopting these updates is consistent with our stated goal of evaluating opportunities to more closely align [PERSON] measures with [ORGANIZATION] measure specifications 84 FR 60[DATE]24. The updates to the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure were reviewed and endorsed by [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. As part of that [ORGANIZATION] review, both the current and proposed [ORGANIZATION] risk adjustment model results were presented in [ORGANIZATION] and were available for discussion during the [ORGANIZATION] review process. In addition, the [ORGANIZATION] review included comparisons of both the prior and updated risk adjustment model performance for other aspects of the [ORGANIZATION] criteria reliability and validity. Both the [ORGANIZATION] Methodology Panel and ORG1[DATE]3 had the opportunity to review the models performance that is, the risk model fit on those and other endorsement criteria prior to [ORGANIZATION]s decision to endorse the proposed model changes. Because the [ORGANIZATION] review included an analysis of the risk models performance, we believe that the [ORGANIZATION] review effectively constituted a sensitivity review that is, an analysis of the degree to which the elements of the risk model contribute to the risk of hospitalization of the proposed specification changes, because it compared all important criteria used by [ORGANIZATION] between the prior and proposed versions of [ORGANIZATION]. Comment A few commenters expressed concern that the proposed update to the comorbidity adjustment may skew the model toward a sicker patient population, noting that the approach would result in inaccurately low hospitalization rates leading to erroneously high scores. One commenter expressed concern that this may be misleading to patients and might disincentivize improvements that might actually lower hospitalizations. [ORGANIZATION] We developed the proposed updated version of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure to directly correct a progressive bias related to our prior definition of an active [PERSON] patient in the context of the rapid increase in [PERSON] chronic dialysis patients with [PERSON] Advantage coverage. In the prior version of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure, active [PERSON] status was defined by use criteria. An individual patient met our use criteria if they either had 900 or more in paid [PERSON] outpatient dialysis claims or an acute inpatient hospitalization. Either claims-based criterion conveyed active [PERSON] status for purposes of the measure for [ORGANIZATION]30 and two consecutive following [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09. Nearly all [PERSON] fee-for-service patients meet the use criterion of 900 paid claims for dialysis because this amount reflects between 2 to 3 outpatient dialysis treatments at current reimbursement rates. PERSON8wever, the only [PERSON] patients meeting these use criteria were those hospitalized in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]24. As a result, the time at risk calculated in the old [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure underestimated the time at risk for [PERSON] patients because not all are hospitalized in DATE[DATE]4 and virtually no [PERSON] patients meet the other use criterion, due to [PERSON] lack of access to outpatient claims for [PERSON] enrollees. The proposed updated version of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure currently utilizes [PERSON]s [PERSON] to identify [PERSON] Advantage patient status [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]01. Combined with our patient-level treatment history file, we are able to calculate true [PERSON] patient time at risk at a given dialysis facility, without bias from the use test. For the purposes of identifying co-morbidities from [PERSON] Claims for risk adjustment, we use all inpatient claims in the prior [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28. We are able to obtain inpatient claims for both [PERSON] fee-for-service patients as well as [PERSON] patients, as hospitals and other inpatient providers furnish inpatient claims for [PERSON] patients to their [PERSON] Administrative Contractors [PERSON]4s for informational purposes. For beneficiaries enrolled in [PERSON] Advantage, those inpatient claims are often referred to as shadow claims, as they are not used for direct billing. For [PERSON] Fee-for Service beneficiaries, we only use paid inpatient claims. Unlike for [PERSON] fee-for-service beneficiaries, [PERSON] has virtually no access to outpatient claims for [PERSON] Advantage beneficiaries. We no longer use outpatient claims sources to identify co-morbidities, eliminating potential bias related to the lack of access to outpatient claims for [PERSON] patients. Identification of prevalent comorbidities based on only inpatient claims results in fewer comorbidities for each patient compared to use of the universe of [PERSON] claims. PERSON8wever, use of only inpatient claims results in similar numbers and types of comorbidities for [PERSON] patients and other [PERSON] patients. For instance, in an analysis of a set of comorbidity groups used in a recent [ORGANIZATION] calculation, we found that inpatient claims identified 12 comorbid conditions for [PERSON] patients on average compared to 12.4 comorbid conditions for other non-[PERSON] [PERSON] patients. In the revised [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure, we use all available inpatient claims in the prior [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28 for both Fee-For-Service [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] patients. While we agree that limiting co-morbidity ascertainment to inpatient claims results in a less comprehensive set of co-morbidities, our proposed updated risk-adjustment methodology protects against potential bias in determining comorbidity burden due to differences in our access to claims data for [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] patients discussed above. As the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure relies on use of inpatient claims to identify co-morbidities in the prior [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28, we expect that this lookback period reflects more current conditions that are more likely to be predictive of hospitalization risk. Therefore, we do not believe that outpatient claim derived co-morbidities are as clinically relevant to the risk-adjustment needed for the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. Moreover, our approach does not require us to exclude [PERSON] patients from the measures. We do not want to eliminate a sizable percentage of the current observations from the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure, particularly given the anticipated growth of [PERSON] patients with diagnoses of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] that will result from changes to the [PERSON] program regulations related to the ability of prevalent [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients to choose [PERSON] plans beginning in [ORGANIZATION]8, as finalized in the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] Contract Year [ORGANIZATION]8 [ORGANIZATION] to the [PERSON] Advantage [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] Prescription Drug Benefit [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON] Cost Plan [ORGANIZATION] final rule[PERSON] 619[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5485 FR [ZIP] through [DATE], which implemented provisions of [DATE] Cures [ORGANIZATION] to remove the prohibition on [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] beneficiaries enrolling in an [PERSON] plan.128 Finally, to account for potential underlying co-morbidity differences between [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] patients that cannot be observed due to potentially incomplete claims-based ascertainment of health status for [PERSON] patients, we included all time at risk for [PERSON] Advantage patients and added a [PERSON] Advantage indicator for adjustment in the model.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 128 [DATE] Cures [ORGANIZATION] Pub. GPE25 114-255 amended sections [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]33, and [ORGANIZATION]34 of the [ORGANIZATION] to expand enrollment options for individuals with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] and make associated payment and coverage changes to the [PERSON] and original [PERSON] programs. Specifically, since the beginning of the [PERSON] program, individuals with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] have not been able to enroll in [PERSON] plans subject to limited exceptions. [ORGANIZATION]tion 1[DATE]006a of the Cures [ORGANIZATION] removed this prohibition effective for plan [DATE]81 beginning on or after [PERSON]95anuary 1, [ORGANIZATION]8.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regarding the possibility that the [ORGANIZATION] risk model changes described above would increase model bias, we disagree and believe that the concern that the revised model would bias the [ORGANIZATION] toward sicker patients is unfounded. First, we have discussed above the frequency of inpatient claims diagnoses for [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] patients under the new approach. The average number of diagnoses reported from inpatient claims for [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] patients are very similar, strongly suggesting that using only the inpatient claims source is an accurate reflection of the comorbidities for both patient populations. The proposed [ORGANIZATION] risk model also includes a [PERSON] Advantage indicator variable in the model that would guard against bias by minimizing the potential impact of differences in unobserved comorbidities from outpatient claims sources. Considering that the proposed model eliminates a sizeable known bias related to the lack of data about outpatient claims for [PERSON] patients, we believe the proposed [ORGANIZATION] risk model provides a more accurate representation of dialysis facility performance and, therefore, utility to the dialysis community. Comment A few commenters expressed concern regarding the parameterization modifications of existing adjustment factors included in the proposed updates to the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. Although a few commenters agreed that the updated parameterization of existing adjustment factors and reevaluation of interactions is important, they expressed concern that the p-values, or calculated probability values, of [ORGANIZATION] risk models indicate that the model would not be generalizable. [ORGANIZATION] We believe that the proposed risk adjustment model, which includes updates to the parameterization of existing adjustment factors that is, modifying the functional forms of adjustment factors and re-evaluation of interactions, is more appropriate because it captures all [PERSON] patients. Since we are only using the [ORGANIZATION] risk models for purposes of the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure, we believe that generalizability is not an issue. Comment One commenter requested that [PERSON] indicate how [PERSON] Advantage patients will be identified under the proposed [ORGANIZATION] measure specifications. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] Advantage patient status will be obtained from the [PERSON] [PERSON] EDB. We will confirm the presence of usable ICD diagnosis codes from [PERSON] inpatient claims. Comment A few commenters recommended that [ORGANIZATION] should use true risk-standardized rate measures in order to more accurately reflect facility performance, as the ratio measures have relatively wide confidence intervals that can lead to facilities being misclassified and their actual performance not being reported. One commenter expressed the belief that a more direct, transparent, risk-adjusted rate measure would result in more significant improvement, noting that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patient hospitalization rates have increased between [ORGANIZATION]5 and [PERSON] and questioned whether the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure has had a meaningful impact. [ORGANIZATION] We believe that the use of a ratio is appropriate for the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. The ratio estimate that we proposed is the ratio of the facility adjusted rate to the standard rate. The ratio is also a scientifically valid approach, and ratio measures are well accepted in the published literature. Additionally, the risk-adjustment approach which is based on application of a specific risk-adjustment model currently used for the [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] measures leads naturally to a standardized ratio, which compares the rate for this facility with the national rate, having adjusted for the patient mix and is relatively straightforward. We do not believe that rates are more direct and transparent than ratios, and we disagree with the commenter who stated that a risk-adjusted rate measure would lead to significant improvement in performance on the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure. PERSON45ke ratios, risk-adjusted rates are not the same as actual rates and require a consideration of the patient mix adjustment for interpretation. Furthermore, because the indirect standardized rate is equal to the multiplication of the indirect standardized ratio and a national rate, where the national rate is a constant for all facilities, classifications of facilities based on indirect standardized ratios and rates are equivalent. Finally, we disagree that hospitalization rates have increased between [ORGANIZATION]5 and [PERSON]. PERSON8spitalization rates have decreased since [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]56 as evidenced by the negative coefficients for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28 from the [ORGANIZATION] model. The hospitalization rate for [ORGANIZATION]5 decreased by 2.[DATE] percent compared to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]56 p-value lt0.0001. Subsequent [DATE]81 had a larger decrease in the hospitalization rate compared to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]56 at 6.8 percent lower for [DATE]38 and about 5.[DATE] percent lower for [PERSON] p-valuelt0.0001 for both compared to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]56. Although [PERSON] had a slightly higher rate than [DATE]38, there is an overall downward trend. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to update the [ORGANIZATION] clinical measure specifications for use in [ORGANIZATION] beginning with PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0.2. [PERSON] for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]tion 1881h4A of the [ORGANIZATION] requires the [ORGANIZATION]retary to establish performance standards with respect to the measures selected for [ORGANIZATION] for a performance period with respect to DATE[DATE]4. The performance standards must include levels of achievement and improvement, as required by section 1881h4B of the [ORGANIZATION], and must be established prior to the beginning of the performance period for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]24 involved, as required by section 1881h4C of the [ORGANIZATION]. We refer readers to the [ORGANIZATION] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]40 [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]6 FR [DATE]02[DATE][DATE] for a discussion of the achievement and improvement standards that we have established for clinical measures used in [ORGANIZATION]. We define the terms achievement threshold, benchmark, improvement threshold, and performance standard in our regulations at [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE], 3, [DATE], and 12, respectively.a. Update to the [PERSON] Applicable to the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 Clinical Measures Our current policy is to automatically adopt a performance and baseline period for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]11 that is [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]38 advanced from those specified for the previous payment [ORGANIZATION]20 84 FR 60[DATE]28. Under this policy, [ORGANIZATION] is currently the performance period and [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is the baseline period for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON]. PERSON8wever, under the nationwide [LOCATION] that we granted in[PERSON] 61923response to [PERSON]0, [ORGANIZATION]46 data for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] are excluded from scoring for purposes of [ORGANIZATION]. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 3635[DATE], we stated that we were concerned that it would be difficult to assess levels of achievement and improvement if the performance standards were based on partial [ORGANIZATION]20 data.129 Our preliminary analysis indicated that the effect of the excluded data would create higher performance standards for certain measures and lower performance standards for other measures, which may skew achievement and improvement thresholds for facilities and therefore may result in performance standards that do not accurately reflect levels of achievement and improvement.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 129 We note that for most [PERSON] measures, this partial [ORGANIZATION]20 data would be measure data from [PERSON]95uly and [DATE] [ORGANIZATION].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our current policy substitutes the performance standard, achievement threshold, andor benchmark for a measure for a performance [ORGANIZATION]20 if final numerical values for the performance standard, achievement threshold, andor benchmark are worse than the numerical values for that measure in the previous [ORGANIZATION]20 of [ORGANIZATION] 82 FR 50[DATE]64. We stated in the proposed rule that we adopted this policy because we believe that [ORGANIZATION] should not have lower performance standards than in [DATE]34 [DATE] FR 3635[DATE]. PERSON8wever, our general policy provides flexibility to substitute the performance standard, achievement threshold, and benchmark in appropriate cases 82 FR 50[DATE]64. Although the lower performance standards would be substituted with those from the prior [ORGANIZATION]20, the higher performance standards would be used to set performance standards for certain measures, even though they would be based on partial [ORGANIZATION]20 data. In the proposed rule [DATE] FR 3635[DATE], we stated that we were concerned that this may create performance standards for certain measures that would be difficult for facilities to attain with a full 12 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 of data. Therefore, in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 3635[DATE], we proposed to calculate the performance standards for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 using [ORGANIZATION] data, which are the most recently available full [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28 of data we can use to calculate those standards. Due to the impact of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] data that are excluded from [ORGANIZATION] for scoring purposes, we stated our belief that using [ORGANIZATION] data for performance standard setting purposes is appropriate. Consistent with our established policy, we would continue to use the [DATE][DATE][DATE] numerical values for performance standard, achievement threshold, and benchmark if the most recent full [ORGANIZATION]s final numerical values are worse. We welcomed public comments on this proposal. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposed use of [ORGANIZATION] data for calculating performance standards, achievement thresholds, and benchmarks for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0. A few commenters noted that the significant impact of [PERSON]0 would make [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] measure data inappropriate for setting PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 performance standards. A few commenters supported the proposal because [ORGANIZATION] is the most recently available full [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28 of data. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support. Comment One commenter expressed concern with the proposed use of [ORGANIZATION] data for calculating performance standards, achievement thresholds, and benchmarks for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0, noting that the ongoing [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]65 continues to impact measure performance and that using [ORGANIZATION] as a pre-pandemic baseline for setting performance standards may unfairly penalize facilities. [ORGANIZATION] We acknowledge the commenters concern regarding the ongoing impact of [PERSON]0, but disagree that using [ORGANIZATION] data for calculating performance standards will unfairly penalize facilities. We note that, due to the nationwide [LOCATION] granted in response to [PERSON]0 that excluded [ORGANIZATION]46 data from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], only 6 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] data would be used to calculate performance standards, achievement thresholds, and benchmarks for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0. We believe that there is a greater risk of unfairly penalizing facilities based on performance standards calculated using only 6 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] data, as our preliminary analysis indicated that the effect of the excluded data would create higher performance standards for certain measures and lower performance standards for other measures which may not accurately reflect levels of achievement and improvement. Comment One commenter expressed concern that the proposed update only addresses achievement scores, and requested that [PERSON] clarify what [ORGANIZATION]20 improvement scores will be based on. [ORGANIZATION] We proposed to use [ORGANIZATION] data to calculate all performance standards for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0, including achievement and improvement thresholds. This is consistent with the definition of performance standards codified at 42 [ORGANIZATION] [DATE]2, which includes all of the performance levels used to award points to a facility. Therefore, the improvement scores will be calculated using [ORGANIZATION] as the baseline [ORGANIZATION]20. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to calculate the performance standards for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 using [ORGANIZATION] data.b. Finalized [PERSON] for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] Table 3 displays the achievement thresholds, 50th percentiles of the national performance, and benchmarks for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 clinical measures, and in the proposed rule we stated that we would use these standards if our proposal to use [ORGANIZATION] as the baseline period is finalized [DATE] FR 3635[DATE]. As discussed in I[LOCATION]E.2.a of this final rule, we are finalizing our proposal to calculate the performance standards for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] using [ORGANIZATION] data.BI[ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]ING CODE [DATE]-P[PERSON] 61924GRAPHIC [ORGANIZATION] OMITTED TR08NO21.002 In addition, we summarize in Table 4 existing requirements for successful reporting on reporting measures in the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON]. We did not make any proposals to change these standards as a result of [PERSON]0.[PERSON] 61925GRAPHIC [ORGANIZATION] OMITTED TR08NO21.0033. Eligibility Requirements for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] Our current minimum eligibility requirements for scoring [ORGANIZATION] measures are described in Table 5.[PERSON] 61926GRAPHIC [ORGANIZATION] OMITTED TR08NO21.0044. Payment [PERSON] for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] Under our current policy, a facility will not receive a payment reduction for a payment [ORGANIZATION]20 in connection with its performance for [ORGANIZATION] if it achieves a [ORGANIZATION] that is at or above the minimum [ORGANIZATION] m[ORGANIZATION] that we establish for the payment [ORGANIZATION]20. We have defined the m[ORGANIZATION] in our regulations at [ORGANIZATION]. 413.1[DATE]8a8 as, with respect to a payment [ORGANIZATION]20, the [ORGANIZATION] that an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility would receive if, during the baseline period it performed at the 50th percentile of national performance on all clinical measures and the median of national [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility performance on all reporting measures. Our current policy, which is codified at [ORGANIZATION]. 413.1[DATE][DATE] of our regulations, also implements the payment reductions on a sliding scale using ranges that reflect payment reduction differentials of 0.5 percent for each 10 points that the facilitys [ORGANIZATION] falls below the m[ORGANIZATION] [DATE]6 FR 634 through 635. For PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0, based on available data, a facility must meet or exceed a m[ORGANIZATION] of 5[DATE] in order to avoid a payment reduction. We note that the m[ORGANIZATION] in this final rule is based on data from [ORGANIZATION] because we are finalizing our proposal to calculate the performance standards using [ORGANIZATION] data. We refer readers to Table 3 of this final rule for the finalized values of the 50th percentile of national performance for each clinical measure. We stated in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule that under our current policy, a facility that achieves a [ORGANIZATION] of 56 or below would receive a payment reduction based on the [ORGANIZATION] ranges indicated in Table 6 [DATE] FR [ZIP] through [ZIP]. Table 6 of this final rule is a reproduction of Table 6 from the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule without any changes.[PERSON] 6192[DATE]GRAPHIC [ORGANIZATION] OMITTED TR08NO21.005BI[ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]ING CODE [DATE]-C In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], we stated that if we did not finalize the proposed update to our performance standards policy as described in the proposed rule [DATE] FR 3635[DATE], then we would update the m[ORGANIZATION] for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0, as well as the payment reduction ranges for [ORGANIZATION]6, in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] final rule using data from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON8wever, as discussed in section I[LOCATION]E.2.a of this final rule, we are finalizing as proposed the update to our performance standards for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0, and therefore we will use the m[ORGANIZATION] and payment reduction ranges for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 that are described in Table 6.[PERSON] Updates for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 [PERSON]1. Continuing Measures for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 [PERSON] Under our previously adopted policy, the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 [PERSON] measure set will also be used for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. We did not propose to adopt any new measures beginning with the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 [PERSON].2. Performance Period for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 [PERSON] We continue to believe that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]80 performance and baseline periods provide us sufficiently reliable quality measure data for [ORGANIZATION]. Under this policy, we would adopt [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]19 as the performance period and [ORGANIZATION]5 as the baseline period for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 [PERSON]. We did not propose any changes to this policy.3. [PERSON] for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]tion 1881h4A of the [ORGANIZATION] requires the [ORGANIZATION]retary to establish performance standards with respect to the measures selected for [ORGANIZATION] for a performance period with respect to DATE[DATE]4. The performance standards must include levels of achievement and improvement, as required by section 1881h4B of the [ORGANIZATION], and must be established prior to the beginning of the performance period for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]24 involved, as required by section 1881h4C of the [ORGANIZATION]. We refer readers to the [DATE][DATE] [ORGANIZATION] final rule [DATE]6 FR [DATE]02[DATE][DATE] for a discussion of the achievement and improvement standards that we have established for clinical measures used in [ORGANIZATION]. We define the terms achievement threshold, benchmark, improvement threshold, and performance standard in our regulations at [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE], 3, [DATE], and 12, respectively. In section I[LOCATION]E.2.a of this final rule, we note that we are finalizing our proposal to use [ORGANIZATION] data for purposes of calculating the performance standards for PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 because, due to the anticipated impact of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] data that is excluded from [ORGANIZATION] for scoring purposes during [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], we believe that using [ORGANIZATION] data for performance standard setting purposes would be appropriate.a. [PERSON] for Clinical Measures in the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 [PERSON] At this time, we do not have the necessary data to assign numerical values to the achievement thresholds, benchmarks, and 50th percentiles of national performance for the clinical measures for the PY [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 [PERSON] because we do not have [ORGANIZATION]5 data.

Closing the Health Equity Gap in [PERSON] [PERSON]58uality [ORGANIZATION]s Request for Information Persistent inequities in health care outcomes exist in [LOCATION] [PERSON] , including among [PERSON] patients. In recognition of persistent health disparities and the importance of closing the health equity gap, in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule we requested information on expanding several related [PERSON] programs to make reporting of health disparities based on social risk factors and race and ethnicity, and disability more comprehensive and actionable for dialysis facilities, providers, and patients [DATE] FR [ZIP] through [ZIP]. The [ORGANIZATION] that was included in the proposed rule is part of an ongoing effort across [PERSON] to evaluate appropriate initiatives to reduce health disparities. Feedback will be used to inform the creation of a future, comprehensive, [ORGANIZATION] focused on closing the health equity gap in [PERSON] programs and policies. This [ORGANIZATION] contained four parts [LOCATION]. This section provided information on existing statements describing our commitment to health equity, and existing initiatives with an emphasis on reducing disparity.

Solicitation of public comment. This section specified 11 requests for feedback on these topics. We reviewed feedback on these topics and note our intention for an additional [ORGANIZATION] or rulemaking on this topic in the future.a. [LOCATION] Significant and persistent inequities in health care outcomes exist in the [PERSON] 130 Belonging to a racial or ethnic minority group, living with a disability, being a member of the lesbian, gay, [LOCATION], transgender, and queer [ORGANIZATION]GBT[PERSON]58 community, living in a rural area, or being near or below the poverty level, is often associated with worse health outcomes.1[DATE] 132 133 134 135 136 13[DATE] 138 Such disparities in health outcomes are the result of number of factors, but importantly for [PERSON] programs, although not the sole determinant, poor access and provision of lower quality health care contribute to health disparities. For instance, numerous studies have shown that among [PERSON] beneficiaries, racial and ethnic minority individuals often receive lower quality of care, report lower experiences of care, and experience more frequent hospital readmissions and operative complications.139 140 141 142 143 144 Readmission rates for common conditions in [ORGANIZATION] Readmissions Reduction [ORGANIZATION] are higher for [LOCATION] [PERSON] beneficiaries and higher for Hispanic [PERSON] beneficiaries with [ORGANIZATION] and Acute Myocardial Infarction.145 146 14[DATE] 148 149 Although [LOCATION] Americans represent [DATE].5 percent of all older adult [PERSON] beneficiaries, they represent 28 percent of those with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION].150 Among individuals with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] the odds of 30-[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19 hospital readmission are 19 percent higher for [LOCATION] beneficiaries as compared with white beneficiaries.151 Studies have also shown that African Americans are significantly more likely than white Americans to die prematurely from heart disease and[PERSON] 61929stroke.1[DATE] The [ORGANIZATION] pandemic has further illustrated many of these longstanding health inequities with higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality among [LOCATION], [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], and Indigenous and Native American persons relative to white persons.153 154 In the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patient population, one study found that the rate of [ORGANIZATION] hospitalizations among dialysis patients peaked at 40 times higher than the rate in the general population during the pandemic, with [LOCATION], [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION], and Asian persons hospitalized at a higher rate than white persons.155 As noted by ORG1[DATE]8, long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put many people from racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick and dying from [ORGANIZATION].156 One important strategy for addressing these important inequities is by improving data collection to allow for better measurement and reporting on equity across our programs and policies.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 130 GPE28 [ORGANIZATION].

In this request for public comment, we addressed only the eighth initiative listed above, the [PERSON] Disparity Methods, which we have implemented for measures in [ORGANIZATION] Readmissions Reduction [ORGANIZATION] and are considering in other programs, including [ORGANIZATION].

[ORGANIZATION]5. Accounting for Social Risk Factors in [PERSON] Payment Identifying Social Risk Factors. [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] [PERSON]04. 169 Current [PERSON] Disparity Methods We first sought public comment on potential confidential and public reporting of [PERSON] measure data stratified by social risk factors in the DATE58 [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule 82 FR [DATE]202. We initially focused on stratification by dual eligibility, which is consistent with recommendations from [PERSON]05s First Report to [PERSON]3 which was required by the Improving [PERSON] Post-Acute Care Transformation IM[ORGANIZATION]T [ORGANIZATION] of [PERSON] Pub. GPE25 113-185.1[DATE]0 This report found that in the context of value-based purchasing [ORGANIZATION] programs, dual eligibility was among the most powerful predictors of poor health outcomes among those social risk factors that [PERSON]05 examined and tested.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1[DATE]0 In the FY [PERSON] [PERSON]06 final rule, we also solicited feedback on two potential methods for illuminating differences in outcomes rates among patient groups within a providers patient population that would also allow for a comparison of those differences, or disparities, across providers for [ORGANIZATION] I[PERSON]58R [ORGANIZATION] 82 FR [ZIP] through [DATE]. The first method the Within-PERSON8spital disparity method promotes quality improvement by calculating differences in outcome rates among patient groups within a hospital while accounting for their clinical risk factors. This method also allows for a comparison of the magnitude of disparity across hospitals, so hospitals could assess how well they are closing disparity gaps compared to other hospitals. The second methodological approach the [ORGANIZATION]-PERSON8spital method is complementary and assesses hospitals outcome rates for dual-eligible patients only, across hospitals, allowing for a comparison among hospitals on their performance caring for their patients with social risk factors. In the DATE58 [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule 82 FR [DATE]202 through [DATE]203, we also specifically solicited feedback on which social risk factors provide the most valuable information to stakeholders. In addition, feedback was solicited on the methodology for illuminating differences in outcomes rates among patient groups within a providers patient population that would also allow for a comparison of those differences, or disparities, across providers. Overall, comments supported the use of dual eligibility as a proxy for social risk, although commenters also suggested investigation of additional social risk factors, and we continue to consider commenter suggestions for which risk factors provide the most valuable information to [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] Potential Expansion of the [PERSON] Disparity Methods to [ORGANIZATION] We are committed to advancing health equity by improving data collection to better measure and analyze disparities across programs and policies.1[DATE]1 As we previously noted, we have been considering, among other things, expanding our efforts to provide stratified data for additional social risk factors and measures, optimizing the ease-of-use of the results, enhancing public transparency of equity results, and building towards provider accountability for health equity. We sought public comment on the potential stratification of quality measures in [ORGANIZATION] across two social risk factors dual eligibility and raceethnicity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1[DATE]1 ORG1. [PERSON] [PERSON]58uality Strategy. [ORGANIZATION]5. Stratification of [PERSON]58uality Measure Results--Dual Eligibility As described in the previous section, landmark reports by [PERSON]08 and [PERSON]05,1[DATE]3 which have examined the influence of social risk factors on several of our quality programs, have shown that in the context of [ORGANIZATION] programs, dual eligibility, as an indicator of social risk, is a powerful predictor of poor health outcomes. We are considering stratification of quality measure results in [ORGANIZATION] and are considering which measures would be most appropriate for stratification and if dual eligibility would be a meaningful social risk factor for stratification.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1[DATE]2 [PERSON]03 and [ORGANIZATION]9. [ORGANIZATION]5. Accounting for Social Risk Factors in [PERSON] Payment Identifying Social Risk Factors. [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] [PERSON]04. 1[DATE]3 For [ORGANIZATION], we would consider disparity reporting using two disparity methods derived from the Within-[ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] methods. The first method based on the Within-PERSON8spital disparity method, described previously would aim to promote quality improvement by calculating differences in outcome rates between dual and non-dual eligible patient groups within a facility while accounting for their clinical risk factors. This method would allow for a comparison of those differences, or disparities, across facilities, so facilities could assess how well they are closing disparity gaps compared to other facilities. The second approach based on the [ORGANIZATION]-PERSON8spital method would be complementary and assesses facilities outcome rates for subgroups of patients, such as dual eligible patients, across facilities, allowing for a comparison among facilities on their performance caring for their patients with social risk factors.2 Stratification of [PERSON]58uality Measure Results--[ORGANIZATION] and Ethnicity The Administrations Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities[PERSON] 619[DATE]Through [PERSON]10 directs agencies to assess potential barriers that underserved communities and individuals may face to enrollment in and access to benefits and services in [PERSON]11 programs. As summarized earlier in the preamble, studies have shown that among [PERSON] beneficiaries, racial and ethnic minority persons often experience worse health outcomes, including more frequent hospital readmissions and procedural complications.1[DATE]4 We also note that the prevalence of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] is higher among racial minorities.1[DATE]5 For example, in [ORGANIZATION]5 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] prevalence was approximately 9.5 times greater in Native Hawaiians and [ORGANIZATION], 3.[DATE] times greater in African Americans, 1.5 times greater in American Indians and [PERSON], and 1.3 times greater in Asians.1[DATE]6 An important part of identifying and addressing inequities in health care is improving data collection to allow us to better measure and report on equity across our programs and policies. We are considering stratification of quality measure results in [ORGANIZATION] by race and ethnicity, and are identifying which measures would be most appropriate for stratification.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1[DATE]4 1[DATE]5 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]4.

In the [PERSON]1 standards, Hispanic or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] is the only ethnicity category included, and since race and ethnicity are two separate and distinct concepts, persons who report themselves as Hispanic or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] can be of any race.1[DATE]8 Another example, the [ORGANIZATION] amp Ethnicity--[PERSON]1 code system in [PERSON]12 PHIN Vocabulary Access and Distribution Systems VADS 1[DATE]9 permits a much more granular structured recording of a patients race and ethnicity with its inclusion of over 900 concepts for race and ethnicity. The recording and exchange of patient race and ethnicity at such a granular level can facilitate the accurate identification and analysis of health disparities based on race and ethnicity. Further, the [ORGANIZATION] amp Ethnicity--[PERSON]1 code system has a hierarchy that rolls up to the [PERSON]1 minimum categories for race and ethnicity and, thus, supports aggregation and reporting using the [PERSON]1 standard. [PERSON]13 [PERSON]1[DATE] includes both the [PERSON]1 and [PERSON]1 standards in its criterion for certified health IT products.180 For race and ethnicity, a certified health IT product must be able to express both detailed races and ethnicities using any of the 900 plus concepts in the [ORGANIZATION] amp Ethnicity--[PERSON]1 code system in PHIN VADS, as well as aggregate each one of a patients races and ethnicities to the categories in the [PERSON]1 standard for race and ethnicity. This approach can reduce burden on providers recording demographics using certified products.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1[DATE][DATE] [PERSON]14 ORG12, [PERSON]15.

In working with our contractors, two algorithms have been developed to indirectly estimate the race and ethnicity of [PERSON] beneficiaries as described further in the next section. We believe that using indirect estimation can help to overcome the current limitations of demographic information and enable timelier reporting of equity results until longer term collaborations to improve demographic data quality across the health care sector materialize. The use of indirectly estimated race and ethnicity for conducting stratified reporting does not [STREET] any additional collection or reporting burdens on facilities as these data are derived using existing administrative and [PERSON]25-linked data. Indirect estimation relies on a statistical imputation method for inferring a missing variable or improving an imperfect administrative variable using a related set of information that is more readily available.188 Indirectly estimated data are most commonly used at the population level such as the facility or health plan-level, where aggregated results form a more accurate description of the population than existing, imperfect data sets. These methods often estimate race and ethnicity using a combination of other data sources which are predictive of self-identified race and ethnicity, such as language preference, information about race and ethnicity in our administrative records, first and last names matched to validated lists of names correlated to specific national origin groups, and the racial and ethnic composition of the surrounding neighborhood. Indirect estimation has been used in other settings to support population-based equity measurement when self-identified data are not available.189--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 188 [ORGANIZATION].

One indirect estimation approach, developed by our contractor, uses [PERSON] administrative data, first name and surname matching, derived from the [PERSON] [PERSON]25 and other sources, with beneficiary language preference, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] of residence, and the source of the race and ethnicity code in [PERSON] administrative data to reclassify some beneficiaries as Hispanic or Asian Pacific Islander [PERSON][DATE].190 In recent [DATE]81, we have also worked with another contractor to develop a new approach, the [PERSON] Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding [ORGANIZATION], which combines [PERSON] administrative data, first and surname matching, geocoded residential address linked to the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]83 [PERSON] [PERSON]25, and uses both Bayesian updating and multinomial logistic regression to estimate the probability of belonging to each of six racialethnic groups.191--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 190 [PERSON]82, [PERSON], amp [PERSON]83, [PERSON] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3.

[PERSON]95anuary [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]3.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSON8wever, despite the high degree of statistical accuracy of the indirect estimation algorithms under consideration there remains the small risk of unintentionally introducing bias. For example, if the indirect estimation is not as accurate in correctly estimating race and ethnicity in certain geographies or populations it could lead to some bias in the method results. Such bias might result in slight overestimation or underestimation of the quality of care received by a given group. We believe this amount of bias is considerably less than would be expected if stratified reporting was conducted using the race and ethnicity currently contained in our administrative data. Indirect estimation of race and ethnicity is envisioned as an intermediate step, filling the pressing need for more accurate demographic information for the purposes of exploring inequities in service delivery, while allowing newer approaches, as described in the next section, for enhancing demographic data collection. We expressed interest in learning more about, and solicited comments about, the potential benefits and challenges associated with measuring facility equity using an imputation algorithm to enhance existing administrative data quality for race and ethnicity until self-reported information is sufficiently available.3 Improving [PERSON] Data Collection Stratified facility-level reporting using indirectly estimated race and ethnicity and dual eligibility would represent an important advance in our ability to provide equity reports to facilities. PERSON8wever, self-reported disability status, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity data remain the gold standard for classifying an individual according to disability status, race, or ethnicity. The [PERSON] [PERSON]58uality Strategy outlines our commitment to strengthening infrastructure and data systems by ensuring that standardized demographic information is collected to identify disparities in health care delivery outcomes.196 Collection and[PERSON] 61933sharing of a standardized set of social, psychological, and behavioral data by facilities, including disability status and race and ethnicity, using electronic data definitions which permit nationwide, interoperable health information exchange, can significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of our equity reporting.19[DATE] This could potentially include expansion to additional social risk factors, such as language preference and disability status, where accuracy of administrative data is currently limited. We are mindful that additional resources, including data collection and staff training may be necessary to ensure that conditions are created whereby all patients are comfortable answering all demographic questions, and that individual preferences for non-response are maintained.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 196 The ORG1. [PERSON] [PERSON]58uality Strategy. [ORGANIZATION]5. 19[DATE] [PERSON]13. United [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Core Data for Interoperability Draft Version 2. [ORGANIZATION]8. We are also interested in learning about and solicited comments on current data collection practices by facilities to capture demographic data elements such as race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation and gender identity [PERSON], language preference, and disability status. Further, we are interested in potential challenges facing facility collection of a minimum set of demographic data elements in alignment with national data collection standards such as the standards finalized by the Affordable Care [ORGANIZATION] 198 and standards for interoperable exchange such as the [PERSON] Core Data for Interoperability put forth by [PERSON]1[DATE] for incorporation in certified health IT products as part of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]56 Edition of health IT certification criteria 199. Advancing data interoperability through collection of a minimum set of demographic data collection has the potential for improving the robustness of the disparity methods results, potentially permitting reporting using more accurate, self-reported, information, such as race and ethnicity, and expanding reporting to additional dimensions of equity, including stratified reporting by disability status.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 198 199 [ORGANIZATION] of an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] Equity Score To [ORGANIZATION] As we describe previously, we are considering expanding the disparity methods to include two social risk factors dual eligibility and raceethnicity. This approach would improve the comprehensiveness of health equity information provided to facilities. Aggregated results from multiple measures and multiple social risk factors, from the [PERSON] Disparity Methods, in the format of a summary score, can improve the usefulness of the equity results. In working with our contractors, we recently developed an equity summary score for [PERSON] Advantage contractplans, the Health Equity Summary Score [PERSON]39, with application to stratified reporting using two social risk factors Dual eligibility and race and as described in [ORGANIZATION] to At-Risk Groups with a Health Equity Summary Score.200--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 200 Agniel D, [PERSON][DATE] [PERSON]0, [PERSON]5[DATE] [PERSON]58, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to At-Risk Groups with a Health Equity Summary Score. [PERSON]38. Published online [DATE]1, [DATE] [ORGANIZATION][DATE]9. doi 10.100[DATE]s11606-019-054[DATE]3-x.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The [PERSON]39 calculates standardized and combined performance scores blended across the two social risk factors. The [PERSON]39 also combines results of the within-plan similar to the Within-[ORGANIZATION] method and across-plan method similar to the [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] method across multiple performance measures. We are considering building an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] Equity Score, not yet developed, which would be modeled off the [PERSON]39 but adapted to the context of risk-adjusted facility outcome measures and potentially other [PERSON] quality measures. We envision that the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] Equity Score would synthesize results for a range of measures and using multiple social risk factors, using measures and social risk factors which would be reported to facilities as part of the [PERSON] Disparity Methods. We believe that creation of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] Equity Score has the potential to supplement the overall measure data already reporting on the [PERSON]40 or successor website, by providing easy to interpret information regarding disparities measured within individual facilities and across facilities nationally. A summary score would decrease burden by minimizing the number of measure results provided and providing an overall indicator of equity. The [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] Equity Score under consideration would potentially Summarize facility performance across multiple social risk factors initially dual eligibility and indirectly estimated race and ethnicity, as described above. Summarize facility performance across the two disparity methods that is, the Within-[ORGANIZATION] Disparity Method and the [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] Disparity Method and potentially multiple measures. Prior to any future public reporting of stratified measure data using indirectly estimated race and ethnicity information, if we determine that an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] Equity Score can be feasibly and accurately calculated, we would provide results of the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] Equity Score, in confidential facility specific reports which facilities and their [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Networks would be able to download. Any potential future proposal to display the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] Equity Score on the [PERSON]40 or successor website would be made through future [ORGANIZATION] or rulemaking.d. Solicitation of Public Comment We sought comment on the possibility of stratifying [PERSON] measures by dual eligibility and race and ethnicity. We solicited public comments on the application of the within-facility or across-facility disparities methods if we were to stratify [PERSON] measures. We also sought comment on the possibility of facility collection of standardized demographic information for the purposes of potential future quality reporting and measure stratification. In addition, we sought comment on the potential design of a facility equity score for calculating results across multiple social risk factors and measures, including race and disability. Any data pertaining to these areas that are recommended for collection for measure reporting for a [PERSON] program and any potential public disclosure on [PERSON]40 or successor website would be addressed through a separate and future notice-and-comment rulemaking. We plan to continue working with [PERSON]05, facilities, the public, and other key stakeholders on this important issue to identify policy solutions that achieve the goals of attaining health equity for all patients and minimizing unintended consequences. We noted for readers that responses to the [ORGANIZATION] will not directly impact payment decisions. We also noted our intention for additional [ORGANIZATION] or rulemaking on this topic in the future. Specifically, we invited public comment on the following[PERSON] [ZIP][ORGANIZATION] Potential Stratification of [PERSON]58uality Measure Results The possible stratification of facility-specific reports for [PERSON] measure data by dual-eligibility status, including which measures would be most appropriate for stratification The potential future application of indirect estimation of race and ethnicity information to permit stratification of measure data for reporting [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility-level disparity results [ORGANIZATION] privacy safeguards with respect to data produced from the indirect estimation of race and ethnicity to ensure that such data is properly identified ifwhen it is shared with facilities.

We received comments on these topics. Comments Many commenters expressed support for stratification by dual eligibility, race, and ethnicity. A few commenters expressed the belief that stratification of quality measures by social risk factors, such as dual eligibility and race and ethnicity, is essential to advancing health equity as such factors have been shown to have a likely impact on health outcomes. A few commenters expressed the belief that stratification will improve transparency, help identify existing disparities and inform efforts to reduce those disparities. A few commenters recommended that [PERSON] take a stepwise approach to stratification. A few commenters stated that stratifying data is important to help identify health equity gaps, but recommended that [PERSON] take action on its findings in order to address the health equity gap and reduce disparities in care. A few commenters recommended that [PERSON] make stratified data publicly available to inform both [PERSON] and stakeholders of the diverse needs of different patient populations, and identify needed policy changes to improve patient access to treatment. A few commenters expressed support for stratification but suggested setting a threshold at the 10th decile of low-income patient distribution to include facilities that serve a disproportionately high percentage of low-income patients. One commenter recommended that adjusting measures for social risk factors, including dual-eligibility or income, may reduce the likelihood of program penalties increasing existing disparities. One commenter supported the proposed stratification of facility-specific reports for [PERSON] measure data by dual-eligibility status and race and ethnicity however, this commenter also recommended [PERSON] monitor for unintended consequences believing that stratification risks disparities in patient treatment. Many commenters expressed support for stratification by dual eligibility. A few commenters supported stratification by dual eligible status, noting that it can be used as a proxy for socio-economic status and is an objective classification that may have less biased data. A few commenters expressed the belief that stratification could help facilities identify and reduce disparities, but noted that differences in ORG13 eligibility between states may impact comparability when stratifying measures by dual eligibility. One commenter expressed concern that dual eligibility may be too blunt a data point to identify the underlying cause of disparity, noting that disparities experienced by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients stem from a wide range of social risk factors. One commenter noted that understanding differences between dual-eligible and non-dual-eligible patients in baseline chronic kidney disease care could inform ways to allocate resources aimed at slowing the progression of C[PERSON]56[LOCATION]18 One commenter noted the correlation between a facilitys dual-eligible patient population and a facilitys payment reduction based on its [PERSON] scores, citing studies indicating that facilities serving a higher proportion of dual eligiblelow-income patients are more likely to have higher [PERSON] payment reductions. Several commenters noted that, although stratification may help identify and address health equity gaps, many disparities begin [ORGANIZATION]80 prior to starting dialysis, and encouraged [PERSON] to explore ways to address health disparities earlier in the progression of kidney disease. One commenter expressed concern that stratification may create unintended consequences such as disparities in patient treatment based on social determinants of health. One commenter recommended [PERSON] consider options beyond stratification of [PERSON] measures by dual eligible status or race and ethnicity to address health equity gaps. One commenter expressed its belief that the segmentation of populations using dual eligibility or race and ethnicity as the proxy for social risk, for example, is problematic and that the primary goal across all [PERSON] programs should be to prioritize self-reported race, ethnicity, and other social determinants of health data as the sole source of stratifying populations to understand disparities. Many commenters expressed support for stratification of measures by race and ethnicity, noting that such factors have been identified as likely having an impact on health outcomes. A few commenters expressed support for the use of indirect estimation of race and ethnicity for purposes of calculating facility level performance measures as a preliminary step while more precise methods are developed. One commenter expressed support for the expansion of [PERSON] Disparity Methods to [ORGANIZATION] and stratifying by race and ethnicity, both within and across facilities. One commenter recommended that disparities methods should be implemented in a [STREET] that is minimally burdensome and confidentially reported. A few commenters requested clarification regarding the application of disparity methods to [ORGANIZATION], noting that disparity methods are currently applied to hospital readmissions measures which may be linked to factors outside the facilitys ability to influence. A few commenters expressed concern regarding the indirect estimation of race and ethnicity, believing that it was not worth the increased and unknown risk of bias that it could unintentionally create and recommended that indirect data be evaluated to ensure [PERSON] is not introducing bias into the system or underestimating or overestimating the quality of care for a certain population. A few commenters expressed concern that the imputation method is imprecise, particularly for indigenous and multi-racial patients and recommended that self-reported data was more accurate. One commenter[PERSON] 61935questioned whether either of the two disparities methods would help close the health equity gap, and suggested that [PERSON] consider whether an indirect estimation approach might divert resources away from developing better methods. One commenter recommended a step-wise approach to use the Within [ORGANIZATION] Disparity Method before expanding to apply an [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION] Disparity Method to assess how a facility is addressing equity, as well as to better establish what resources may be required to effectively address equity. Several commenters expressed support for the stratification of the [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] measures by dual-eligibility status and raceethnicity, noting that evidence has indicated disparities may factor into measure performance in other [ORGANIZATION] settings, and that such stratification may inform clinical practices and care. Several commenters suggested that the vascular access measures are appropriate for stratification by dual eligibility and raceethnicity. A few commenters also recommended that these measures be stratified by insurance status at the time of dialysis initiation in order to provide insight into patients abilities to access pre-dialysis care and vascular access placement. A few commenters stated that the [ORGANIZATION] measure is appropriate for potential stratification by dual eligibility status, raceethnicity, as well as geographic area. A few commenters recommended that stratification is adopted for measures where it has been shown, or is clearly suspected based on research from other care settings, that disparities are driving differences in the outcomes being reported. A few commenters expressed the belief that most [PERSON] measures would benefit from stratification. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] encourage all health care providers and organizations to collect and stratify both patient and caregiver data for all measures. A few commenters recommended that [PERSON] develop best practices to ensure the security of data and its utilization, noting the sensitive nature of the data and the importance of gaining beneficiaries trust. A few commenters agreed that data elements should be subject to existing privacy and security requirements, and recommended that [PERSON] establish an open and transparent process to work with [ORGANIZATION] and other stakeholders to develop data options. One commenter expressed its belief in the unassailable importance of privacy safeguards for all uses of sensitive personal information such as race, ethnicity, and other social risk factors and recommended [PERSON] consider using only self-reported data to alleviate risk of misidentification and to promote robust collection of patient-reported information. A few commenters expressed the belief that patient self-reporting is the most appropriate [STREET] to collect social determinants of health data such as race and ethnicity, agreeing with [PERSON] assessment that self-reported patient data is the gold standard. A few commenters noted that one challenge may be that the concept of race is subjective and may be imprecise due to differences in cultural understanding. A few commenters recommended that [PERSON] encourage facilities to collect self-reported race and ethnicity data, as well as establish a timeframe for meeting specific data collection goals including data completeness and accuracy requirements. One commenter noted that many health care organizations are already collecting self-reported demographic information and have been for [DATE]81. One commenter expressed its belief that the primary goal across all [PERSON] programs should be to prioritize self-reported race, ethnicity, and other social determinants of health data as the sole source of stratifying populations to understand disparities. One commenter recommended that, given the importance of self-reported data, [PERSON] work on developing data collection language that is more person-centric in order to encourage trust among those patients whose data are being collected. Several commenters expressed support for collecting additional information that will likely impact patient outcomes, such as insurance status at dialysis initiation and geographic area of residence. Several commenters recommended the use of Z-codes or other data sources to collect data to report on factors such as housing insecurity, financial insecurity, caregiver support, mental illness, physical illness, age, education level, transportation insecurity, food insecurity, marital status, violence, safety concerns, and child care. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] adopt a definition of health equity that takes into account the needs of various patient populations and structural issues associated with equity, such as race, ethnicity, sex, [PERSON], language preference, tribal membership, and disability status. A few commenters recommended that [PERSON] work with the kidney care community to develop risk adjusters for measures. A few commenters requested that methodologies use data elements that are available to providers and that calculations can be replicated to promote transparency. A few commenters recommended that [PERSON] also consider eliminating bias in kidney function testing, noting for example that the eGFR test is biased based on racial assumptions and can impact transplant eligibility among [LOCATION] patients. One commenter expressed concern that many approaches based on data-driven technologies are less accessible to vulnerable patient populations and would potentially exacerbate existing inequities. This commenter also noted that smartphone technologies may be more promising as an example of a data-driven technology that does not facilitate exacerbation of health inequities. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate all of the comments and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of the [PERSON] health equity quality measurement efforts. We will continue to take all concerns, comments, and suggestions into account for future development and expansion of our health equity quality measurement efforts.Improving [PERSON] Data Collection Experiences of users of certified health IT regarding local adoption of practices for collection of social, psychological, and behavioral data elements, the perceived value of using these data for improving decision-making and care delivery, and the potential challenges and benefits of collecting more granular, structured demographic information, such as the [ORGANIZATION] amp Ethnicity--[PERSON]1 code system. The possible collection of a minimum set of social, psychological, and behavioral data elements by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities at the time of admission using structured, interoperable electronic data standards, for the purposes of reporting, measure stratification and other data collection efforts relating to quality. We received comments on these topics. Comments Many commenters expressed support for [PERSON] efforts to address inequities in health outcomes through improving data collection and patient outcome measurement. Several commenters supported the use of minimally burdensome data collection efforts. A few commenters noted that much of the information that [PERSON] would like to collect is reported on Form 2[DATE]28--[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Medical Evidence Report [PERSON] Entitlement AndOr [PERSON] [PERSON]1 control number [DATE], and encouraged that [PERSON] to be economical in its expansion of data collection on the Form 2[DATE]28 so as to not create additional patient concerns. One commenter recommended that a system of data[PERSON] 61936collection and reporting should not add to the confusion about what the terms race and ethnicity mean, and what labels appropriately fit either of these broad concepts. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] collect data on demographic characteristics in a [STREET] that aligns with adoption of [PERSON][DATE][DATE] standards, noting that [PERSON][DATE][DATE] may be used to appropriately group demographic characteristics in a standardized [STREET]. One commenter noted the potential challenge of uploading data from facility [PERSON] systems to [PERSON] for measure calculation purposes. A few commenters expressed concerns with adjusting for social factors when there is a small numbers problem in [PERSON] that can impact the accuracy of performance measurement and that will be aggravated with dividing categories into smaller subsets. One commenter expressed its belief that modifications to current data collection related to social, psychological, and behavioral data could be useful to [PERSON] to address equity and quality of care. PERSON8wever, the commenter did not recommend the application of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]9 900-variable system of identifying race and ethnicity, as provided in the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]9 [ORGANIZATION] and Ethnicity Code Set Version 1.0, in a highly granular [STREET] believing the volume of data that would need to be collected would make the process labor intensive for clinical staff. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] work to improve and standardize the underlying data collection and metrics this commenter recommended a joint development process that includes [ORGANIZATION] amp ORG13 Innovation [PERSON]43 and [PERSON]42 [PERSON]1[DATE] in collaboration with health systems, practices, and patientcommunity representation. Other commenters noted the importance of closing the health equity gap through measurement of demographic characteristics. One commenter suggested that agencies leverage the role of social workers in identifying sociodemographic factors and barriers to health equity. Another commenter supported this method, noting that although this may add another step to data collection processes, it would be valuable in addressing health equity gaps. To reduce possible workload burden on organizations that are new to this process, a commenter recommended a gradual approach to data collection. In addition, commenters suggested reducing burden by adopting standardized screening tools to collect this information, such as ICD-10-[ORGANIZATION] Z-codes, which in practice would allow patients to be referred to resources and initiatives when appropriate. Several commenters encouraged collection of comprehensive social determinants of health and demographic information in addition to race and ethnicity, such as disability, sexual orientation, and primary language. Several commenters provided feedback on the potential use of an indirect estimation algorithm when race and ethnicity are missing or incorrect, and emphasized the sensitivity of demographic information and recommended that [PERSON] use caution when using estimates from the algorithm, including assessing for potential bias, reporting the results of indirect estimation alongside direct self-report at the organizational level for comparison, and establishing a timeline to transition to entirely directly collected data. Commenters also advised that [PERSON] be transparent with beneficiaries and explain why data are being collected and the plans to use these data. A commenter noted that information technology infrastructure should be established in advance to ensure that this information is being used and exchanged appropriately. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate all of the comments and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of the [PERSON] health equity quality measurement efforts.

Interventions [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities could institute to improve a low facility equity score and how improved demographic data could assist with these efforts. We received comments on these topics. Comments Several commenters expressed support for the concept of an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] Equity Score, but requested that [PERSON] provide further details. Several commenters recommended that [PERSON] work with stakeholders in the kidney care community to develop an equity score in order to ensure transparency and to make sure providers are able to address identified inequities. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] include education, training, and resources for implementation of an equity score. A few commenters noted the challenge of developing a scoring methodology that could address risk across different factors. A few commenters questioned whether the score would be meaningful for patients. A few commenters expressed concern for public reporting of a [ORGANIZATION] Equity Score, noting that it might be misleading to patients and may not reflect quality of care because facilities are limited in their ability to influence disparities that impact health outcomes. One commenter expressed the belief that a [ORGANIZATION] Equity Score is premature, and that [PERSON] should focus on establishing the right set of patient characteristics and contrasting them with meaningful clinical and consumer measures in order to develop a meaningful scoring methodology to propose in future notice and comment rulemaking. One commenter expressed caution that the component measures should reflect actual differences in care provided by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities and not factors outside of those facilities control, believing the inclusion of measures not much under the control of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities will penalize those facilities serving a large number of vulnerable patients and not really speak to issues of equity in the care provided. This commenter recommended that measures are selected carefully to reflect activities and factors that are under facilities control and then apply all of the standard tools of quality improvement. One commenter expressed its belief that the use of an imputed raceethnicity methodology risks misattributing people to the wrong categories, and carrying that over into a facility equity score could lead to incorrect or misguided responses. This commenter recommended a careful, inclusive development process to avoid establishing processes and metrics that exacerbate harms and recommended a [PERSON]43 initiative to test and shape reporting. A few commenters expressed support for the production of reports to help facilities, patients and payers understand the disparities in their patient populations. A few commenters noted that many barriers such as anti-kickback rules and other regulations prevent facilities from providing additional services and supports that would help to address health disparities, and recommended that [PERSON] work to find ways to remove these barriers. A few commenters recommended that [PERSON] provide support to facilities in order to help them close gaps in health equity. One[PERSON] 6193[DATE]commenter recommended that additional resources be allocated to help assist and support facilities in their health equity goals, such as taking money from [PERSON] penalties to reward facilities that attain the benchmarks and also allocate funds to help low performing facilities improve. One commenter noted that anything that requires additional staff time and effort without either additional payment or some tangible savings elsewhere, will not be sustainable. This commenter gave examples of care coordination, more time in patient education, more frequent patient home visits, and additional electronic home monitoring, as potential paths to equity improvement that require additional funding. We appreciate all of the comments and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of the [PERSON] health equity quality measurement efforts. We will continue to take all concerns, comments, and suggestions into account for future development and expansion of our health equity quality measurement efforts. We also received comments on the general topic of health equity in [ORGANIZATION]. Comments Many commenters expressed overall support of [PERSON] goals to advance health equity. There were a few comments regarding the need to further extend and specify the definition of equity provided in the proposed rule. Commenters also noted that equity initiatives should be based on existing disparities and population health goals, be mindful of the needs of the communities served, and work to bridge dialysis facilities with community-based providers. Several commenters recommended that [PERSON] further investigate ways to provide outreach and education aimed at slowing down the progress of chronic kidney disease and address health disparities before dialysis is necessary. Several commenters encouraged [PERSON] to be mindful about whether collection of additional quality measures and standardized patient assessment elements might increase provider burden. We appreciate all of the comments and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of the [PERSON] health equity quality measurement efforts. We will continue to take all concerns, comments, and suggestions into account for future development.2. [ORGANIZATION] Vaccination Measures Request for [LOCATION].

[ORGANIZATION] Vaccination Coverage Among [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]8 Personnel [PERSON]56 Measure In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], we stated our belief that it is important to incentivize and track [PERSON]56 vaccination in dialysis facilities through quality measurement in order to protect health care workers, patients, and caregivers, and to help sustain the ability of these facilities to[PERSON] 61939continue serving their communities throughout the [PERSON]65 and beyond. We recognize the importance of [ORGANIZATION] vaccination, and have finalized proposals to include a [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]56 vaccination measure in various pay for reporting programs, such as the Inpatient Psychiatric [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Reporting [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] FR [ZIP] through [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] Inpatient [PERSON]58uality Reporting [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] FR 453[DATE]4 through [DATE], the [ORGANIZATION]-Exempt Cancer PERSON8spital [PERSON]58uality Reporting PCH[PERSON]58R [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] FR [ZIP] through [DATE], the [ORGANIZATION]ong-Term Care PERSON8spital [PERSON]58uality Reporting [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]TCH [PERSON]58RP [DATE] FR [ZIP] through [ZIP], the Inpatient Rehabilitation [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Reporting [ORGANIZATION] I[PERSON] [PERSON]58RP [DATE] FR [ZIP] through [ZIP], and the Skilled Nursing [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Reporting [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] FR [ZIP] through [ZIP]. In the proposed rule, we noted that there is not a pay for reporting program under the [ORGANIZATION], however, we stated our belief that the public reporting of vaccination data on [PERSON]8 is important and would help to inform patients of a facilitys [ORGANIZATION] vaccination rates of [PERSON]56. Currently, there is a measure for [PERSON]56 234 and another for patient [ORGANIZATION] vaccination 235 rates and such measures are currently reported to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]9 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5 via [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Networks. The two measures track the proportions of a facilitys [PERSON]56 and patient population, respectively, that have been fully vaccinated against [ORGANIZATION]. Facilities were able to begin [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION] vaccination reporting for [PERSON]56 in [DATE] [ORGANIZATION],236 and were able to begin [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION] vaccination reporting for patients in [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]8.23[DATE] When the proposed rule was published, we noted that 89 percent of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities were reporting [PERSON]56 vaccination rates and almost 95 percent of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities were reporting patient vaccination rates on these measures. In the proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], we stated that we were evaluating options for publicly reporting the data on official [PERSON] datasets that compare the quality of care provided in [PERSON]-certified dialysis facilities nationwide. We further stated that we were also exploring the potential future inclusion of a [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measure to [ORGANIZATION]. Therefore, we sought public comment on adding a new measure, [ORGANIZATION] Vaccination Coverage Among [PERSON]56, to [ORGANIZATION] measure set in the next rulemaking cycle. The measure would assess the proportion of a facilitys health care workforce that has been vaccinated against [ORGANIZATION].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- [DATE] 236 23[DATE] [PERSON]56 are at risk of carrying [ORGANIZATION] infection to patients, experiencing illness or death as a result of [ORGANIZATION] themselves, and transmitting it to their families, friends, and the general public. In the proposed rule [DATE] FR [ZIP], we stated our belief that facilities should track the level of vaccination among their [PERSON]56 as part of their efforts to assess and reduce the risk of transmission of [ORGANIZATION] within their facilities. [PERSON]56 vaccination can potentially reduce illness that leads to work absence and limit disruptions to care.238 Data from influenza vaccination demonstrates that provider uptake of the vaccine is associated with that provider recommending vaccination to patients,239 and we stated our belief that [PERSON]56 [ORGANIZATION] vaccination in dialysis facilities could similarly increase uptake among that patient population. We also stated our belief that publishing the [PERSON]56 vaccination rates would be helpful to many patients, including those who are at high-risk for developing serious complications from [ORGANIZATION], as they choose facilities from which to seek treatment. Under [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] Framework, the [ORGANIZATION] measure would address the quality priority of [ORGANIZATION] through [ORGANIZATION] Care.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 238 [PERSON]46.

[ORGANIZATION] can cause outbreaks in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities, and may disproportionately affect [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients due to the nature of the treatment and sharing of common spaces.240 Many patients treated in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities have other underlying chronic conditions, and therefore are highly susceptible to illness and disease.241 Sufficient vaccination coverage among patients in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities may reduce transmission of [ORGANIZATION], thereby protecting them from [ORGANIZATION] mortality. Therefore, we sought public comment on adding new measure, [ORGANIZATION] Vaccination Coverage Among [PERSON]s, to [ORGANIZATION] measure set in future rulemaking. The measure would assess the proportion of a facilitys patient population that has been vaccinated against [ORGANIZATION].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 240 [LOCATION]00, [PERSON], [LOCATION]01, [PERSON], Tio, M., [LOCATION]02, GPE13, Caring for Dialysis [PERSON]s in a Time of [ORGANIZATION].

Under [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] Framework, the [ORGANIZATION] measure addresses the quality priority of [ORGANIZATION] through [ORGANIZATION] Care.d. Review by [PERSON]68 and [ORGANIZATION] The [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]56 vaccination measure and the [ORGANIZATION] patient vaccination measure were included on the publicly available PERSON45st of Measures under Consideration for [DATE] 21, [ORGANIZATION] MUC PERSON45st, a list of measures under consideration for use in various [PERSON] programs.242 When [ORGANIZATION] PERSON8spital [ORGANIZATION] convened on [PERSON]95anuary 11, [ORGANIZATION]8, it reviewed measures on the MUC PERSON45st including the two [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures. The [PERSON][DATE]0 PERSON8spital [ORGANIZATION] recognized that the proposed measures represent a promising effort to advance measurement for an evolving national pandemic and that it would bring value to [ORGANIZATION] measure set by[PERSON] 61940providing transparency about an important [ORGANIZATION] intervention to help prevent infections in [PERSON]56 and patients.243 The [PERSON][DATE]0 PERSON8spital [ORGANIZATION] also stated that collecting information on [ORGANIZATION] vaccination coverage among [PERSON]56 and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients, and providing feedback to facilities, will allow facilities to benchmark coverage rates and improve coverage in their facility. The [PERSON][DATE]0 PERSON8spital [ORGANIZATION] further noted that reducing rates of [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]56 and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients may reduce transmission among a patient population that is highly susceptible to illness and disease, and also reduce instances of staff shortages due to illness.244--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 242 [PERSON]9.

In the [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION]8 [PERSON][DATE]0 Final [PERSON], [PERSON][DATE]0 offered conditional support for rulemaking contingent on [PERSON] bringing the measures back to [PERSON][DATE]0 once the specifications are further refined.24[DATE] The [PERSON][DATE]0 specifically stated, the incomplete specifications require immediate mitigation and further development should continue. 248 The [PERSON][DATE]0 further noted that the measures would add value to [ORGANIZATION] measure set by providing visibility into an important intervention to limit [ORGANIZATION] infections in [PERSON]56 and the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients for whom they provide care.249 [PERSON] brought both measures back to [ORGANIZATION] on [DATE] 15, [ORGANIZATION]8 to provide additional information and continue discussing mitigation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- [PERSON].

Accessed on [DATE] 23, [ORGANIZATION]8 at [ORGANIZATION] In the proposed rule, we sought public comment on potentially adding the two new [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures discussed above, the [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measure for [PERSON]56 and the [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measure for patients, to [ORGANIZATION] measure set.250--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 250 Specifications for both measures available at We were also interested in public comment on data collection, submission, and reporting for the [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measure for [PERSON]56 and the [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measure for patients. For example, we stated that we were considering requiring reporting for these measures on an [ORGANIZATION]1 basis for the performance period for each [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]28 corresponding to the associated payment [ORGANIZATION]20, and the reporting period would be [PERSON]95anuary 1 through [DATE] [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]1ly. Based on the measures currently being developed by the [PERSON]1 that were submitted to [ORGANIZATION], facilities would report the measures through the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] web-based surveillance system. We also sought public comment from stakeholders on other ways to collect data on [ORGANIZATION] vaccination rates at dialysis facilities for [PERSON] purposes and their associated costs and burdens. Given the immediacy of the [PERSON]65 for [ORGANIZATION], as well as the importance of continuing to monitor and make publicly available [ORGANIZATION] vaccination rates as the [PERSON]65 ends, we stated that we anticipate rulemaking on this requirement in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]19 rulemaking cycle. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for future adoption of both [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures. Several commenters expressed the belief that [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures are important because they would help to prevent the spread of [ORGANIZATION] in a facility and would also help to prevent mortality due to the impact of [ORGANIZATION] on an immunocompromised patient population. A few commenters stated that such measures would help encourage [ORGANIZATION] vaccination for both staff and patients at [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities. One commenter noted that the nature of treatment sessions in the dialysis care setting may make other [ORGANIZATION] mitigation strategies less effective. A few commenters expressed support for the possible adoption of both [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures, noting that making such data publicly available would help patients make informed choices. A few commenters expressed support for reporting possible [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures through [ORGANIZATION] as it already does so and therefore would be less burdensome. Several commenters expressed support for tracking and reporting [ORGANIZATION] vaccination rates among [PERSON]56s and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients on [PERSON]40 or [PERSON]8 in order to help patients make informed decisions when choosing a dialysis facility. One commenter expressed support the application of a uniform reporting metric for [ORGANIZATION] vaccination among [PERSON]56s and patients across all [PERSON]-covered health settings. A few commenters expressed support for all efforts to increase vaccination coverage among [PERSON]56s for their own safety and for patient safety as well. One commenter expressed its belief that all medically-eligible [PERSON]56s should be vaccinated against [ORGANIZATION]. A few commenters expressed support for the [ORGANIZATION] Vaccination among [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients measure. One commenter expressed the belief that it may be useful for the public to know the percent of patients vaccinated at a facility. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their support, and will take commenters feedback into consideration for future rulemaking. Comment Although several commenters expressed support for vaccination efforts and the belief that patients and [PERSON]56s should follow [PERSON]1 vaccination guidelines, these commenters did not support the inclusion of [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures in [ORGANIZATION]. A few commenters recommended that [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures should not be added to [ORGANIZATION], noting the [ORGANIZATION]s initial hesitancy to recommend the measures. A few commenters expressed the belief that such measures would not help to address vaccine hesitancy among patients and [PERSON]56s, and suggested that [PERSON]11 agencies[PERSON] 61941coordinate vaccination education and outreach efforts instead. A few commenters expressed concern that including [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures in [ORGANIZATION] would hold facilities accountable for vaccination rates of patients and [PERSON]56s, noting that the individual decision to get vaccinated is beyond the facilitys control. One commenter recommended that such measures incorporate factors that take into account facility vaccination efforts, rather than a numeric threshold. One commenter expressed support for including the [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures as performance measures in [ORGANIZATION]. One commenter recommended that such measures be included in [ORGANIZATION] as reporting measures. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their feedback, and will take this input into consideration for future rulemaking. We note that the [ORGANIZATION] now recommends both [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures for inclusion in [ORGANIZATION].251 We also note that the [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures that we describe in this final rule and are considering for adoption in future rulemaking would be reporting measures. Under these measures, facilities would only be required to report vaccination rates and would not be penalized based on the vaccination rates themselves.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 251 [PERSON][DATE]0. [ORGANIZATION]-[ORGANIZATION]8 [ORGANIZATION] Final [PERSON]. Accessed on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]8 at Comment Several commenters expressed concern that establishing the specifications for such measures would be challenging due to changing [ORGANIZATION] vaccination guidelines and differences in regional policies, which may undermine the validity or reliability of a [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measure. A few commenters requested that [PERSON] provide more specific details regarding proposed vaccination measure specifications, including defined numerators and denominators, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria. A few commenters expressed concern that defining the denominator for the [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]56 Vaccination measure will be challenging because many [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities are parts of larger organizations and may share staff who spend some time working in the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] unit or facility and time working elsewhere. One commenter requested that the possible [ORGANIZATION] Vaccination among [PERSON]56 measure limit data collection to [PERSON]56s employed by the dialysis organizations and only require the reporting of information within the facilities purview, noting that the [PERSON]1 is able to obtain non-clinic staff information directly from providers. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for their feedback, and will take this input into consideration for future rulemaking. We acknowledge that measure specifications may evolve based on changes to [ORGANIZATION] vaccination guidelines, and would provide more specific details regarding measure specifications in future rulemaking as part of our proposals to adopt the [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measures. Comment A few commenters expressed concern that implementing such measures would result in staff quitting in order to avoid vaccination, which would in turn negatively impact patient care. [ORGANIZATION] We acknowledge that staffing shortages are a national issue, especially for the [ORGANIZATION] system. PERSON8wever, we disagree that staffing shortages would impact patient safety more than unvaccinated [PERSON]56s. We believe that vaccination is one of the most effective tools right now for protecting an immunocompromised patient population that has particularly high mortality rates due to [ORGANIZATION] infection. We also note that the [ORGANIZATION] Vaccination among [PERSON]56 measure that we are considering for future adoption would not require vaccination, but would rather require facilities to report vaccination rates. Comment One commenter recommended that patients such as children [DATE]29 who are not yet eligible for vaccination under an [ORGANIZATION] or approval should be excluded from any vaccination measure. [ORGANIZATION] The current [ORGANIZATION] Vaccination among [PERSON]s measure being considered for possible adoption in future rulemaking excludes patients who are ineligible for vaccination. Comment A few commenters did not support the future inclusion of a [ORGANIZATION] Vaccination among [PERSON]s measure. One commenter acknowledged that a [ORGANIZATION] patient vaccination measure likely would marginally increase and sustain vaccination rates, but expressed concern that tying a [ORGANIZATION] patient vaccination measure to payment may have unintended consequences such as undermining patient autonomy and creating barriers to facility access for unvaccinated patients. One commenter did not support the [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measure for patients believing there is no point to collecting data that mostly reflects patient demographics based on vaccination status, not clinical quality. This commenter stated its belief that providers are already motivated to ensure their patients are vaccinated given the high [ORGANIZATION] mortality rate among [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] patients. [ORGANIZATION] The [ORGANIZATION] patient vaccination measure that we are considering for adoption in future rulemaking is a reporting measure facilities would only be required to report vaccination rates and would not be penalized based on actual vaccination rates. We agree that the [ORGANIZATION] vaccination measure for patients would collect data that indicates patient vaccination rates at an individual facility. PERSON8wever, we also believe that this measure would motivate providers to ensure their patients are vaccinated against [ORGANIZATION] and that this information is also relevant to patient safety since a facilitys vaccination rates would be important for patients to know when choosing an individual facility for treatment.3. Advancing to [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Measurement and the Use of Fast [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]8 Interoperability Resources [PERSON][DATE][DATE] We aim to move fully to digital quality measurement in [PERSON] quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. As part of this modernization of our quality measurement enterprise, we issued a request for information [ORGANIZATION]. The purpose of this [ORGANIZATION] was to gather broad public input solely for planning purposes for our transition to digital quality measurement. Any updates to specific program requirements related to providing data for quality measurement and reporting provisions would be addressed through future rulemaking, as necessary. This [ORGANIZATION] contained four parts [LOCATION]. This part provided information on our quality measurement programs and our goal to move fully to digital quality measurement by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. This part also provided a summary of other recent [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 policy developments that are advancing interoperability and could support our move towards full digital quality measurement. Definition of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Measures d[PERSON]58Ms. This part provided a potential definition for d[PERSON]58Ms. Specific requests for input are included in the section. PERSON4ges Under Consideration to Advance [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Measurement [ORGANIZATION]ions in Four Areas to Transition to [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Measures by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. This part introduced four possible steps that would enable transformation of [PERSON] quality measurement enterprise to be[PERSON] 61942fully digital by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. Specific requests for input are included in the section. Solicitation of Comments. This part listed all requests for input included in the above sections of this [ORGANIZATION].a. [LOCATION] As required by law, we implemented quality measurement programs and value-based purchasing programs across a broad range of inpatient, outpatient, and post-acute care [ORGANIZATION] settings, consistent with our mission to improve the quality of health care for Americans through measurement, transparency, and increasingly, value-based purchasing. These quality programs are foundational for incentivizing value-based care, contributing to improvements in health care, enhancing patient outcomes, and informing consumer choice. We aim to move fully to digital quality measurement by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. We acknowledge providers within the various care and practice settings covered by our quality programs may be at different stages of readiness, and therefore, the timeline for achieving full digital quality measurement across our quality reporting programs may vary. We also continue to evolve the [PERSON] Promoting Interoperability [ORGANIZATION] that advances the use of certified electronic health record [ORGANIZATION] technology, from an initial focus on electronic data capture to enhancing information exchange and expanding quality measurement 83 FR [ZIP]. PERSON8wever, reporting quality data via [ORGANIZATION]s remains burdensome, and our current approach to quality measurement does not readily incorporate emerging data sources such as patient-reported outcomes PRO and patient-generated health data PGH[LOCATION]182[DATE] There is a need to streamline our approach to data collection, calculation, and reporting to fully leverage clinical and patient-centered information for measurement, improvement, and learning.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2[DATE] What are patient generated health data Additionally, advancements in technical standards and regulatory initiatives to improve interoperability of [ORGANIZATION] data are creating an opportunity to significantly improve our quality measurement systems. In May [ORGANIZATION], we finalized interoperability requirements in the [PERSON] Interoperability and [PERSON] Access final rule 85 FR [ZIP] to support beneficiary access to data held by certain payers. At the same time, [PERSON]42 [PERSON]1[DATE] finalized policies in the [PERSON]1[DATE] 21st Century Cures [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR [ZIP] to advance the interoperability of health IT as defined in section 4003 of the Cures [ORGANIZATION], including the complete access, exchange, and use of all electronically accessible health information. Closely working with [PERSON]1[DATE], we collaboratively identified H[ORGANIZATION][DATE] Fast [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]8 Interoperability Resources [PERSON][DATE][DATE]supreg Release 4.0.1 as the standard to support Application [ORGANIZATION]ming Interface [PERSON][DATE] policies in both rules. [PERSON]1[DATE], on behalf of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0, adopted the H[ORGANIZATION][DATE] [PERSON][DATE][DATE] Release 4.0.1 for [PERSON][DATE]s and related implementation specifications at 45 [ORGANIZATION] 1[DATE]0.215 We believe the [PERSON][DATE][DATE] standard has the potential to be a more efficient and modular standard to enable [PERSON][DATE]s. We also believe this standard enables collaboration and information sharing, which is essential for delivering high-quality care and better outcomes at a lower cost. By aligning technology requirements for payers, health care providers, and health IT developers, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 can advance-an interoperable health IT infrastructure that ensures providers and patients have access to health data when and where it is needed. In the [PERSON]1[DATE] 21st Century Cures [ORGANIZATION] final rule [PERSON]1[DATE] adopted a Standardized [PERSON][DATE] for [PERSON] and Population Services certification criterion for health IT that requires the use of the [PERSON][DATE][DATE] Release 4 and several implementation specifications. Health IT certified to this criterion will offer single patient and multiple patient services that can be accessed by third party applications 85 FR 25[DATE]42.253 The [PERSON]1[DATE] 21st Century Cures [ORGANIZATION] final rule also requires health IT developers update their certified health IT to support the [PERSON] Core Data for Interoperability GPE2[DATE]CDI standard.254 The scope of patient data identified in the GPE2[DATE]CDI and the data standards that support this data set are expected to evolve over time, starting with data specified in Version 1 of the GPE2[DATE]CDI. In [DATE] [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]1[DATE] issued an interim final rule with comment period extending the date when health IT developers must make technology meeting updated certification criteria available under the [PERSON]1[DATE] Health IT Certification [ORGANIZATION] until [DATE] [DATE], [DATE]1 85 FR [DATE]0064.255--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 253 Application [ORGANIZATION]ming Interfaces [PERSON][DATE] Resource Guide, [ORGANIZATION] at 254 255 Information Blocking and the [PERSON]1[DATE] Health IT Certification [ORGANIZATION] Extension of Compliance Dates and Timeframes in [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION]. The [PERSON] Interoperability and [PERSON] Access final rule 85 FR [ZIP] and program policies build on the [PERSON]1[DATE] 21st Century Cures [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR [ZIP]. The [PERSON] Interoperability and [PERSON] Access final rule and policies require certain payers for example, [PERSON] Advantage organizations, ORG13, and [PERSON][DATE]4 fee for service programs, ORG13 managed care plans, [PERSON][DATE]4 managed care entities, and [PERSON]58ualified Health Plan [PERSON]58HP issuers on the [PERSON]11ly-facilitated Exchanges FFEs to implement and maintain a standards-based [PERSON] Access [PERSON][DATE] using H[ORGANIZATION][DATE] [PERSON][DATE][DATE] Release 4.0.1 to make available certain data to their enrollees and beneficiaries called patients in the [PERSON] interoperability rule. These certain data include data concerning claims and encounters, with the intent to ensure access to their own health care information through third-party software applications. The rule also established new Conditions of Participation for [PERSON] and ORG13 participating hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and critical access hospitals CAHs, requiring them to send electronic notifications to another [ORGANIZATION] facility or community provider or practitioner when a patient is admitted, discharged, or transferred 85 FR [ZIP]. In the [ORGANIZATION]5 Physician Fee Schedule PFS final rule 85 FR 844[DATE]2, we finalized a policy to align the certified [ORGANIZATION] technology required for use in the Promoting Interoperability programs and the [PERSON][DATE]6 Promoting Interoperability performance category with the updates to health IT certification criteria finalized in the [PERSON]1[DATE] 21st Century Cures [ORGANIZATION]. Under this policy, eligible clinicians, [PERSON][DATE]6 eligible clinicians, and eligible hospitals and CAHs participating in [PERSON][DATE]8, must use technology meeting the updated certification criteria for performance and reporting periods beginning in [ORGANIZATION]19 85 FR [ZIP]. The use of [PERSON][DATE]s can also reduce long-standing barriers to quality measurement. Currently, health IT developers are required to implement individual measure specifications within their health IT product. The health IT developer must also accommodate how that product connects with the unique variety of systems within a specific care setting.256[PERSON] 61943This may be further complicated by systems which integrate a wide range of data schemas. This process is burdensome and costly, and it is difficult to reliably obtain high quality data across systems. As health IT developers map their health IT data to the [PERSON][DATE][DATE] standard and related implementation specifications, [PERSON][DATE]s can enable these data to be easily accessible for measurement or other use cases, such as care coordination, clinical decision support, and supporting patient access.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 256 [PERSON]13, Strategy on Reducing Regulatory and Administrative Burden Relating to the Use of Health IT and [ORGANIZATION]s, [ORGANIZATION] Feb. [ORGANIZATION]. Available at We believe the emerging data standardization and interoperability enabled by [PERSON][DATE]s will support the transition to full digital quality measurement by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1, and are committed to exploring and seeking input on potential solutions for the transition to digital quality measurement as described in this [ORGANIZATION].b. Definition of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Measures In the proposed rule, we sought to refine the definition of digital quality measures d[PERSON]58Ms to further operationalize our objective of fully transitioning to d[PERSON]58Ms by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. We previously noted d[PERSON]58Ms use sources of health information that are captured and can be transmitted electronically and via interoperable systems 85 FR [ZIP]. In this [ORGANIZATION], we sought input on future elaboration that would define a d[PERSON]58M as a software that processes digital data to produce a measure score or measure scores. Data sources for d[PERSON]58Ms may include administrative systems, electronically submitted clinical assessment data, case management systems, [ORGANIZATION]s, instruments for example, medical devices and wearable devices, patient portals or applications for example, for collection of patient-generated health data, health information exchanges [ORGANIZATION]s or registries, and other sources. We also noted that d[PERSON]58Ms are intended to improve the patient experience including quality of care, improve the health of populations, andor reduce costs. We discuss one potential approach to developing d[PERSON]58M software in section I[LOCATION][PERSON]3.c of this final rule. In this section, we sought comment on the potential definition of d[PERSON]58Ms in this [ORGANIZATION]. We also sought feedback on how leveraging advances in technology for example, [PERSON][DATE][DATE] [PERSON][DATE]s to access and electronically transmit interoperable data for d[PERSON]58Ms could reinforce other activities to support quality measurement and improvement for example, the aggregation of data across multiple data sources, rapid-cycle feedback, and alignment of programmatic requirements. The transition to d[PERSON]58Ms relies on advances in data standardization and interoperability. As providers and payers work to implement the required advances in interoperability over the next several [DATE]81, we will continue to support reporting of eC[PERSON]58Ms through [PERSON] quality reporting programs and through the Promoting Interoperability programs.25[DATE] These fully digital measures continue to be important drivers of interoperability advancement and learning. We are currently re-specifying and testing these measures to use [PERSON][DATE][DATE] rather than the currently adopted [PERSON]58uality Data Model [PERSON]58DM in anticipation of the wider use of [PERSON][DATE][DATE] standards. We intend to apply significant components of the output of this work, such as the re-specified measure logic and the learning done through measure testing with [PERSON][DATE][DATE] [PERSON][DATE]s, to define and build future d[PERSON]58Ms that take advantage of the expansion of standardized, interoperable data.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 25[DATE] eC[PERSON]58I [INSTITUTION], PERSON4ges Under Consideration To Advance [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Measurement Potential [ORGANIZATION]ions in Four Areas To Transition to [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Measures by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1 Building on the advances in interoperability and learning from testing of [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-converted eC[PERSON]58Ms, we aim to move fully to d[PERSON]58Ms, originating from sources of health information that are captured and can be transmitted electronically via interoperable systems, by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. To enable this transformation, we are considering further modernizing the quality measurement enterprise in four major ways 1 [ORGANIZATION]everage and advance standards for digital data and obtain all [ORGANIZATION] data required for quality measures via provider [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-based [PERSON][DATE]s 2 redesign our quality measures to be self-contained tools 3 better support data aggregation and 4 work to align measure requirements across our reporting programs, other [PERSON]11 programs and agencies, and the private sector where appropriate. These changes would enable us to collect and utilize more timely, actionable, and standardized data from diverse sources and care settings to improve the scope and quality of data used in quality reporting and payment programs, reduce quality reporting burden, and make results available to stakeholders in a rapid-cycle fashion. Data collection and reporting efforts would become more efficient, supported by advances in interoperability and data standardization. Aggregation of data from multiple sources would allow assessments of costs and outcomes to be measured across multiple care settings for an individual patient or clinical conditions. We believe that aggregating data for measurement can incorporate a more holistic assessment of an individuals health and [ORGANIZATION] and produce the rich set of data needed to enable patients and caregivers to make informed decisions by combining data from multiple sources for example, patient reported data, [ORGANIZATION] data, and claims data for measurement. Perhaps most importantly, these steps would help us deliver on the full promise of quality measurement and [STREET] us toward a learning health system that transforms [ORGANIZATION] quality, safety, and coordination and effectively measures and achieves value-based care. The shift from a static to a learning health system hinges on the interoperability of [ORGANIZATION] data, and the use of standardized data. d[PERSON]58Ms would leverage this interoperability to deliver on the promise of a learning health system wherein standards-based data sharing and analysis, rapid-cycle feedback, and quality measurement and incentives are aligned for continuous improvement in patient-centered care. Similarly, standardized, interoperable data used for measurement can also be used for other use cases, such as clinical decision support and care coordination and care decision support, which impacts health care and care quality. We requested comments on four potential future actions that would enable transformation to a fully digital quality measurement enterprise by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1.1 [ORGANIZATION]everaging and Advancing Standards for [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]ing All [ORGANIZATION] Data Required for [PERSON]58uality Measures via Provider [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-Based [PERSON][DATE]s We are considering targeting the data required for our quality measures that utilize [ORGANIZATION] data to be data retrieved via [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-based [PERSON][DATE]s based on standardized, interoperable data. Utilizing standardized data for [ORGANIZATION]-based measurement based on [PERSON][DATE][DATE] and associated implementation guides and aligning where possible with interoperability requirements can eliminate the data collection burden providers currently experience with required chart-abstracted quality measures and reduce the burden of reporting digital quality measure results. We can fully leverage this advance to adapt eC[PERSON]58Ms and expand to other[PERSON] 61944d[PERSON]58Ms through the adoption of interoperable standards across other digital data sources. We are considering methods and approaches to leverage the interoperability data requirements for [PERSON][DATE]s set by the [PERSON]1[DATE] 21st Century Cures [ORGANIZATION] final rule for certified health technology to support modernization of [PERSON] quality measure reporting. As discussed previously, these requirements will be included in certified technology in future [DATE]81 85 FR [ZIP], including availability of data included in the GPE2[DATE]CDI via standards-based [PERSON][DATE]s, and [PERSON] will require clinicians and hospitals participating in [PERSON][DATE]6 and [PERSON][DATE]8, respectively, to transition to use of certified technology updated consistent with the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]56 Cures Edition Update 85 FR [ZIP]. [ORGANIZATION] data used for measurement could expand beyond data captured in traditional clinical settings, administrative claims data, and [ORGANIZATION]s. Many important data sources are not currently captured digitally, such as survey and PGH[LOCATION]18 We intend to work to innovate and broaden the digital data used across the quality measurement enterprise beyond the clinical [ORGANIZATION] and administrative claims. Agreed upon standards for these data, and associated implementation guides will be important for interoperability and quality measurement. We will consider developing clear guidelines and requirements for these digital data that align with interoperability requirements, for example, expressing in standards, exposing via [PERSON][DATE]s, and incentivizing technologies that innovate data capture and interoperability. High quality data are also essential for reliable and valid measurement. Hence, in implementing the shift to capture all clinical [ORGANIZATION] data via [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-based [PERSON][DATE]s, we would support efforts to strengthen and test the quality of the data obtained through [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-based [PERSON][DATE]s for quality measurement. We currently conduct audits of electronic data with functions including checks for data completeness and data accuracy, confirmation of proper data formatting, alignment with standards, and appropriate data cleaning. These functions would continue and be applied to d[PERSON]58Ms and further expanded to automate the manual validation of the data compared to the original data source for example, the medical record where possible. Analytic advancements such as natural language processing, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence, can support this evolution. These techniques can be applied to validating observed patterns in data and inferences or conclusions drawn from associations, as data are received, to ensure high quality data are used for measurement. We sought feedback on the goal of aligning data needed for quality measurement with interoperability requirements and the strengths and limitations of this approach. We also sought feedback on the importance of and approaches to supporting inclusion of [ORGANIZATION] and other currently non-standardized data. We also welcomed comment on approaches for testing data quality and validity.2 Redesigning [PERSON]58uality Measures To Be Self-Contained Tools We are considering approaches for deploying quality measures to take advantage of standardized data and interoperability requirements that have expanded flexibility and functionality compared to [PERSON] current eC[PERSON]58Ms. We are considering defining and developing d[PERSON]58M software as end-to-end measure calculation solutions that retrieve data from primarily [PERSON][DATE][DATE] resources maintained by providers, payers, [PERSON], and others calculate measure scores and produce reports. In general, we believe to optimize the use of standardized and interoperable data, the software solution for d[PERSON]58Ms should do the following Have the flexibility to support calculation of single or multiple quality measures. Perform three functions i [ORGANIZATION] data via automated queries from a broad set of digital data sources initially from [ORGANIZATION]s, and in the future from claims, PRO, and [ORGANIZATION] ii calculate the measure score according to measure logic and iii generate measure score reports. Be compatible with any data source systems that implement standard interoperability requirements. Exist separately from digital data sources and respect the limitations of the functionality of those data sources. Be tested and updated independently of the data source systems. Operate in accordance with health information protection requirements under applicable laws and comply with governance functions for health information exchange. Have the flexibility to be deployed by individual health systems, health IT vendors, data aggregators, and health plans andor run by [PERSON] depending on the program and measure needs and specifications. Be designed to enable easy installation for supplemental uses by medical professionals and other non-technical end-users, such as local calculation of quality measure scores or quality improvement. Have the flexibility to employ current and evolving advanced analytic approaches such as natural language processing. Be designed to support pro-competitive practices for development, maintenance, and implementation and diffusion of quality measurement and related quality improvement and clinical tools through for example the use of open-source core architecture. We sought comment on these suggested functionalities and other additional functionalities that quality measure tools should ideally have particularly in the context of the pending availability of standardized and interoperable data for example, standardized [ORGANIZATION] data available via [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-based [PERSON][DATE]s. We were also interested whether and how this more open, agile strategy may facilitate broader engagement in quality measure development, the use of tools developed for measurement for local quality improvement, andor the application of quality tools for related purposes such as public health or research.3 Building a Pathway to Data Aggregation in Support of [PERSON]58uality Measurement Using multiple sources of collected data to inform measurement would reduce data fragmentation or, different pieces of data regarding a single patient stored in many different places. Additionally, we are also considering expanding and establishing policies and processes for data aggregation and measure calculation by third-party aggregators that include, but are not limited to, [ORGANIZATION]s and clinical registries. [PERSON]58ualified Clinical Data Registries and [PERSON]58ualified Registries that report quality measures for eligible clinicians in the [ORGANIZATION]-based Incentive Payment System [PERSON][DATE]6 program are potential examples 258 at 42 [ORGANIZATION] 414.1440b2iv and v and [ORGANIZATION]. 414.1440c2iii and iv and can also support measure reporting. We are considering establishing similar policies for third-party aggregators to maintain the integrity of our measure reporting process and to encourage market innovation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 258 Calendar Year [ORGANIZATION]5 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule Finalized New and Updated [PERSON]58ualified Clinical Data Registry [PERSON]58CDR and [PERSON]58ualified Registry Policies, We sought feedback on aggregation of data from multiple sources being used[PERSON] 61945to inform measurement. We also sought feedback on the role data aggregators can and should play in [PERSON] quality measure reporting in collaboration with providers, and how we can best facilitate and enable aggregation.4 Potential [ORGANIZATION] Alignment of Measures [ORGANIZATION] Reporting [ORGANIZATION]s, [PERSON]11 and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Agencies, and the Private [ORGANIZATION]tor We are committed to using policy levers and working with stakeholders to solve the issue of interoperable data exchange and to transition to full digital quality measurement. We are considering the future potential development and multi-staged implementation of a common portfolio of d[PERSON]58Ms across our regulated programs, agencies, and private payers. This common portfolio would require alignment of 1 Measure concepts and specifications including narrative statements, measure logic, and value sets, and 2 the individual data elements used to build these measure specifications and calculate the measure logic. Further, the required data elements would be limited to standardized, interoperable data elements to the fullest extent possible hence, part of the alignment strategy will be the consideration and advancement of data standards and implementation guides for key data elements. We would coordinate closely with quality measure developers, [PERSON]11 and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] agencies, and private payers to develop and to maintain a cohesive d[PERSON]58M portfolio that meets our programmatic requirements and that fully aligns across [PERSON]11 and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] agencies and payers to the extent possible. We intend for this coordination to be ongoing and allow for continuous refinement to ensure quality measures remain aligned with evolving [ORGANIZATION] practices and priorities for example, PROs, disparities, care coordination, and track with the transformation of data collection, alignment with health IT module updates including capabilities and standards adopted by [PERSON]1[DATE] for example, standards to enable [PERSON][DATE]s. This coordination would build on the principles outlined in [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]0 National Health [PERSON]58uality Roadmap.259 It would focus on the quality domains of safety, timeliness, efficiency, effectiveness, equitability, and patient-centeredness. It would leverage several existing [PERSON]11 and public-private efforts including our [ORGANIZATION] 2.0 Framework the [PERSON]11 Electronic Health Record Modernization DoDVA the [ORGANIZATION]6s Clinical Decision Support Initiative ORG1[DATE]8s Adapting Clinical Guidelines for the [ORGANIZATION] Age initiative the Core [PERSON]58uality Measure Collaborative, which convenes stakeholders from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], provider organizations, private payers, and consumers and develops consensus on quality measures for provider specialties and the [ORGANIZATION]-convened [PERSON][DATE]0, which recommends measures for use in public payment and reporting programs. We would coordinate with [PERSON]84 ongoing work to advance [PERSON][DATE][DATE] resources in critical areas to support patient care and measurement such as social determinants of health. Through this coordination, we would identify which existing measures could be used or evolved to be used as d[PERSON]58Ms, in recognition of current [ORGANIZATION] practice and priorities.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 259 [ORGANIZATION], National Health [PERSON]58uality Roadmap May [ORGANIZATION]. Available at This multi-stakeholder, joint [PERSON]11 and industry, made possible and enabled by the pending advances towards true interoperability, would yield a significantly improved quality measurement enterprise. The success of the d[PERSON]58M portfolio would be enhanced by the degree to which the measures achieve our programmatic requirements for measures as well as the requirements of other agencies and payers. We sought feedback on initial priority areas for the d[PERSON]58M portfolio given evolving interoperability requirements for example, measurement areas, measure requirements, tools, and data standards. We also sought to identify opportunities to collaborate with other [PERSON]11 agencies, states, and the private sector to adopt standards and technology-driven solutions to address our quality measurement priorities across sectors.d. Solicitation of Comments We plan to continue working with other agencies and stakeholders to coordinate and to inform any potential transition to d[PERSON]58Ms by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. We have summarized the comments to this [ORGANIZATION] below but note that we will not be responding to them in this final rule. We will actively consider all input as we develop future regulatory proposals or future subregulatory policy guidance. Any updates to specific program requirements related to quality measurement and reporting provisions would be addressed through separate and future notice-and-comment rulemaking, as necessary. As noted previously, we sought input on the future development of the following Definition of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Measures We sought feedback on the following as described in section I[LOCATION][PERSON]3.c 2.  Do you have feedback on the d[PERSON]58M definition?  Does this approach to defining and deploying d[PERSON]58Ms to interface with [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-based [PERSON][DATE]s seem promising? We also welcomed more specific comments on the attributes or functions to support such an approach of deploying d[PERSON]58Ms. We received comments on these topics. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposed definition of d[PERSON]58M. Several commenters recommended additional clarity on the proposed definition of d[PERSON]58M, including more detail on what the measures would be, how they differ from current [PERSON] measures, and the sources of data for those measures. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] refine its definition of d[PERSON]58Ms, focus on currently available valid and reliable digital data sources, and set clear and specific parameters for what they expect of dialysis providers during this transition. Several commenters expressed support for transitioning toward interoperability through d[PERSON]58MS to interface with [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-based resources. One commenter noted that [PERSON][DATE][DATE] cannot solve or improve data quality alone without extensive development of [PERSON][DATE][DATE] extensions and profiles noting that many [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]-specific data elements are not part of hospital [ORGANIZATION] systems because they are not part of meaningful use requirements this commenter made recommendations for data elements to be included in future versions of GPE28 Core Data for Interoperability GPE2[DATE]CDI. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] evaluate the progress of developers and providers in adopting [PERSON][DATE][DATE] standards to ensure that the adoption of [PERSON][DATE][DATE] standards is not cost-prohibitive or overly burdensome and that [PERSON] establish a clear timeframe for adoption of [PERSON][DATE][DATE] standards, including a trial or voluntary participation period prior to formal adoption. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] ensure that d[PERSON]58Ms can be linked with patient-level data such as patient experience of care and patient-reported outcomes. One commenter expressed support for [PERSON] approach to defining and deploying d[PERSON]58Ms on [PERSON][DATE][DATE] believing it has the potential to further enhance value-based care that puts patient interests as the focal point. This[PERSON] 61946commenter recommended that implementation of d[PERSON]58Ms be gradual, transparent, and based on robust technology. The commenter also noted its belief that the market of software developers would very quickly be able to respond to the [PERSON] request for d[PERSON]58Ms. One commenter expressed agreement that data sources should include administrative systems, electronically submitted clinical assessment data, case management systems, electronic health records, instruments such as medical devices or wearable devices, patient portals or applications, health information exchanges or registries, and other sources. One commenter recommended that d[PERSON]58Ms be developed using standardized data collection measures that enable end users to interact with quality measures in an interoperable and consistent format and to ensure consistency in the collection and data analysis. This commenter also recommended the use of [ORGANIZATION] on [PERSON][DATE][DATE] apps using a [PERSON][DATE][DATE] [PERSON]58uestionnaire to enable powerful data capture, reduce burden, and that would allow for the continuous data driven development of quality measures over time, with the softwarehardware layers providing greater stability. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] add a digital measure confirming the presence and accessibility of advance directive information. Several commenters expressed concerns about shifting to a [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-based application programming interface including that the utility of an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]-specific [PERSON][DATE][DATE] standard outside of quality reporting to [PERSON] is limited, it introduces complicating factors, the burden may outweigh the benefit with [PERSON] current focus on [PERSON]5 and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, it may not achieve the data flow intended by [PERSON] for the dialysis industry, and that shifting to a new system does not make sense at this time. One commenter expressed caution about the adoption of [PERSON][DATE][DATE] noting that the current [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] quality data submission process captures 90 percent of data electronically and recommended piloting the [PERSON][DATE][DATE] approach to ensure that [PERSON][DATE][DATE] improves quality reporting over and above E[PERSON]58RGPE13 One commenter recommended that [PERSON] consider the burden on facilities related to compliance, noted implementation uncertainties, and recommended [PERSON] allocate resources to help with the transition to new data systems and processes. One commenter expressed concerns with transitioning the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] programs to another platform and recommended that interoperability standards should be incorporated into the E[PERSON]58RGPE13 One commenter recommended that [PERSON] not reinvent the wheel but rather continue to work with the kidney care community to address the next generation of quality and data policies. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate all of the comments on and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of our transition to digital quality measurement in [PERSON] quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. We will continue to take all comments into account as we develop future regulatory proposals or other guidance for our digital quality measurement efforts. PERSON4ges Under Consideration To Advance [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Measurement [ORGANIZATION]ions in Four Areas To Transition to [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Measures by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1  We sought feedback on the following as described in section I[LOCATION][PERSON]3.c 1. of this final rule--Do you agree with the goal of aligning data needed for quality measurement with that required for interoperability? What are the strengths and limitations of this approach?--PERSON8w important is a data standardization approach that also supports inclusion of [ORGANIZATION] and other currently non-standardized data?--What are possible approaches for testing data quality and validity? We received comments on these topics. Comments Several commenters expressed support for the goal of aligning data needed with interoperability. One commenter expressed its belief that quality measurement data must be aligned with and based on tools and methods of interoperability within [ORGANIZATION] believing this is core to the achievement of value-based [ORGANIZATION]. This commenter also noted its belief that aligning the incentives for all major stakeholders in [ORGANIZATION] patients, providers, payers, regulators is key to enabling a robust [ORGANIZATION] system and that when quality is measured according to the patient through the proxy measures of outcomes and cost of care, having data that are interoperable among these stakeholders is crucial. One commenter expressed support conceptually for the goal of aligning data, but needed more clarity on the specific quality measures [PERSON] is considering for these purposes. One commenter recommended approaches for standardization including that [PERSON] develop 1 Standard sets of outcomes measures only utilize validated PROMs as defined by ISO[PERSON]58O[ORGANIZATION] validation guidelines 2 strictly defined standard sets standardized outcome definition including allowed response options, validated PROMs and defined data collection time points ensures consistency in data collection and allow for consistent data quality checks and 3 variables used in standard sets mapped to SNOMED[ORGANIZATION]OINC concepts allow for in-depth data validity audits. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] establish guidance to ensure data security and to define roles and responsibilities regarding data validation and data cleaning. This commenter also noted that data validation and cleaning is currently managed by third party intermediaries and is necessary to maintain measure integrity and for reducing provider burden. One commenter expressed its concerns with standardization including burden on providers and questioned the value of moving from a standardized data format that already serves 90 percent of the dialysis community to an interoperability format that is standardized for data movement between providers beyond the dialysis industry. A few commenters expressed concerns with the inclusion of patient generated health data and other currently non-standardized data into a data standardized approach. One commenter noted that [PERSON] definition of patient gathered health data is overly broad. One commenter expressed its belief that such data elements will vary by therapeutic area and be difficult to standardize. One commenter expressed its belief that additional research is needed prior to integration of patient-generated health data into quality measurement believing that while the data can augment the overall picture of health, it can be full of bias, noise, and variability. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate all of the comments on and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of our transition to digital quality measurement in [PERSON] quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. We will continue to take all comments into account as we develop future regulatory proposals or other guidance for our digital quality measurement efforts.  We sought feedback on the following as described in section I[LOCATION][PERSON]3.c 2. of this final rule--What functionalities, described in section I[LOCATION][PERSON]3.c 2. of this final rule[PERSON] 6194[DATE]or others, should quality measure tools ideally have in the context of the pending availability of standardized and interoperable data for example, standardized [ORGANIZATION] data available via [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-based [PERSON][DATE]s?--PERSON8w would this more open, agile strategy for end-to-end measure calculation facilitate broader engagement in quality measure development, the use of tools developed for measurement for local quality improvement, andor the application of quality tools for related purposes such as public health or research? We received comments on these topics. Comments One commenter recommended common measure sets that gather data based on standard ontologies for example, ICD-10, [ORGANIZATION] believing that the use of resources that enable the use of shareable, digital data need be part of quality measure tools. The commenter also noted that the use of such measure sets, such as ICHOM Standard Sets, are also essential when on [PERSON][DATE][DATE] in a fully interoperable context. One commenter expressed its belief that broader engagement would lead to incremental gains on quality measure development noting that [PERSON] already provides its contracted measure developers with access to the [PERSON]5 and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 data for measure development and to the community via [DATE], an [PERSON]8[DATE] sponsored registry, and noted that [PERSON][DATE][DATE] [PERSON][DATE] may provide these data in a timelier fashion than providing data files. One commenter noted that international experience has shown that open cycle work groups, developed under an agile method, leads to the establishment of value based [ORGANIZATION] in a manner that works best for patient outcomes, and in a manner that develops the standards in a [STREET] that is independent to the payment rate-setting development process, which can lead to better outcomes for patients and better methods for data collection for providers. This commenter also expressed its belief that making measure collection seamless through the use of standard ontologies and [PERSON][DATE][DATE]-based [PERSON][DATE] apps will allow both large scale data collection for use in value-based [ORGANIZATION] initiatives and the local usage of data for improvement of care as well as reducing reporting burden. One commenter expressed concern that the investments and progress the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] community has made to develop the current digital quality framework would be reversed with the adoption of a third new digital quality measurement approach. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate all of the comments on and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of our transition to digital quality measurement in [PERSON] quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. We will continue to take all comments into account as we develop future regulatory proposals or other guidance for our digital quality measurement efforts.  We sought feedback on the following as described in section I[LOCATION][PERSON]3.c 3. of this final rule--Do you have feedback on policy considerations for aggregation of data from multiple sources being used to inform measurement?--Do you have feedback on the role data aggregators can and should play in [PERSON] quality measure reporting in collaboration with providers? PERSON8w can [PERSON] best facilitate and enable aggregation? We received comments on these topics. Comments One commenter expressed support for [PERSON] gathering data from multiple sources to inform quality measurement however, this commenter also expressed caution about the use of [PERSON][DATE][DATE] [PERSON][DATE] as the most appropriate digital data collection method. One commenter expressed its belief that [PERSON] is best served to very early define the format in which they need to have the measures reported and that an open publication of the requested data formats and annotation, for example, a common data model, is the key to initiate a health market adjustment. This commenter recommended that [PERSON] set forth policy that requires the collection of data using standardized measure sets, based on easily collectable data using standard ontologies and [ORGANIZATION] tools, and transported using the [PERSON][DATE][DATE] interoperable transport [PERSON][DATE]. A few commenters expressed their belief that aggregation of data from multiple sources is not an issue for the renal community noting the use of [PERSON]5, [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, and [ORGANIZATION]. A few commenters expressed their concerns with the use of data aggregators. One commenter expressed its concerns that moving to an undefined new standard under [PERSON][DATE][DATE] will require significant additional investments from industry when such investments already have been made to create the highly efficient [ORGANIZATION] and other means of electronic data submission. One commenter expressed its belief that there is no need for data aggregators for the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] quality program because of existing data standardization and availability of required data in provider [PERSON]s or [PERSON] claims data noting the successful ability of 90 percent of the industry to submit data electronically in a standard format via batch, and the remaining 10 percent to do the same via manual interface however, this commenter also noted that if [PERSON] requires data elements that are not able to be collected by dialysis providers then data aggregators may be helpful. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate all of the comments on and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of our transition to digital quality measurement in [PERSON] quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. We will continue to take all comments into account as we develop future regulatory proposals or other guidance for our digital quality measurement efforts.  We sought feedback on the following as described in section I[LOCATION][PERSON]3.c 4. of this final rule--What are initial priority areas for the d[PERSON]58M portfolio for example, measurement areas, measure requirements, tools?--We also sought to identify opportunities to collaborate with other [PERSON]11 agencies, states, and the private sector to adopt standards and technology-driven solutions to address our quality measurement priorities and across sectors. We received comments on these topics. Comments One commenter recommended that the priority areas for the d[PERSON]58M portfolio be around health equity and quality measures for which data supports that additional access to care can improve quality outcomes. A few commenters had recommendations for [PERSON] collaboration related to adopting standards and technology-driven solutions. One commenter recommended opportunities to collaborate with [PERSON]88, [PERSON]46, and [PERSON]89. One commenter recommended collaboration with an objective, independent and patient centered non-profit organization that collaborates with patients and [ORGANIZATION] professionals. One commenter recommended that [PERSON] work with states and other [PERSON]11 agencies who might require these same data elements as an [PERSON][DATE] from [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 then that could create benefit and reduce administrative burden. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate all of the comments on and interest in this topic.[PERSON] 61948We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of our transition to digital quality measurement in [PERSON] quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]1. We will continue to take all comments into account as we develop future regulatory proposals or other guidance for our digital quality measurement efforts.[LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Model[PERSON]1. Overview of [ORGANIZATION] As described in [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR [ZIP], beneficiaries with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] are among the most medically fragile and high-cost populations served by the [PERSON] program. [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] require dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive, and the majority of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] receiving dialysis receive hemodialysis in an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility. PERSON8wever, as described in [ORGANIZATION] final rule, alternative renal replacement modalities to in-center hemodialysis, including home dialysis and kidney transplantation, are associated with improved clinical outcomes, better quality of life, and lower costs than in-center hemodialysis 85 FR [ZIP]. [ORGANIZATION]tion [DATE] of the [ORGANIZATION] authorizes [PERSON]90 to test innovative payment and service delivery models expected to reduce [PERSON], ORG13, and [PERSON][DATE]4 expenditures while preserving or enhancing the quality of care furnished to such programs beneficiaries. The purpose of [ORGANIZATION] is to test the effectiveness of adjusting certain [PERSON] payments to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities and [PERSON]93 to encourage greater utilization of home dialysis and kidney transplantation, support beneficiary modality choice, reduce [PERSON] expenditures, and preserve or enhance the quality of care. [ORGANIZATION] is a mandatory payment model, as we seek to test the effect of payment incentives on availability and choice of treatment modality among a diverse group of providers and suppliers. [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities and [PERSON]93 are selected as [ORGANIZATION] Participants based on their location in [ORGANIZATION]--a set of 30 percent of PERSON8spital [PERSON] HRRs that have been randomly selected to be included in [ORGANIZATION], as well as HRRs with at least 20 percent of component ZIP codes 260 located in [PERSON]5. [PERSON] excludes all [PERSON] Territories from the [ORGANIZATION].--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 260 ZIP codeTM is a trademark of [LOCATION] Postal Service.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] Participants are subject to two payment adjustments. The first is the PERSON8me Dialysis Payment Adjustment [ORGANIZATION], which is an upward adjustment on certain payments made to participating [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities under the [ORGANIZATION] on home dialysis claims, and an upward adjustment to the [ORGANIZATION] paid to participating [PERSON]93 on home dialysis-related claims. The [ORGANIZATION] applies to claims with claim service dates beginning in [PERSON]95anuary 1, [ORGANIZATION]8, and ending on [DATE] [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]19. The second payment adjustment under [ORGANIZATION] is [ORGANIZATION] PP[PERSON] For the PPA, we assess [ORGANIZATION] Participants home dialysis rate and transplant rate during a Measurement Year MY, which includes 12 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 of performance data. Each MY overlaps with the previous MY, if any, and the subsequent MY, if any, for a period of 6 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09. Each MY has a corresponding PPA Period--a [DATE]40 period which begins 6 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 after the conclusion of the M[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] We adjust certain payments for [ORGANIZATION] Participants during the PPA Period based on the [ORGANIZATION] Participants home dialysis rate and transplant rate, calculated as the sum of the transplant waitlist rate and the living donor transplant rate, during the corresponding M[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] Based on an [ORGANIZATION] Participants achievement in relation to benchmarks based on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate observed in [ORGANIZATION] during [DATE]3, and the [ORGANIZATION] Participants improvement in relation to its own home dialysis rate and transplant rate during [DATE]3, we make an upward or downward adjustment to certain payments to the [ORGANIZATION] Participant. The magnitude of the positive and negative PPAs for [ORGANIZATION] Participants increases over the course of [ORGANIZATION]. These PPAs apply to claims with claim service dates beginning [DATE], [DATE]1, and ending [DATE]9.2. Summary of Proposed PERSON4ges to [ORGANIZATION] The proposed rule, titled [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION], Payment for [ORGANIZATION] Furnished to Individuals With Acute [PERSON] End-Stage [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Incentive [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] Model 85 FR 363[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54 through [DATE], referred to herein as the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, was published in [ORGANIZATION] on DATE[DATE]1. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, we proposed a number of policy changes to [ORGANIZATION] beginning for [ORGANIZATION]8 of the Model, which begins [PERSON]95anuary 1, [DATE]1. We proposed changes to the methodology for attributing Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON]93 to better reflect the care relationship between beneficiaries who receive pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] transplants and the [PERSON]93 who provide their care. We proposed to include nocturnal in-center dialysis in the numerator of the home dialysis rate calculation for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities not owned in whole or in part by a large dialysis organization [PERSON]92 as well as [PERSON]93, to incentivize additional alternative renal replacement modalities. In addition, we proposed to exclude beneficiaries who are diagnosed with and receiving treatment with chemotherapy or radiation for vital solid organ cancers from the transplant rate to align with common transplant center requirements. We proposed to modify the PPA achievement benchmarking methodology to increase achievement benchmarks by 10 percent above rates observed in [ORGANIZATION] every two MYs, beginning for [DATE]4[DATE] [DATE]1. We proposed to stratify PPA achievement benchmarks based on the proportion of attributed beneficiaries who are dually-eligible for [PERSON] and ORG13 or receive the [ORGANIZATION]IS during the MY, and to introduce [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] to the PPA improvement scoring methodology, both in an effort to encourage [ORGANIZATION] Participants to address disparities in renal replacement modality choice among beneficiaries with lower socioeconomic status. We proposed to modify the PPA improvement benchmarking and scoring methodology to ensure an [ORGANIZATION] Participant can receive an improvement score even if its home dialysis rate or transplant rate was zero during [DATE]42. We proposed to add processes and requirements for [PERSON] to share certain model data with [ORGANIZATION] Participants. We also proposed an additional programmatic waiver as necessary solely for purposes of allowing [PERSON]93 who are [ORGANIZATION] participants to furnish kidney disease patient education services via telehealth under [ORGANIZATION]. In addition, we proposed to permit [PERSON]93 who are [ORGANIZATION] Participants to reduce or waive beneficiary coinsurance for kidney disease patient education services, subject to certain requirements. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, we stated our expectation that the proposed changes would continue to[PERSON] 61949promote the larger goals of increased renal replacement modality choice and are based on many of the issues we laid out in [ORGANIZATION] final rule as issues for which [PERSON] was considering further rulemaking, including updating benchmarks for [ORGANIZATION] Participants and adjusting model parameters based on our implementation experience [DATE] FR 363[DATE]6.3. Impact of the PERSON4ges on [ORGANIZATION] Evaluation As we described in [ORGANIZATION] final rule, an evaluation of [ORGANIZATION] will be conducted in accordance with section [DATE]b4 of the [ORGANIZATION], which requires the [ORGANIZATION]retary to evaluate each model tested by [PERSON]90. We noted that we believe an independent evaluation of the Model is necessary to understand the impacts of the Model on quality of care and [PERSON] program expenditures 85 FR [ZIP]. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 363[DATE]6, we proposed to update the evaluation plan presented in [ORGANIZATION] final rule to account for all the policies in that proposed rule, if finalized. PERSON8wever, we noted that changes in the construction of the PPA would have no impact on the evaluation approach to analyzing the final PPA values. This is because the evaluation plan already includes a consideration of the final PPA values, rather than an evaluation of each step in the PPA calculation. PERSON8wever, we stated our expectation that we would conduct subgroup analyses in the evaluation to determine the effect of the proposed [ORGANIZATION], if finalized, in reducing health disparities among beneficiaries with lower socioeconomic status. As part of the detailed economic analysis included in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule and in section VIII.[LOCATION]184 of this final rule, the transplant waitlist benchmarks were [ORGANIZATION]1ly inflated by approximately 3-percentage points growth. This was a change from [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR 613[DATE], in which the waitlist benchmarks were [ORGANIZATION]1ly inflated by approximately 2-percentage points growth observed during [DATE]81 [DATE]38 through [DATE] to project rates of growth. By increasing the expected effect to a 3-percentage point change, we improve our ability to detect such an effect at the [PERSON]95 current size. In [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we stated that to detect a 2-percentage point increase in the transplant waitlist rate, we would need 30 percent of the 306 HRRs in order to detect an effect of this size with 80 percent power and an alpha of [ORGANIZATION], we stated that a model of this size would be large enough to detect a one and one-half percentage point change in the home dialysis rate 85 FR [ZIP]. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 363[DATE]6, we clarified that our unadjusted power calculations show that the model requires 30 percent of the 306 HRRs to detect the one and one-half percentage point change in the home dialysis rate with 80 percent power and an alpha of 0.05 Given the updated expectation that the transplant waitlist rate is likely to increase by 3-percentage points as a result of [ORGANIZATION], the power analysis shows the evaluation would also have sufficient sample size to detect, as statistically significant, a 3-percentage point change in the transplant waitlist rate with 80 percent power and an alpha of 0.05 We did not receive any comments regarding our proposal to update the evaluation plan presented in [ORGANIZATION] final rule to account for all the policies in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, if finalized. We are therefore finalizing our proposal and will modify the model evaluation to analyze the impact of the policies finalized in this final rule.B. Summary of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] to Comments, and Finalized Policies for [ORGANIZATION] The [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule was published in [ORGANIZATION] on DATE[DATE]1, with a comment period that ended on DATE[DATE]2. In that proposed rule, we proposed to make a number of changes to [ORGANIZATION], to begin [PERSON]95anuary 1, [DATE]1, as described previously in section I.B.4 of this rule. We received 64 timely public comments on our proposals, including comments from [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities national renal, nephrologist, and patient organizations patients manufacturers health care systems and individual clinicians, including nephrologists, nurses, and social workers. We also received comments related to issues that we did not discuss in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule. These include, for example, comments recommending that [PERSON] incorporate staff-assisted home dialysis into [ORGANIZATION], support the training and education of home dialysis nurses, and including transplant providers as [ORGANIZATION] Participants. These comments expressed concern over implementing home dialysis programs or the negative payment adjustments included in the Model. While we are generally not addressing those comments in this final rule, we thank the commenters for their input and may consider their recommendations in future rulemaking. In this final rule, we provide a summary of each proposed provision, a summary of the public comments received and our responses to them, and the policies we are finalizing for [ORGANIZATION]. These policies take effect [PERSON]95anuary 1, [DATE]1, unless otherwise specified. Comment Many commenters supported the goals of [ORGANIZATION]. Some of these commenters stated that they appreciate the effort to advance home dialysis during the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic since dialyzing at home allows patients to socially distance and avoid going into hospitals or medical centers. [ORGANIZATION] We thank the commenters for the support of the [ORGANIZATION] goals. Comment One commenter suggested that [PERSON] implement [ORGANIZATION] nationwide in order to improve quality of care for all [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] beneficiaries. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]tion [DATE] of the [ORGANIZATION] authorizes the [ORGANIZATION]retary to test payment and service delivery models intended to reduce [PERSON] costs while preserving or improving care quality that, if effective, are considered for expansion to the [PERSON] program. As noted in [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR [ZIP], the randomized selection of 30 percent of HRRs allows [PERSON] sufficient statistical power to assess the effect of [ORGANIZATION]. If the test of [ORGANIZATION] satisfies the criteria for expansion in section [DATE]c of the [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] may consider expanding the duration and scope of [ORGANIZATION], including on a nationwide basis. Comment One commenter suggested that [ORGANIZATION] be an Advanced Alternative Payment Model [ORGANIZATION] allowing [ORGANIZATION] Participants to be eligible as qualifying [ORGANIZATION] participants [PERSON]58P, similar to what is proposed for [ORGANIZATION]. Regarding the commenters reference to the RO Model, we finalized our proposal that the RO Model be designed to qualify as an Advanced [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON][DATE]6 [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR 612[DATE] through [ZIP]. [ORGANIZATION] As noted in [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR [ZIP], modifying [ORGANIZATION] to be an Advanced [ORGANIZATION] would subject [ORGANIZATION] Participants to significant downside risk from the outset, which we believe would put many [ORGANIZATION] Participants in a difficult financial position. As further noted in [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR 612[DATE]4, [PERSON]93 may simultaneously participate in [ORGANIZATION] and the complementary [PERSON]56idney Care Choices Model, a voluntary[PERSON] 61950model we anticipate will meet the criteria to be an Advanced [ORGANIZATION] beginning in [DATE]1. Comment Several commenters urged that patients should have the choice of modality that works best for them, and [ORGANIZATION] should support patient choices. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the commenters feedback to support beneficiary choice of treatment modality. [ORGANIZATION], as described in [ORGANIZATION] final rule, aims to support beneficiaries choosing alternatives to in-center dialysis. Additionally, [ORGANIZATION] Participants are subject to provisions protecting beneficiary freedom of choice set forth at [ORGANIZATION]. 512.120 of our regulations, as discussed in [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 [ORGANIZATION]. Technical Clarifications For [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities that are [ORGANIZATION] Participants, [ORGANIZATION] makes certain upward and downward adjustments to the Adjusted [ORGANIZATION] per Treatment Base Rate for certain dialysis claims via the PERSON8me Dialysis Payment Adjustment [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] PP[PERSON] The term Adjusted [ORGANIZATION] per Treatment Base Rate is defined at 42 [ORGANIZATION] 512.[DATE]0 as the per-treatment payment amount as defined in [ORGANIZATION]. 413.230 of this chapter, including patient-level adjustments and facility-level adjustments, and excluding any applicable training adjustment, add-on payment amount, outlier payment amount, [PERSON][DATE] amount, and [ORGANIZATION] amount. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 363[DATE]6, we clarified the claims that are subject to adjustment under [ORGANIZATION]. Specifically, as [ORGANIZATION]. 413.230 is specific to the calculation of payment amounts under the [ORGANIZATION], we clarify that the [ORGANIZATION] and PPA do not apply to claims from [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities that are not paid under [ORGANIZATION] and are instead paid through other [PERSON] payment systems. We are also updating the name of one of the sources of data used throughout [ORGANIZATION]. In [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we specified that one source of data for [ORGANIZATION] is [PERSON]5, a data management system that [PERSON] uses to collect data from [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities 85 FR 61[DATE][DATE]. As we explained in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 363[DATE]6, since publication of [ORGANIZATION] final rule, [PERSON] has replaced [PERSON]5 with the End Stage [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]58uality Reporting System E[PERSON]58RGPE13 As such, we will refer to [PERSON]5 for data that was generated before the change to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, which [PERSON] began using in [ORGANIZATION], and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 for data that was generated after the change to E[PERSON]58RGPE13 The following is a summary of the comments received on our technical clarifications related to claims subject to adjustment under [ORGANIZATION] and the replacement of [PERSON]5 data with [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 data and our responses. Comment A few commenters stated that they support the technical clarification that the [ORGANIZATION] and PPA do not apply to claims from [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities that are not paid under [ORGANIZATION] and are instead paid through other [PERSON] payment systems. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate commenters support for this technical clarification. Comment A few commenters stated that they support the technical clarification that [ORGANIZATION] will refer to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2 data in [STREET] of [PERSON]5 data. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate commenters support for this technical clarification. Comment A few commenters expressed concerns related to the challenges faced during the transition from [PERSON]5 to [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]2, and resulting concerns over data quality. [ORGANIZATION] As discussed elsewhere in this final rule, we are aware of concerns related to the transition from [PERSON]5 to E[PERSON]58RGPE13 For the purposes of [ORGANIZATION], we will continue to use the best data available and will work with [ORGANIZATION] Participants to address any data issues that arise.2. [ORGANIZATION] PPA [PERSON] for PERSON45ving [ORGANIZATION] In [ORGANIZATION] final rule 85 FR 6129[DATE], we established that beneficiaries are attributed to [PERSON]93 for the purposes of calculating the home dialysis rate and transplant rate. For the home dialysis rate and the transplant waitlist and living donor kidney transplant portions of the transplant rate, as described in 42 [ORGANIZATION] 512.360c2i, an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [PERSON] is generally attributed to [ORGANIZATION] with the earliest [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]01 capitation payment [ORGANIZATION] claim billed during [DATE]43. If more than one [ORGANIZATION] submits a claim for the [ORGANIZATION] furnished to a single [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [PERSON] with the same earliest claim service date at the claim line through date for [DATE]43, the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [PERSON] is randomly attributed to one of these [PERSON]93. PERSON8wever, a beneficiary who receives a pre-emptive living donor transplant Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] is not on dialysis and therefore cannot be attributed to a [ORGANIZATION] using an [ORGANIZATION] claim. As a result, under [ORGANIZATION]. 512.360c2ii, a Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] is generally attributed to [ORGANIZATION] with whom the Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] had the most claims [DATE]44 and [DATE]43 of the transplant. If no [ORGANIZATION] has had the plurality of claims for a given Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] such that multiple [PERSON]93 each had the same number of claims for that beneficiary during the MY, the Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] is attributed to [ORGANIZATION] associated with the latest claim service date during the MY up to and including [DATE]43 of the transplant, as described in [ORGANIZATION]. 512.360c2ii[PERSON] If no [ORGANIZATION] had the plurality of claims for a given Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] such that multiple [PERSON]93 each had the same number of services for that beneficiary during the MY, and more than one of those [PERSON]93 had the latest claim service date during the MY up to and including [DATE]43 of the transplant, the Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] is randomly attributed to one of these [PERSON]93, as described in [ORGANIZATION]. 512.360c2iiB. As stated in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 363[DATE][DATE], upon further review of the beneficiary attribution methodology for living donor kidney transplants, we realized that an unintended consequence of the current attribution methodology is that Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] may be attributed to the nephrologist who manages their transplant, not [ORGANIZATION] who has seen them through the living donor transplant process. As stated in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule, to avoid this effect, [PERSON] believes it is necessary to update the attribution methodology for Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON45ving donor transplants are relatively rare events that require nephrologist support over time in order to inform beneficiaries of their transplant options and to assist them in finding a living donor. PERSON8wever, the current Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] attribution methodology is based on visits from the beginning of a M[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] As a result, if a Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] has a transplant early in a MY, the beneficiary may be attributed to a transplant nephrologist who may have had only a single visit with the beneficiary, rather than [ORGANIZATION] who oversaw the largest share of the care that led to the beneficiary receiving the living donor transplant. As a result, we proposed to update the attribution methodology for Pre-emptive[PERSON] [ZIP][ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON]93, beginning for [DATE]4[DATE], in new provisions at [ORGANIZATION]. 512.360c2iii. Rather than attributing a Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] to [ORGANIZATION] with the plurality of claims from [DATE]46 and [DATE]43 of the transplant, beginning for [DATE]4[DATE], we proposed to attribute Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] with whom the beneficiary has had the most claims during [DATE]0 prior to the transplant date. Further, we proposed that if no [ORGANIZATION] has had the most claims for the Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] such that multiple [PERSON]93 each had the same number of claims for that beneficiary in [DATE]0 preceding the date of the transplant, the Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] would be attributed to [ORGANIZATION] associated with the latest claim service date at the claim line through date during [DATE]0 preceding the date of the transplant. We proposed that if more than one of those [PERSON]93 had the latest claim service date at the claim line through date during [DATE]0 preceding the date of the transplant, the Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] would be randomly attributed to one of these [PERSON]93. We proposed that the Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] would be considered eligible for attribution to a [ORGANIZATION] under this proposed new [ORGANIZATION]. 512.360c2iii if the Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] has at least 1 eligible-month during the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]80 period that includes [DATE]43 of the transplant and the 11 [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 prior to [DATE]. We proposed that [DATE] would refer to [DATE]49 during which the Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] not does not meet exclusion criteria in [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE]. We proposed changes for Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] attribution to [PERSON]93 in order to identify and attribute Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] who assisted the [PERSON] through the living donor transplant process. We sought comment on these proposed changes for Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] attribution to [PERSON]93 beginning for [DATE]4[DATE] in proposed new [ORGANIZATION]. 512.360c2iii. The following is a summary of the comments received on the proposed changes for Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] attribution to [PERSON]93 beginning for [DATE]4[DATE] and our responses. Comment Several commenters supported our proposal to update the attribution methodology for Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON]93 to identify and attribute Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] that assisted the [PERSON] through the living donor transplant process. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the support and feedback. Comment A few commenters expressed that the proposed changes to the attribution methodology for Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] would have a limited impact, due to the small number of Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] We appreciate the feedback from commenters and recognize the small number of Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. We nonetheless believe it is necessary to update this methodology to ensure that those Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] are attributed to [ORGANIZATION] who oversaw the largest share of the care that led to the beneficiary receiving the living donor transplant to more accurately measure [ORGANIZATION] performance. Final Rule [ORGANIZATION]ion After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal in our regulation at [ORGANIZATION]. 512.360c2iii to change Pre-emptive [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] attribution to [PERSON]93 beginning for [DATE]4[DATE], without modification.3. PPA PERSON8me Dialysis Ratea. [LOCATION] on PERSON8me Dialysis Rate Calculation A primary goal of [ORGANIZATION] is to support beneficiary modality choice by encouraging [ORGANIZATION] Participants to support beneficiaries in selecting alternatives to in-center dialysis. Under 42 [ORGANIZATION] 512.365b, [PERSON] includes in-center self-dialysis treatment beneficiary [DATE]81 in the numerator of the home dialysis rate. Specifically, the home dialysis rate for both [PERSON]93 and [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities is calculated as the number of dialysis treatment beneficiary [DATE]81 during the MY in which attributed beneficiaries received dialysis at home, plus one half of the total number of dialysis treatment beneficiary [DATE]81 during the MY in which the attributed beneficiaries received self-dialysis in center. As described in [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we included self-dialysis in the home dialysis rate calculation because we believe in-center self-dialysis may provide a gradual transition from in-center to home dialysis, and provide beneficiaries with the time needed to get comfortable conducting dialysis by themselves, under medical supervision 85 FR [ZIP]. The denominator for the home dialysis rate is the total dialysis treatment beneficiary [DATE]81 for attributed [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] beneficiaries during the MY, as described in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]. 512.365b1i and 512.365b2i. This includes the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]09 during which attributed beneficiaries received maintenance dialysis at home or in an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility.b. Nocturnal Dialysis Nocturnal in-center dialysis is a form of in-center dialysis conducted [TIME] for extended [TIME] while the beneficiary is asleep. This dialysis is longer and slower than traditional in-center dialysis, can take more than 5 [TIME] per treatment, and can be performed 3 to [DATE] [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19s [DATE]. As this type of in-center dialysis is conducted [TIME], it allows the beneficiary more time and flexibility to have a continuous job, as well as a social and family life.261--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 261 [LOCATION]24, [PERSON], [PERSON]6, [PERSON]95anice P.

PMID [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54106828.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- While nocturnal in-center dialysis offers some of the same clinical and quality of life benefits as home dialysis in comparison to traditional in-center dialysis, use of nocturnal in-center dialysis is rare. Based on analyses described in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule and in section VIII.[LOCATION]184.e of this final rule, less than 1 percent of beneficiaries eligible for attribution to [ORGANIZATION] Participants were receiving self-dialysis or nocturnal in-center dialysis in [DATE]. Potential limitations to nocturnal in-center dialysis utilization include supply factors. At present, few [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities offer nocturnal dialysis in [DATE], approximately 1 percent of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities furnished nocturnal in-center dialysis based on our analysis of claims data. [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities may face staffing challenges to initiating a nocturnal dialysis program. Potential limitations to nocturnal in-center dialysis also include demand factors [ORGANIZATION] may be unaware of nocturnal in-center dialysis, or may be averse to sleeping at an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility or experience difficulty sleeping while receiving dialysis.269--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 269 Ibid.---------------------------------------------------------------------------c. [ORGANIZATION] in PERSON8me Dialysis Rate We proposed to modify the home dialysis rate calculation, for [ORGANIZATION] Participants that are either [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities not owned in whole or in part by an [PERSON]92 or [PERSON]93, to include nocturnal in-center dialysis in the numerator beginning for [DATE]4[DATE]. As described in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule and previously in this section of the final rule, we believe this modality allows beneficiaries to continue to receive maintenance dialysis in an [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility under medical supervision, but at a time of [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]19 that is more convenient for them, and in a manner that is associated with improved health outcomes. In particular, in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 363[DATE]8, we stated our belief that including nocturnal in-center dialysis in the home dialysis rate may improve access to alternative renal replacement modalities for beneficiaries who are unable to dialyze at home. In addition to promoting access to the benefits of additional alternative renal replacement modalities for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] [ORGANIZATION] who may not be able to dialyze at home, in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule we stated our belief that including nocturnal in-center dialysis in the calculation of the home dialysis rate offers an additional pathway to success for [ORGANIZATION] Participants with more limited resources. As described in [ORGANIZATION] final rule, we received comments that some [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities, particularly independent [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities owned by small dialysis organizations, may be unable to develop and maintain a home dialysis program 85 FR 613[[ORGANIZATION]OCATION]54 through [DATE]. Operating a home dialysis program requires specialized staff, as well as upfront investment in additional equipment and certification. Establishing a nocturnal in-center dialysis program does not require additional equipment or certification, and may be more feasible for independent [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities owned by small dialysis organizations, and by extension, the [PERSON]93 who serve their patients. In the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule [DATE] FR 363[DATE]8, we considered including nocturnal in-center dialysis in the numerator of the home dialysis rate for [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities owned in whole or in part by [PERSON]92s as well. PERSON8wever, we noted in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] proposed rule that we do not believe that [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities owned in whole or in part by [PERSON]92s face the same resource constraints in establishing a home dialysis program as independent [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities or [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities owned by small dialysis organizations. [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities owned in whole or in part by [PERSON]92s may be more likely to have access to a home dialysis program, either in the [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facility itself or within the network of facilities owned by the same parent company in that facilitys aggregation group. [[ORGANIZATION]OCATION] facilities owned in whole or in part by [PERSON]92s may also have greater access to the upfront capital necessary to establish a home dialysis program if they do not already have, or have access to, a home dialysis program."

Briefly, after DATE0 of [PERSON] treatment, 300 subjects men and women, aged [ORGANIZATION] received integrated comprehensive dental treatment. Their treatment outcomes were compared with those of sex matched patients who were likewise treated for [PERSON] but did not receive comprehensive oral health care. Results revealed that patients that received dental care had substantially elevated improvements including 1 an increase in rates of [PERSON] treatment completion 2 an increase in drug abstinence 3 an increase in employment and 4 a reduction in homelessness. The purpose of the present study was to extend these findings by investigating if comprehensive dental care improves quality of life in individuals receiving [ORGANIZATION], which includes adult [PERSON] patients receiving dental care, in a manner that correlates with the improved [PERSON] treatment outcomes."

From DATE5. evidence of role failure in participants as documented by them endorsing forging checks, failed financial responsibilities, homelessness, failed family responsibilities, as well as arrests, convicted felonies and time spent in jail. The clinical course of the 21 antisocial behaviors, with ages of onset, was determined comparing the mean age of each symptom using [ORGANIZATION] rho and comparing the results based on race, diagnostic label, and sex. The clinical course was found to be highly significantly similar between the three races, the two sexes and the two diagnostic labels rho  0.925-0.978, p lt 0.001. However individual symptom counts were significantly different across the groups when they were compared using logistic regression, covaried for significant demographic variables. Women reported fewer symptoms, were less likely to report fights, school expulsions, arrests or jail time, but more likely than males to run away from home. Those with [ORGANIZATION] had more symptoms overall than those with AABS including being less likely to experience remorse. African Americans, American Indians and those with [ORGANIZATION] were more likely to be expelled from school and arrested."

scranton,2021-04-14T00:00:00Z,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,The Scranton Times,homelessness,Students flocked to cyber-charter schools [ORGANIZATION]. So did district revenue and federal relief funds,"[ORGANIZATION], at the time the [ORGANIZATION] Secretary of [ORGANIZATION], told the press that the federal government would require schools to open for instruction in [ORGANIZATION]. Her remarks came soon after the [PERSON] administration issued its first universal mask mandate, which raised the possibility that students and staff in school buildings would have to be masked DATE1. [ORGANIZATION] had thousands of enrollment inquiries from potential students when its staff returned from their DATE2 break, according to [ORGANIZATION], the schools chief executive officer. [ORGANIZATION] said the school redeployed 40 staff members to help the enrollment office keep up with the overwhelming deluge of emails and phone calls. By the time [ORGANIZATION] began in [DATE], it had hit its enrollment limit of nearly 12,000 students. When the pandemic shuttered [PERSON]s classrooms [PERSON], the states 14 cyber charter schools said they were uniquely qualified to help students thrive in their new world of online learning. Students and their families evidently agreed Enrollment in [PERSON]s cyber charter schools shot up by 60 percent during the pandemic, from 38,000 students [ORGANIZATION] to 60,000 students [ORGANIZATION], data from ORG1 show. The rush of students to cyber charter schools has also brought an influx of cash - along with renewed calls from traditional [INSTITUTION] advocates for the state to more closely scrutinize the cost of cyber charters, which perennially log some of the lowest academic performance in the state. Like brick and mortar charter schools, cyber charters are funded by contributions from [INSTITUTION] districts. Districts pay the online schools an DATE8 rate for each of their students who opt to enroll in one. District payments to charter schools have been rising steadily for DATE9. But theyre expected to double DATE10, driven largely by a 350 million increase in contributions to cyber charter schools, according to ORG2. Cyber charter schools are also due to be some of the leading recipients of federal funds that were intended to ease the transition to remote learning and mitigate learning loss among students.Thats despite the fact that cyber charter schools appealed to families by pledging dependability during the pandemic, saying they could spare children the disruptions that have plagued public schools for the [PERSON]. I dont want to go over the top, but its perplexing at best and appalling at worst, [ORGANIZATION] said of the federal revenues slated to accrue to cyber charter schools DATE10. They dont have the same costs as brick and mortar schools. Everyone is affected by [PERSON], but Im sure they are the least affected of anyone in the [INSTITUTION] system, [ORGANIZATION] told [PERSON]. Estimates from the [PERSON] administration show that 12 of the states cyber charter schools are due to receive a cumulative 151.9 million in cash subsidies from [ORGANIZATION] - the 1.9 trillion federal stimulus package that [ORGANIZATION] approved in [PERSON], which sent 5 billion in one-time emergency relief aid to [PERSON]s [INSTITUTION] districts. Those one-time payments are the third installment that [PERSON] schools are due to receive from the federal [ORGANIZATION] fund. They come on top of 49 million in ESSER funds that cyber charters got from the federal stimulus package that passed in DATE13. Cyber charter schools also received 10 million under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security CARES Act that passed DATE14. All told, the one-time cash infusions to cyber charters are due to exceed 211 million, not including [ORGANIZATION] Loans that some of them claimed [PERSON]. When cyber charter schools were included in the first first round of emergency aid [PERSON], [INSTITUTION] advocates questioned whether they should get a share. As the GPE2-based news outlet ORG6 reported in DATE16, those funds were intended to help schools pivot to remote learning - something that cyber charter schools were already equipped to provide. The two subsequent allocations from the federal government grew in size and came with different rules. The 2.2 billion in emergency aid that [PERSON] schools shared in DATE13 was supposed to support food programs and technology. Schools are still waiting on federal guidance for the more recent round of funding, but the state has told them to use at least some of it to address learning loss and support vulnerable populations - a segment that includes children with disabilities, English learners, and students experiencing homelessness. [INSTITUTION] advocates are still skeptical that cyber charter schools are needful recipients of the federal cash. Weve been hearing since [DATE] that traditional schools closed that cyber charters were built for the pandemic, PERSON5, executive director of ORG7, which advocates for tighter regulation of all charter schools, said. If they were perfectly positioned and students werent losing learning, those things dont match up. [PERSON] doesnt take issue with the [STREET] the state has decided to distribute its federal dollars the formula they used relies on a schools Title-1 allocation, which weights federal funds towards schools that educate low-income students. But the state system has created an issue where charters have a lot of excess funding right now and school districts dont, [PERSON] said. Traditional public schools and even brick-and-mortar charter schools have had to retrofit facilities to accommodate in-person learning DATE10. Many have had to alter transportation schedules, too, so they could enforce social distancing on school buses or accommodate hybrid school schedules. A DATE17 survey from [ORGANIZATION] found that most school districts have seen their costs skyrocket while state aid flatlines and local revenue sources slowed or declined. The emergency funds from the federal government may allow many to avoid tax hikes - at least in the short term. A [ORGANIZATION] spokeswoman said its up to schools to apply for the federal aid, and that its unclear what would happen if a recipient wants to relinquish their share. Schools that receive ESSER funds have to report how they spend it and undergo an audit from the [ORGANIZATION] if they get more than 750,000. Cyber charter schools say that their expenses have also increased as a result of the pandemic. [ORGANIZATION] says [ORGANIZATION] has made technology upgrades and hired more teachers and support staff. The school will likely cover the new personnel costs with revenue from [INSTITUTION] districts, since federal relief funds are meant to be used for one-time expenses and programs. [ORGANIZATION] said [ORGANIZATION] intends to use all of its stimulus money in strict compliance with federal guidelines. And he expects there will be no shortage of initiatives that fall within its purview. [ORGANIZATION] has a sizable population of students who dont have stable housing, [ORGANIZATION] said, and administrators are preparing for their ranks to grow if federal eviction protections expire DATE10. The school has provided those students with cell phones and other equipment to ensure they have stable access to their learning materials. [ORGANIZATION] said educators are also preparing DATE18 curriculum, which aims to prevent learning loss - a need he said could be particularly acute following DATE19 that brought unemployment, illness and death to students homes. Weve been consistent with our reaching, that doesnt mean students home lives have been consistent, [ORGANIZATION] said. Were here teaching, but that doesnt mean learning is as good as we would like it to be. [ORGANIZATION], which is slated to receive 24 million under the most recent stimulus package, also said it would spend the cash according to federal law, though a spokesperson didnt respond to follow-up questions about specific expenditures. [PERSON] did not respond to a request for comment. [ORGANIZATION] still admits that cyber charter schools have been blessed with good fortune DATE10. His school was already projecting a surplus when it set its budget DATE20. He says its typical for his school to end DATE21 with a cushion, but expects that DATE10s surplus will be bigger than in the past. Can I say that every dollar weve received in additional revenue has been needed for expenses? [ORGANIZATION] said. No, it has not.A silver lining?Cyber school proponents and their critics agree on at least two things right now that the pandemic is going to entrench remote learning in [PERSON], and that it will soon become much easier to assess the true cost of virtual education. Some students who sought refuge in cyber charters schools DATE10 may return to their public schools if they reopen DATE23. Whether that will translate into big enrollment fluctuations DATE24 is the biggest crystal ball question that cyber schools are dealing with right now, [ORGANIZATION] said. But [INSTITUTION] advocates such as [PERSON] think that pupils across the state will expect some degree of remote education, even if they stay enrolled in a district school. Hundreds of [PERSON] school districts were offering remote learning options before the pandemic shuttered schools [PERSON]. Many more spun up online academies at DATE25, hoping they could [PERSON] with cyber charters and keep students - and their attendant tuition dollars - in their district. [INSTITUTION] officials have long said that they can offer online instruction more cheaply than their cyber charter competitors. A DATE26 [PERSON] by the [PERSON] Association of School Administrators found that district-run cyber schools could educate students for an average of 5,000 per [DATE] what it costs for them to send a child to a cyber charter school. That study didnt evaluate their academic outcomes for students. Charter critics such as [ORGANIZATION] argue that cyber charter schools inflate the cost of educating children online. A paper that [ORGANIZATION] published in DATE27 contends that [PERSON]s current method for funding cyber charter schools provides them with more cash than they need to educate students. She further argues that weaknesses in the states charter school law allows them to spend excess funds on advertising and expensive management firms. [ORGANIZATION]s research relies on cyber charter schools federal tax filings and DATE28 budget reports. Reporters have also used public records [ORGANIZATION] to piece together their spending on advertising and gifts for families. But [ORGANIZATION] said that a dearth of publicly available information makes it difficult to get a clear picture of their finances. Shed like to see the state conduct more regular, rigorous audits of cyber charter schools. A review by ORG14 in DATE13 found that six of the states 14 cyber charter schools have never been reviewed by state auditors. A [ORGANIZATION] spokeswoman also confirmed DATE29 that eleven cyber charter schools are technically operating under expired charters. Cyber charters expire after five DATE22, at which point schools must apply to the state for renewal - a process that includes a comprehensive review of their student achievement and financial operations. State law allows charters to remain in effect pending their renewal. But charter operators have complained for DATE22 that their applications languish while awaiting review from state regulators. With a historic number of students now learning in online environments, [ORGANIZATION] thinks its time for the state to redouble its efforts to regulate cyber charter schools. That should start, she said, by figuring out how much it really costs to educate a student online in [PERSON]. Whether lawmakers want to convene a special commission to study the issue or tap an outside researcher, we really need to figure out what the cost actually is, [ORGANIZATION] said. Maybe the only silver lining to this huge [PERSON] cloud is we might have more information about what it costs to provide a virtual education, she added. [ORGANIZATION] thinks that the findings may not come out in school districts favor. Cyber charter operators say that their methods are time-tested Schools such as [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have been in business for [ORGANIZATION]1, with no shortage of demand for their enrollment slots. They also say parents should take criticism about their academic performance with a grain of salt. Cyber charter schools perennially log lower student test scores and graduation rates than typical public schools. And a [ORGANIZATION]2 study by ORG16 found that students in cyber charter schools learn less on average than their demographically identical peers in brick-and-mortar charter schools and district schools. Cyber executives such as [ORGANIZATION] attribute that to a highly transient student body. Cyber charters accept students at all points of [DATE], from anywhere in the state, he said. They see high levels of churn as students opt out of traditional public schools. [ORGANIZATION] said that traditional public schools have dismissed cyber education as cheap and easy. But as soon as they had to offer comprehensive online learning themselves, we hear all of a sudden that its expensive and hard, [ORGANIZATION] said. Hopefully there is a better understanding now that we do know and we are good at what were doing.  1  2  3  4 38EXTpdfamp38INDEXTRUE  5  6"
