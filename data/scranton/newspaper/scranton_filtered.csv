scranton,Preserving Philly's charm by converting old buildings into housing units,2022-04-28T00:00:00Z,Axios,WILK,"Why it matters Philadelphia has long struggled to address deteriorating and abandoned properties, which can harm neighborhoods and residents quality of life. Repurposing old buildings into housing is one way to tackle blight, while having less of an environmental impact compared to new construction. The big picture The number of old buildings being converted into apartments is on the rise across the country. Converted units have nearly quadrupled since 2010, from 5,271 to 20,122 by the end of 2021. Philadelphia converted a total of 1,863 units in 2020 and 2021 combined, the most of any U.S. city over that two-year period, according to a report from Rent Cafe1. Between the lines The main hurdle for developers is the cost, David Wilk, a Temple University professor who oversees the real estate program, tells Axios. Its often cheaper to demolish and create new construction rather than converting, Wilk says.The overwhelming majority of redevelopment in the city is still new construction, according to Drexel University economist Kevin Gillen. Yes, but Philadelphia provides some incentives to off-set that. A bill that took effect this year is starting to phase out the citys 10-year property tax abatement2 for new residential construction. But, theres a caveat for converted properties, which get to keep the entire 10-year tax incentive. As of 2019, Rehab projects that are historically designated dont have to provide parking, and some get zoning perks. What theyre saying Ken Weinstein, president of Philly Office Retail, has been repurposing buildings for the past 25 years. Weinstein tells Axios theres a lot of work to be done in the city. If your passion is blight removal, we have a lot of factories and a lot of unused office buildings. We have a lot of blight in the neighborhoods. Paul Steinke, executive director of the Preservation Alliance of Greater Philadelphia, said adaptive reuse projects can help attract tourists to Philly. He hopes it can also make headway in addressing the citys housing crisis. Itd be great to see more adaptive reuse for affordable housing since theres quite a bit for market-rate housing, Steinke says. Itd be nice to see them play a bigger role. Of note Project HOME opened residential housing units3 for those struggling with addiction and on the brink of homelessness in a former elementary school in October.  1  2  3","homelessness, housing crisis, affordable housing"

scranton,Newsom to prioritize climate spending in Calif. budget,2022-01-10T00:00:00Z,ClimateWire,WILK,"She didnt reveal the other four focus areas. Bold climate action has been a priority of the governor for the last three years, and he has no plans of lightening that up, the spokesperson said. The Golden States Legislative Analysts Office projects the budget for fiscal 2022-23 will include a 31.2 billion surplus, the result of the states highest earners flourishing. It follows a similar situation last year, when the state had a surprise 75.7 billion budget surplus for fiscal 2021-22. As part of that, Newsom and the Democratic-controlled Legislature pledged 15 billion dollars over three years to fight climate change and its impacts. It includes efforts to boost zero-emission vehicles and charging stations, and to combat extreme heat, drought and catastrophic wildfires. Senate Leader Toni Atkins D said that push will continue. As we focus on putting Californias wealth to work this year, we have again identified climate as a key budget priority as we begin to negotiate the 2022-23 state budget, Atkins said in a statement. Fires, drought, extreme heat, and the impacts of sea level rise are not going away, and it is the lower-income and middle class Californians who will bear the brunt of climate change. She added that several senators, including policy and budget chairs are focused on these and other policy issues in the climate space. Democratic Assemblymember Phil Ting, chair of the Budget Committee, released a slate of priorities. Those include 10 billion in infrastructure for transportation projects, including transit. But hes also focused on goals that include school funding to deal with learning gaps and mental health issues with the pandemic, and money to reduce homelessness and provide affordable housing. Ting said one of his priorities is ensuring the 15 billion pledged for climate last year gets rolled out as promised. Although it was part of last years package, the money needs to get allocated each year. GOP cites wildfires, drought as issues Republicans argue more money is needed for programs to battle the states frequent droughts. California has been delinquent in building sufficient water storage, a fact that was clearly seen recently as agricultural water supplies dried up, state Sen. Scott Wilk, the Republican leader, said in a letter to Democratic leadership. The state should use surplus funds to build the Sites Reservoir and provide water conveyance in critical areas of the state. This will provide water storage for 1.5 million homes per year and promote much-needed water access for Californias food producers. Ting said he wants to ensure that drought response and water resilience funding goes to the most vulnerable communities while promoting the long-term drought resilience. GOP members also urged more work to prevent wildfires. Scientists say climate change has made those more fierce. Avoiding major wildfires would do more to improve greenhouse gas emissions than many of the majority partys mandates and restrictions, Wilk said. Fire prevention efforts can include improving vegetation management and making at-risk homes more resistant to flames. Environmental groups are lobbying for their priorities. Sierra ClubCalifornia wants more money for water recycling, conservation and efficiency technology. More money to get underserved communities in electric vehicles more money in building decarbonization and getting natural gas and other fossil fuels out of California homes, said Brandon Dawson, the groups director. The group also wants funding toward Newsoms pledge to preserve 30 percent of state land by 2030. Bill Magavern, policy director at Coalition for Clean Air, said the budget should include money to fund programs to convert heavy-duty vehicle and off-road engines to clean models, fulfilling regulations coming from the California Air Resources Board. As well, the state needs to keep funding programs to get people with lower incomes into electric vehicles, such as the Clean Cars 4 All, effort. The California Energy Commissions Clean Transportation Program to fund zero-emission infrastructure also needs support, he said. Transportation is the largest source of the emissions that cause climate change and air pollution, so were largely focused on cleaning up that sector, he said in an email..","homelessness, affordable housing"
scranton,Newsom gives sneak peek of new COVID plan,2022-02-10T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,"The governors remarks  which came during a press conference at which he signed into law a restoration of extra paid time off for COVID-related sick leave3 and assorted tax credits for businesses4  offered the clearest glimpse yet into the states forthcoming plan for treating COVID like any other virus5. Although details remain murky, here are three key takeaways I gleaned from Newsoms comments New plans would likely allow for some level of local control. As we move forward with yet another phase of this pandemic, we do so mindful that each county local health officer, based on local conditions, will make determinations for themselves, Newsom said. Case in point While eight of nine Bay Area counties6 will follow the state and let their indoor mask mandates expire7 after Feb. 15, Santa Clara County8 is joining Los Angeles County9 in holding off until specific conditions are met. Educators are concerned about the consequences of low youth vaccination rates if school mask mandates are lifted. Thats why we continue to work with those local health officers and local superintendents school boards and leaders within the system and try to address their concerns as it relates to community spread, as it relates to what they anticipate experiencing once those mask requirements are removed, Newsom said. Although conditions will continue to change, the state is prepared to take a definitive step in its approach to the virus. We also are in a date with destiny, we recognize that we want to turn the page on the status quo, Newsom said. But even if the state were to lift its school mask mandate, the even more explosive issue of school vaccine mandates10 remains  and some district deadlines are rapidly approaching. Louis Freedberg, a veteran education journalist and past executive director of EdSource, recently opined11 that it would be an educational and political impossibility to keep the states sizable number of unvaccinated kids out of school and in remote learning. But Los Angeles Unified, anticipating that thousands of students wont meet its vaccination deadline, voted Tuesday to move ahead with plans12 to establish six new online schools that could enroll up to 15,000 students. And if districts refuse to enforce the states inoculation mandate, they could lose significant amounts of state funding and liability insurance coverage13.

Big bets on sports gambling Image via iStock Im not a betting person, but Im willing to wager that the battle over sports gambling headed for Californias November 2022 ballot will be an expensive one. On Wednesday, three California tribal governments  the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, the Rincon Band of Luisueño Indians and Wilton Rancheria  announced theyre launching a campaign25 with an initial budget of 100 million to defeat a proposed measure26 that would legalize online sports betting and direct most of the tax revenue to addressing homelessness and mental health. That matches the initial 100 million27 raised by online betting giants such as DraftKings and FanDuel in support of the measure. Californias November 2022 ballot could contain as many as four competing measures over sports gambling28, including one backed by a group of tribes that would authorize in-person sports betting at Indian casinos, for which they make their case in a recent CalMatters commentary29.

scranton,California redistricting stumbles toward finish line,2021-12-20T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,"Messy process  messy maps? From CalMatters reporter Sameea Kamal Its crunch time for Californias independent redistricting commission, and it looks like theyre nearing the finish line, though not without continued criticism. The 14 commissioners are under intense scrutiny2  and face a Dec. 27 deadline to submit their final report to the secretary of state, including new district lines for the U.S. House, state Assembly, state Senate and Board of Equalization. Theyre pledging to vote on adopting the maps today. At the same time, however, theyre hearing from outside critics because theyre drawing some weirdly shaped districts in trying to keep communities of interest together and protect minority voting power. After a barrage of calls last week about the city of San Jose being split into four congressional districts3, the commission redrew the congressional map into what some experts called the ribbon of shame4 - a coastal district starting just south of San Francisco, and moving inland towards Kern County just north of Bakersfield. Even former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder weighed in5, calling it absurd and unnecessary. Holder The CA Commission to now has been a model for the country. I hope they find a way to draw lines that respect communities of interest and avoid a district like this that will only be parodied for the decade. But by Sunday night, after several commissioners voiced buyers remorse on that district, they opted to walk it back for now. That prompted a quick response from San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, who complained that his city6 would become the only major U.S. city without its residents making up a majority of constituents for at least one member of Congress. Liccardo Please stand up for SJ. The commission can revise problems with other districts without depriving SJ of voice in DC. The tug-of-war in response to public comment - solving one problem while trying not to create another - is part of the process, but also emblematic of the commissions struggles since adopting preliminary maps on Nov. 107 and toiling on last-minute adjustments in marathon sessions Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Some of the money will make permanent a California Highway Patrol smash and grab enforcement unit12, which claims 300 arrests and 19 million in recovered merchandise already, and expand it from L.A., San Diego and San Francisco to the Central Valley and Sacramento. As CalMatters Ben Christopher explains13, the takeaway from Newsoms Friday press event seemed to be While crime isnt really high historically and the smash-and-grabs at high-end boutiques are being overblown14, the public is very concerned and the state has a huge budget surplus, so why not spend some more on anti-crime efforts? Newsom Stats mean nothing in terms of your feelings. Its the most recent and clearest example of California Democrats talking tougher on crime15 heading into the 2022 election. Republicans in the Legislature are not impressed. Senate GOP leader Scott Wilk It shouldnt have taken increasing homicide rates, widespread news reports of smash-and-grabs, and pleas from Californians for Democrats to come to this realization. 2. Will stricter EDD rules backfire? The office of the California Employment Development Department in Sacramento on Dec. 18, 2020. AP PhotoRich Pedroncelli The rampant fraud at Californias unemployment department has been a big story during the pandemic. For good reason At least 20 billion in bogus claims16, some filed from behind bars. But what if tightening the rules to stop fraud hurts Californians who can least afford it? Jesse Bedayn of the CalMatters California Divide team explores that conundrum, in the context of a new policy17 that could require tens of thousands of Californians to return their unemployment benefits because they may not have been working or looking for work. The state Economic Development Department began issuing notifications of the proof-of-work requirement last month to about 900,000 people, one third of the recipients of a federal program that ran from March 2020 and ended in September 2021. It was aimed at those who dont usually qualify for unemployment benefits because they are freelancers or small-business owners. Under the policy, they must prove that they were working, or planning to work, prior to filing their unemployment claim. If they cant, they would be ineligible and asked to give the benefits back. That would be more than 32,000 if a recipient received full benefits for the entire 18 months of the program. In addition, if a claimant offered false information, the state could impose a 30 penalty. But some experts say that could force people to pay back money they dont have, and are suggesting giving recipients a pass. Chris Hoene, executive director of the California Budget amp Policy Center We should be saying, Look, if you got unemployment insurance benefits during that time, youre fine. If the concern is fraudulent claims, then do the work to fix the administration of the system. 3. A clarification on nursing homes An item in the Dec. 16 newsletter18 about a California Healthline story on nursing homes19 should have made clear that the industry association opposes tying funding only to staffing, but supports tying funding to other patient quality standards. Also, the item should have said that Assembly Health chairperson Jim Wood is the one appalled by the number of COVID-19 deaths in skilled nursing facilities. New CA housing law Manuela Tobias gives a quick rundown20 of a major change in single-family zoning in a New law in a minute video produced by Byrhonda Lyons. 2021 housing stories you should know William Brown right, and Josh Lowe left with his dog near the encampment where they both were staying before it got disbanded by CalTrans in San Clemente. Nov. 6, 2021. Photo by Ariana Drehsler for CalMatters A lot happened this year on the housing and homelessness beat. Heres a look back at the biggest developments, as reported by CalMatters Manuela Tobias. Did the COVID-19 pandemic and the first population decline since 1850 stop Californias housing prices from rising in 2021? Nope. The statewide median home price reached a record 800,00021, more than double the national average. While potential homeowners had it rough, so did some renters. The Legislature twice extended a statewide eviction moratorium22 that banned landlords from kicking out tenants over missed rent payments. But an investigation by CalMatters uncovered that at least 10,000 households23 fell through that safety net and were locked out between March 2020 and March 2021. The state received more than 5 billion in federal aid for rent relief, but the rollout for tenants and landlords was slowed for much of the year24 by problems with language, reliable internet and public awareness25. There was some action at the state Capitol to increase the housing supply. The most significant move a new law that does away with the single-family zoning26 that dominates the majority of the states developable land. David Garcia, policy director for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley27 It signals that lawmakers are willing to take on the traditional sacred cows of housing and single-family zoning. From a political standpoint, thats a pretty significant shift in the housing landscape. Meanwhile, homelessness became an even bigger issue28 in 2021. In the campaign for the Sept. 14 recall election, the major Republican candidates hammered Gov. Gavin Newsoms policies as ineffective29. The unsheltered population has increased by 24 from 2018 30to about 161,000 people in 2020. Experts believe that number has risen during the pandemic, though the state converted motels to create about 6,000 housing units31. A study by UCLA researchers found that nearly 1,500 people, the vast majority likely homeless, died32 on the streets of Los Angeles County between March 2020 and July 2021, many from drug overdoses. The increase is especially discouraging after the state has spent 13 billion on homelessness since 2018. A scathing state audit from February points to a main culprit a lack of coordination and accountability33 across the web of state agencies and local counties, cities and service providers. Still, Newsom and legislators allotted another 12 billion to address homelessness34 over the next three years, including 2.75 billion to buy and convert hotels35, office and commercial buildings into housing and 2.2 billion for behavioral health treatment. Some money is also going to clear homeless encampments36. Learn even more in the newly updated CalMatters explainer on homelessness37.

scranton,State renews $1.7B contract with troubled COVID lab,2021-11-01T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,"The automatic renewal, which California Health and Human Services Agency spokesperson Sami Gallegos confirmed to me Sunday night, comes as the state faces scrutiny for its failure to release a report investigating significant deficiencies at the lab. Gov. Gavin Newsoms administration said3 the full report would be made available in mid-March. More than seven months later, it is nowhere to be found. I urge you to halt auto-renewal of the contract, Senate Republican Leader Scott Wilk wrote in a late October letter4 to the states top health officials, arguing that it would be irresponsible to let any contract auto-renew when serious allegations remain unanswered and the report out of public reach. Gallegos told me in a statement The state plans to continue to have the Valencia Branch Laboratory operational to ensure that we have adequate testing capabilities going into the winter months. We will continue to evaluate our need for the laboratory as we do with all aspects of our response.The state can elect to terminate the agreement without case sic with 45 days notice. To date, the state has paid PerkinElmer 716 million to operate the laboratory, with majority of funds recovered through the federal funds and health insurance claims. The state opened the Valencia Branch Lab5 in October 2020, two months after giving diagnostics company PerkinElmer a no-bid contract6 to operate it. Problems began popping up almost immediately. Whistleblowers told CBS Sacramento7 that lab techs were sleeping while processing COVID samples, test swabs were found in bathrooms and staff were inadequately trained. Although the state initially disputed the extent of the problems, it later admitted8 that it had become aware of significant deficiencies in December. Indeed, state health inspectors gave the lab an immediate jeopardy designation9  which represents10 the most severe and egregious threat to the health and safety of recipients. Meanwhile, the lab has consistently struggled to meet its mandate11 of processing 150,000 tests a day and turning results around quickly. According to the most recent state data12, the Valencia Branch Lab processed less than 195,000 tests for the week ending Oct. 23 and returned only 40 of test results within 24 hours  one of the lowest rates in the state. The lab also has a history of high rates of invalid, lost or cancelled test results. According to CBS Sacramento13, 1 out of every 42 tests processed at Valencia as of August did not return a clear positive or negative result. PerkinElmer did not respond last week to questions from ABC 7 News14 about the contract renewal. Gallegos said that more than 1,600 schools are using the lab for COVID-19 testing  but that doesnt include the states largest district, Los Angeles Unified. Former Superintendent Austin Beutner told CalMatters Sunday that LAUSD signed a testing contract with private company Summerbio in June 2020  a few months before the state made public its contract with PerkinElmer. Beutner said that each test costs the district about 12 compared to the 53 charged by PerkinElmer15 during the first two weeks of October and that the deal stipulated the district wouldnt pay anything if accuracy thresholds and 24-hour results werent met. State data shows16 Summerbio returns 99 of test results within 24 hours. Beutner LA Unified reviewed the PerkinElmer price and terms and elected to stay with Summerbio because the price and terms were materially better for the school district. Interestingly, the states contract with PerkinElmer17 also allows it to cancel the deal if COVID-19 testing has become commercially available at lower cost and PerkinElmer is unable to achieve comparable cost reduction.

Eleni Kounalakis will lead the California delegation at the United Nations Climate Change Conference22 that begins today in Glasgow, Scotland  the result of Newsom abruptly cancelling his trip23 Friday and announcing that he and First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom would attend virtually due to family obligations. The about-face came a few hours after I reported that details of Newsoms itinerary were practically nonexistent and that virtually no one from the California press corps would be covering Newsom24 at the conference due to his office not telling journalists about the trip until nine days after the deadline to apply for a press credential. Indeed, Newsom had privately questioned his purpose in attending the conference and didnt have plans to make any major announcements, CalMatters Rachel Becker reports25. The last-minute pivot is eerily similar to an episode from August 2020, in which Newsom backed out of a prime-time speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention26 hours before his scheduled speech. Then, to cap off the whirlwind series of events, Newsom announced he would be giving virtual remarks after all  just moments before he appeared via a cell phone livestream. 2. California confronts crime uptick Image via iStock Three indications that crime will likely be a top issue for many California voters in the 2022 elections Los Angeles 2021 homicide rate is already 17 higher than it was in 202027  when the city saw a decade high of 355 killings  and a whopping 49 higher than it was in 2019. As of Oct. 18, the city had logged 320 homicides  putting it on track to potentially top 400 killings28 for the first time since 2006. The surge in murders has increased homicide detectives workload29, resulting in less cases being solved. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva is warning30 that the countys vaccine mandate will result in a mass exodus of law enforcement officers, increasing dangers to public safety.A Safeway grocery store in San Francisco is limiting its hours31 due to what one supervisor described as out of control shoplifting. The move comes a few weeks after Walgreens announced plans to close five San Francisco stores32 because of organized retail crime. Although police data casts doubt on that claim33, the closures have fueled the perception that San Francisco is overrun by crime  and the city itself is hoping that its requirement for municipal employees to return to the office starting today34 will help make downtown seem busier and safer. Californias beleaguered bullet train project has cut through disadvantaged San Joaquin Valley communities, displacing homes, businesses and residents and fueling drug deals and crimes in certain areas, the Los Angeles Times reports35. For example, after the high-speed rail authority paid the city of Wasco to relocate a farmworkers housing site, the vacant units turned into a crime scene. Many of the units have been set on fire. There are homeless folks there, others hiding out, doing drug deals and storing stolen goods, said city manager Scott Hurlbert. 3.

Some of CSUs methods  like personally encouraging students with good grades to re-enroll in classes and launching a digital planner to help visualize degree paths  have been met with praise, while others  such as redesigning core classes where a higher percentage of low-income students and students of color receive Ds and Fs  are more controversial, CalMatters Mikhail Zinshteyn reports37. In other higher-education news, USC is in the midst of yet another scandal. On Friday, USC President Carol Folt acknowledged the university waited too long38 to notify students about numerous allegations of drugging and sexual assault at Sigma Nu fraternity parties. USC authorities on Sept. 3039 were informed of five to seven of these incidents, but didnt notify the community until Oct. 2040  four days after yet another student reported a sexual assault at Sigma Nu. The university has since suspended Sigma Nu and is enforcing a moratorium on all fraternity parties.

Applicants must detail prior earnings and, when certifying for benefits every two weeks, report any current earnings. The state looks at both when it decides how much to pay in benefits.In California, normal unemployment payments range from 40-450 a week. An online EDD calculator estimates5 how much those payments will total.Regular benefits tend to replace around 45 of prior weekly earnings. That can leave families stretched thin by unemployment, particularly in Californias high-cost cities. For 16 weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, the federal government bumped benefits up by 6006, a sizable addition.

Unemployment Insurance eligibility has been expanded, and may include those who have to miss work to care for children. While benefits are typically capped at 26 weeks in a year, two new extensions8 allow for 13 and then 20 additional weeks.Pandemic Unemployment Assistance is a new federal program that provides unemployment benefits9 ranging from 167-450 to those ineligible for typical unemployment insurance, like freelancers, independent contractors, gig workers and people with limited work histories. COVID-19-related job impacts qualify workers for this program.The extra 600 a week, also made available under the federal CARES Act, was automatically added to each week of benefits between March 29 and July 25. Now its up to politicians in D.C. and Sacramento to decide if it will be extended. The reason for the drastic measures is clear. Millions of Californians have been hit hard10 by the pandemic, particularly workers who are young, female or non-white. One survey showed11 a third of state residents dont know how theyll pay next months rent. Another researcher estimated12 that the rate of household food insecurity has doubled.

As out-of-work Californians slogged through13 150 redials to the unemployment office or long14 waits for checks docked for previously unknown penalties, the Mercury News reported15 that just 3.1 million of the more than 5 million California workers who applied for benefits from March-May had received their first checks by early July. All over the state, public officials demanded answers16 and an audit17 of the EDD after delays that in some cases stretched for months. Reports of technical glitches and unexplained delays still abound in newly formed Facebook support groups and news articles, but officials say18 that common reasons for hold-ups include identity verification, missing information on wages and application errors like incomplete work histories. Theres also no denying how drastically the workload has increased. The state processed eight times as many applications during the worst week so far of the coronavirus recession  1,058,325 in the third week of March  than the worst week after the financial crisis, according to a CalMatters analysis19.

A battle is underway on Capitol Hill over extending the emergency funds, with Republicans favoring a lower 200-a-week payment to encourage Americans to go back to work faster. If the funds do expire, state lawmakers have proposed borrowing20 from the feds through a loophole to keep paying the extra 600 per week with California unemployment benefits.Whether additional safety net funds will be made available is a big question for working class residents, in particular renters staring down the end of short-term eviction21 protections. Working parents weighing whether to quit their jobs22 or reduce hours to supervise children starting school remotely are another large segment of the workforce at risk of falling through holes in the pandemic safety net23.How much the state will ultimately pay out in unemployment benefits  and who will be on the hook in the future to settle the tab  is a massive question for Californias financial future. Already, unemployment spending during the pandemic has eclipsed the states total annual budgets for higher education, transportation and prisons combined, and it far exceeds yearly spending on things like affordable housing. Expect a contentious battle in the coming months about raising more state revenue, either through more borrowing or new taxes.

scranton,Student vaccine mandates fall like dominoes,2022-04-15T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,"Good morning, California. Its Friday, April 15. Pan pulls bill, Newsom delays his Democratic state Sen. Richard Pan of Sacramento speaks at a news conference in Los Angeles on Jan. 24, 2022. Photo by Damian Dovarganes, AP Photo Within the space of a few hours on Thursday, Californias possible COVID-19 vaccine mandates for students were significantly scaled back and then postponed for at least a year  underscoring the political risk Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers might have taken on by ordering thousands of unvaccinated kids into distance learning in the middle of an election year. First, Democratic state Sen. Richard Pan of Sacramento tabled his controversial bill2 that would have required all children ages 0 to 17 to be vaccinated against COVID to attend school or child care in person. Support for the proposal had been wavering for weeks, CalMatters Elizabeth Aguilera reports3. That move defaulted the state back to Newsoms vaccine mandate4, which is much looser than Pans  among other things, it allows for personal belief exemptions and wouldnt require kids to get vaccinated until the semester after federal regulators fully approve the shot for their age group. But then the California Department of Public Health  part of Newsoms administration  announced plans5 to delay the governors mandate until July 1, 2023, at the earliest to ensure sufficient time for successful implementation of new vaccine requirements. Postponing the mandate could prompt some public health officials and parents to accuse Newsom of putting students and teachers health at risk and endangering vulnerable communities. But keeping the mandate in place  when just 33.9 of children ages 5-11 and 66.4 of kids 12-17 are fully vaccinated, according to state data6  could be tantamount to blocking tens of thousands of students from attending campus and forcing them back into online learning. Black and Latino kids, who have lower vaccination rates than white and Asian children, would be disproportionately impacted7. Pan Until childrens access to COVID vaccination is greatly improved, I believe that a statewide policy to require COVID vaccination in schools is not the immediate priority, although it is an appropriate safety policy for many school districts in communities with good vaccine access. Pans decision to hold his bill is also the most concrete indication yet that Democratic lawmakers aggressive slate of vaccine proposals8 is facing an increasingly uphill battle9 in a state that just last week announced it no longer recommends quarantine10 for asymptomatic people exposed to COVID. Also tabled11 Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks contentious bill that would have required employers to mandate COVID vaccinations for their workers and independent contractors. Last week, Pan postponed for the second time12 a critical hearing on his proposal to withhold state funding from law enforcement agencies that oppose public health orders. Three other vaccine bills have not yet been scheduled13 for a hearing. Meanwhile, next Tuesday, a key committee is slated to consider14 a contentious proposal that would reclassify the sharing of COVID-19misinformation by doctors and surgeonsas unprofessional conduct that would result in disciplinary action.

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was gathering comments on its plan to make permanent emergency rules adopted during the pandemic to increase good conduct credit earning rates20 for inmates not sentenced to death or life without parole  but was apparently unable to mute the more than 130 conference call participants who werent speaking at any given moment. The result Many callers testimonies were interrupted by sneezes, laughter, other participants screaming MUTE YOUR PHONE!, or McDonalds commercials playing in the background. One caller admonished the state prison system21 The fact you guys cant even run a teleconference call speaks volumes about what youre doing for public safety. A Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesperson told FOX40s Ashley Zavala22 We apologize for any inconvenience, but appreciate the publics patience with this process, and can assure that people were heard, all comments were recorded, and will be included in the next steps in the rulemaking process. The spokesperson said the department had received more than 3,300 comments on the proposed rules, including those submitted by mail or email.

Auditor slams State Bar Image via iStock The State Bar of California, which oversees the states 250,000 lawyers26, has a weak disciplinary process that has resulted in some attorneys repeatedly violating professional standards and putting the public at risk, according to a scathing Thursday report27 from Acting State Auditor Michael Tilden. Lawmakers last year ordered an audit of the State Bar after a Los Angeles Times investigation28 found that Tom Girardi  a prominent Democratic Party donor who appeared alongside his third wife, Erika, on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills  remained in good standing despite misappropriating 2 million from the families of people killed in an Indonesian plane crash and racking up hundreds of other complaints and lawsuits. The Bar is also investigating whether Orange County attorney John Eastman violated ethics laws in advising former President Donald Trump on how to challenge the 2020 election results, the Orange County Register reports29.In the meantime, his license remains in good standing. Other key takeaways from the audit The Bar prematurely closed some cases that warranted further investigation and potential discipline. For example, although one attorney was the subject of 165 complaints over seven years, the Bar has yet to impose any discipline and resolved many of the complaints through private letters.The Bar failed to adequately investigate some attorneys. In one case, it closed 87 complaints against an attorney who was later federally convicted of money laundering.The Bar doesnt address conflicts of interest between its staff and the attorneys they investigate. In fact, it failed to do so in more than one-third of the cases reviewed by auditors.Ruben Duran, board chair for the State Bar30 Strengthening the discipline system is our number one priority, and we are committed to incorporating the audit findings into our ongoing efforts. 3. Workplace harassment unit at crossroads Photo via Pixabay The State Bar isnt the only entity under scrutiny. State lawmakers are evaluating possible changes to the Workplace Conduct Unit, which was formed in the wake of the MeToo movement to create a new, independent process for legislative employees to file and resolve harassment complaints. But the new unit has been plagued with problems, according to a San Francisco Chronicle investigation31 Some people who reported harassment said they were then investigated themselves32, while others said their reports to supervisors didnt result in investigations at all. Meanwhile, some investigations have dragged on for years. And concerns have cropped up that the unit isnt truly independent, as legislative leaders have the final say over an investigations outcome.

scranton,Sticker shock as CA gas prices pass $6/gallon,2022-05-19T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,"Gov. Gavin Newsom  apparently sensing that skyrocketing inflation rates might top rising COVID rates2 on many Californians list of concerns  pivoted from vaccines to the soaring cost of living while speaking Wednesday at a Bakersfield clinic3 after receiving his second booster shot. Newsom We are proposing an 18.1 billion additional package of relief4 to address the pressures, the cost pressures, the inflationary pressures, that everybodys feeling. We recognize the world were living in, the anxiety and stress so many people are facing. But this state is better positioned than any other state to address those issues head-on, and we look forward to making real on these promises by finalizing budget negotiations with the Legislature5 and getting those checks out. Senate Republican Leader Scott Wilk of Lancaster tweeted6 To use Gavin Newsom-style lingo, CA Democrats have left CAs most vulnerable in petrol purgatory by dangling the promise of relief. Republicans have a plan to provide it NOW by suspending the gas excise tax7. The cost of living was also a major focal point of a Wednesday event hosted by Californians Against Retail and Residential Theft, a new group composed largely of business associations8 that aims to educate lawmakers and the public about the growing wave of theft it says has been enabled by Proposition 479. Amid high-profile smash-and-grab-robberies10 and rising voter concerns about crime11, Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike introduced a variety of bills12 to toughen the 2014 voter-approved ballot measure that reduced penalties for certain theft and drug offenses  to no avail13. David Nelson, director of public policy for the California Asian Chamber of Commerce, told me The overarching point, its true  it is a political calculation. And I think thats why we continue to face headwinds within the Capitol. But look, it is an election year14 and we are socializing these issues from a political perspective with candidates. One particularly powerful argument, the group seemed to suggest the impact on everyday Californians pocketbooks. Richard Wardwell, president of Superior Grocers and member of the California Grocers Association As a business, if Im making 100 a day in profit and I lose 100 in theft, I now have zero profit. So in order to make a profit, I have to raise retail prices. So you have the rising cost of fuel, you have the rising cost of labor, you have the rising cost of theft, the rising cost of insurance If an employee approaches a person stealing and gets hurt, then the workers comp component goes into play and thats a significant impact to the business as well. So all of that relates back to the cost on the shelf and how people can afford to buy it.

Photo by Mike Blake, ReutersFrom CalMatters health reporter Ana B. Ibarra19 California health authorities are investigating whether Kaiser Permanente is providing adequate and timely mental health coverage to the more than 9 million residents it serves, the states Department of Managed Health Care said Wednesday. The department received a 20 increase in behavioral health complaints for Kaiser in 2021 compared to 2020, spokesperson Rachel Arrezola said in an email. It plans to conduct a non-routine survey into Kaisers provider network, its appointment scheduling and follow-up processes, and care response times, among other things.The investigation follows years of mounting pressure from patients, advocates and even Kaisers own mental health providers, who have repeatedly voiced concerns about and gone on strikes to protest months-long appointment wait times20. Kaiser spokesperson Steve Shivinsky said the health care giant has been on a multiyear journey to improve its mental health care system, including by expanding virtual care, embedding mental health professionals in more settings and looking for innovative ways to grow its workforce. But, Shivinsky said, challenges remain. Shivinsky The need for mental health care in America has never been greater, and at the same time harder to deliver. The national shortage of mental health clinicians was a crisis before the pandemic and the pandemic has set us all back. We also know the pandemic has strained our mental health clinicians. The National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents Kaisers mental health clinicians, said Kaiser is unprepared to comply with a state law21  set to go into effect July 1  that will require all health plans to provide follow-up mental health therapy appointments within ten business days. The union said Kaiser should not be allowed to grow its Medi-Cal presence, as outlined in a controversial no-bid contract proposal22 currently making its way through the Legislature, until the state can guarantee that Kaiser will be able to meet access standards as required by law. 2 A big day at the Capitol A night view of the California State Capitol dome in Sacramento.

scranton,Is this the 'Year of the Parent' in CA ?,2022-02-17T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,"That was San Francisco Parent Coalition Executive Director Meredith Dodsons assessment2 of the citys voters decisively ejecting3 three school board members from office in a Tuesday recall election4. The message to elected officials  ignore parents at your peril  might be the clearest statewide takeaway from a recall entrenched in local politics5 and whose possible ripple effects will likely also be mostly local. They could potentially affect the political fates of District Attorney Chesa Boudin6, whos facing a recall election in June, and of Mayor London Breed7, who will appoint the three board members replacements and is facing reelection herself in 2023. San Francisco voters will also decide in June whether to reform the citys recall process8. The San Francisco Chronicle editorial board argued9 that the recall was less about frustration over mask mandates or progressive policies than it was about the boards general incompetence and its failure to reopen schools in a timely way. But now that campuses have reopened their doors across the state, angry parents seem likely to focus on other controversial policies, such as masks. Newsom will likely face more questions about his school mask plan today, when he is expected to unveil more10 of his long-awaited endemic strategy for dealing with COVID. Los Angeles Times columnist Mark Barabak11 Parents of all political stripes have emerged as one of the most potent forces in campaigns and elections today, and woe to anyone seen as standing in the way of their kids education. Indeed, the pandemic has inspired some parents to run for office themselves. That includes Jonathan Zachreson, an independent-turned-Republican and Roseville father of three who founded an advocacy group called Reopen California Schools amid the pandemic. Zachreson is running for the state Assembly to, as he put it12, keep fighting to bring back normalcy for our kids.

Is California in climate trouble? A man walks past an oil rig in Huntington Beach on Dec. 2, 2020. Photo by Ronen Tivony, ReutersThough addressing climate change may be a top priority for Newsom and legislative leaders, three Wednesday reports illuminate some of the challenges California faces in meeting its ambitious climate goals23 Its landmark climate program may not be effective enough. California has already pledged to reevaluate its carbon market24, which allows oil companies, utilities and other polluters to buy or trade dwindling amounts of credits allowing them to emit greenhouse gasses. A new report from a panel advising state officials found those companies have saved 321 million credits  enough to jeopardize the states goal of slashing emissions 40 below 1990 levels by 2030, the Associated Press reports25. Labor groups are divided over how California should support oil and gas workers as the state transitions away from fossil fuels26. That poses a problem for Democratic Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi of Torrance, whos expected to introduce a bill that would mandate a statewide just transition plan, CalMatters Jesse Bedayn reports27. Wildfire victims may not be adequately compensated. A trust PGampE set up to repay its wildfire victims is about 1.3 billion short of promised funds due to the beleaguered utilitys depressed stock price. Though the trusts director and other advocates are calling on state lawmakers to expand access to a state-run wildfire insurance fund28 so victims can get paid, they dont seem eager to do so. PGampE is so toxic, theyve been such a bad corporate entity that no one wants to do anything that appears to be helping them, John Trotter, a retired justice who runs the PGampE Fire Victim Trust, told the Sacramento Bee29. 3.

Photo by Eric Risberg, AP Photo Of the about 13 million low-income Californians covered by Medi-Cal  the states health care insurance program for the poor  more than half a million children, pregnant women and working disabled adults are required to pay monthly premiums. But that could change under two proposals currently being considered in Sacramento, CalMatters Elizabeth Aguilera reports30. Newsom has proposed spending 59 million this year and 89 million annually to reduce Medi-Cal premiums to zero  while leaving open the possibility that future administrations could revive them. Meanwhile, Democratic Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula of Fresno wants to eliminate premiums altogether, describing them as a relic of the past. Three key data points from Elizabeths story31 that advocates say demonstrate why premiums should end California waived Medi-Cal premiums during the pandemic  but only for patients who requested them. Fewer than half did. California is one of just four states that charges premiums for children enrolled in its Medicaid program. Although the state collected 63.7 million in Medi-Cal premiums in 2020, it only kept about 8 million after paying an outside vendor to manage billing, collection and other administrative costs.

scranton,Recall puts elections chief in political pickle,2021-09-01T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,"Theres also Secretary of State Shirley Weber  who has been thrust into the awkward position of administering an election that could oust from office the very man who appointed her to the role1. Weber, a San Diego Democrat and former state lawmaker2, faces a politically precarious task defending Californias recall process  even if she thinks it has some serious problems3  and encouraging residents to vote4 without giving the impression of supporting Newsom. The trickiness of this balancing act was evident Tuesday, when the Associated Press reported5 that California election officials are spending 16 million on a voter education campaign intended to boost turnout  a move that will likely benefit Newsom, given the states nearly 2 to 1 ratio of registered Democrats to Republicans. The campaign is officially nonpartisan, but the California Republican Party has accused the agency running the campaign  the Sax Agency of Los Angeles  of being pro-Democrat, citing its 2020 work with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and an Instagram post6 celebrating President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris win. During the November 2020 election, then-Secretary of State Alex Padillas office came under fire for awarding a 35 million voter education contract to a firm tied to Bidens presidential campaign7. Joe Kocurek, Webers press secretary, told me Tuesday that the two leaders of the voter education campaign are registered as Republican and no party preference. We have that perspective intentionally, he said, adding, The fact is, we have a state full of voters of both parties. Elections are supposed to reflect the will of the people, and you dont have that if people dont turn out. Nevertheless, critics questioned the appropriateness of Weber and Attorney General Rob Bonta  another Newsom appointee, whos publicly endorsed the governor  holding a press conference8 to remind Californians of their voting rights ahead of the recall. During the event, Weber emphasized that its a sacred part of this democracy for every Californian to vote in this election and every election. But she also appeared to stop mid-sentence when explaining the recall ballot, potentially to choose more neutral words to describe the second question. Weber Its a ballot with two questions on it, really, do you or do you not want to recall the governor, simple yes or no. And the second question is if for some reason you want  he is recalled, who would you want as his replacement? However, Republicans praised Weber for adhering to the letter of the law and not granting Newsoms appeal to list himself as a Democrat on the ballot9 despite his lawyers missing the filing deadline to do so. Shes also been the defendant in other high-profile lawsuits one from recall frontrunner Larry Elder10, who challenged tax return requirements he won and got on the ballot and one from three California voters11 who argued the recall was unconstitutional they lost. During election season, though, the line between state official and politician can get blurry. At an Oakland vaccine clinic on Tuesday, Newsom noted that 80 of eligible Californians have received at least one shot12 and encouraged hesitant residents to get vaccinated. But then he pivoted to campaign mode. Simple request, he said. Vote no and go to the mailbox. Simple no vote. Dont even turn the page and consider the other 46 questions that are being asked. Simple no vote and turn that ballot in.

Newsom said21 the money, which will ultimately reach two out of every three residents, was intended to provide direct relief for Californians hit hardest by the pandemic. But potentially up to 2 million of the states most vulnerable residents  low-income retirees, veterans and disabled Californians who receive government benefits and dont work  were excluded. And that omission, they told CalMatters Jackie Botts22 for the latest in the Building Bloc series on key voters, may have cost Newsom their support. Still, Newsom got some good news Tuesday when FiveThirtyEight, a national polling aggregation site, found23 that 51 of likely California voters would keep him in office, compared to 45.4 who would remove him. The dramatic change  a few weeks ago, barely more than a percentage point separated the two groups24  appears to be due to SurveyUSA adjusting its methodology25 in its latest poll. 2.

scranton,Another gas rebate plan — but little action,2022-04-29T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,"CA faces budget paradox Gas prices at a gas station in Sacramento on March 14, 2022. Photo by Miguel Gutierrez Jr., CalMatters A group of California lawmakers on Thursday churned out the latest idea for putting money back in the pockets of residents struggling with sky-high gas prices  but despite the growing pile of proposals2, a consensus seems as elusive as ever. The bipartisan California Problem Solvers Caucus3 plan suspend the states gas excise tax for one year, ensure 100 of the savings are passed on to consumers, and use part of the states massive budget surplus to replace the lost tax revenue for vital infrastructure projects. Assemblymember Adam Gray, a Merced Democrat The most important takeaway from this announcement is that there is now a proposal in California to suspend the gas tax with bipartisan support. But, as Senate Republican Leader Scott Wilk of Santa Clarita was quick to point out, his caucus had proposed the very same idea last year4. While bipartisan support is welcome, it only matters if the Democrats can help us get the proposal across the finish line, he said. And its unclear if they can. Alex Stack, a spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom, told me in a statement theres no guarantee under this proposal that the benefits will be passed on to Californians whove been paying more at the pump, and not just go back to oil companies and corporations. Furthermore, the Democratic leaders of the state Assembly and Senate have made it abundantly clear that suspending gas taxes isnt their preferred form of relief. To implement Newsoms proposal to suspend5 Julys scheduled increase to the gas and diesel excise tax, lawmakers would need to pass it by Sunday. But the Legislature has yet to introduce any bills on the matter.Stack It is clear now that the Legislature will not act in time to provide that immediate, limited relief. Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon6 told me earlier this week We stand ready to act as soon as the governor joins us in supporting a plan that provides stronger relief for California families. Top Senate Democrats unveiled their own relief plan7 as part of a larger budget blueprint Thursday, about two weeks before Newsom is slated to present a revised version of his January budget proposal8. Lawmakers and the governor must agree on a budget framework by June 159 for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Senate Democrats pitch 8 billion in cash rebates, in the form of 200 checks to individuals earning less than 125,000 and each taxpayer and child in families earning less than 250,000. Their budget blueprint also projects California will have a whopping 68 billion surplus significantly more than the record 45.7 billion surplus10 Newsoms administration predicted in January. The Associated Press has more details11 on their spending proposals. Atkins12 This budget means were able to help even more people, bolster their ability to achieve their dreams, and ensure there will be both resources and a more equitable system in place now, and for future generations of Californians. Maybe. The nonpartisan Legislative Analysts Office, which advises state lawmakers on fiscal issues, recently reported13 that in more than 95 of the 10,000 possible revenue and economic scenarios analyzed by the office, the state faces a budget problem by 2025-26. Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek wrote this week14 The central implication of our findings is stark and suggests that in the interest of fiscal resilience, the Legislature should consider rejecting a substantial portion of the governors January spending proposals.

The truth isThe vast majority of plastic cannot be recycled, and therecycling rate has never surpassed 9.Every week, we consumethe equivalent ofa credit cards worth of plasticthrough the water we drink, the food we eat and the air we breathe.As CalMatters environment reporter Nadia Lopez notes, most plastics are sourced from fossil fuel chemicals and dont fully erode. Instead, they dissolve into smaller pieces called microplastics, which leach toxic chemicals22 that endanger human health, pollute oceans and natural habitats23 and poison wildlife24. New research published Tuesday25 by UC Davis scientists found that microplastics also help spread germs, contaminating fish and the humans and other animals that eat them.

Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and denounce the House investigation into Jan. 6 has spawned an internecine war within the GOP, with trad conservatives blasting the decision and Trumpists sticking to the line that the Capitol attack was merely a protest, not a riot or an insurrection. United front?  Much of the controversy stems from the statement going out on RNC letterhead. Law-and-order Republicans say it reads a tacit endorsement of the Jan. 6 rioters, which are described as ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse. Half and half  Still, some top GOP officials are playing both sides of the issue. Count Sen. Joe Gruters among them. The Republican Party of Florida Chair co-sponsored the resolution and gave it a yay vote in absentia but insists he believes all who broke the law should be held accountable. or patriots? Joe Gruters walks a thin line in the debate among Republicans over Jan. 6. Care to explain?  I was in Session in Tallahassee so did not vote in person but gave my proxy to Florida National Committeewoman Kathleen King. Prior to the meeting, I discussed with both the Florida NCW and National Committeeman Peter Feaman, and we all signed on as co-sponsors to the resolution. Muddy waters  Florida Politics asked him point-blank whether he thought the events of Jan. 6 were legitimate political discourse. His answer I understand why people were so upset, but there is no justification for breaking the law, especially those who damage property or attack law enforcement officers. Justice should prevail, and people that committed these acts should be held accountable. Many more people came to D.C. to peacefully protest what they thought was an injustice. Those ordinary citizens should not be harassed or targeted in any way.

Those ordinary citizens should not be harassed or targeted in any way.  DATELINE TALLY  House budgets 105.3 billion in spending plan8 via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics  The Florida House unveiled its proposed spending plan for the coming fiscal year on Friday, clocking in at 105.3 billion. While the number is about 4 billion larger than what the state is spending in the current fiscal year, the amount falls shy of the 108.6 billion budget plan the Senate published earlier Friday. Together, both are north of DeSantis 99.7 billion proposal, but DeSantis total dollar amount is near the Houses top figure when considering the federal spending that helped balloon the Legislatures budget beyond past marks. In a statement, House Speaker Chris Sprowls said the Houses budget proposal builds on last years plan by investing state dollars in a strategic, intentional way. Senate unveils 108.6 billion budget with pay hikes for state workers9 via Gray Rohrer of Florida Politics  Low-paid state workers would see raises and K-12 schools would get a funding boost, as would nearly every portion of the state budget under a spending plan released Friday by the Senate. The 108.6 billion proposal would be a more than 7 billion increase on the current years budget, thanks largely to an infusion of federal stimulus dollars given to states to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Senate President Wilton Simpson has pushed to increase the pay for low-paid state workers by raising the minimum wage to 15. A constitutional amendment passed by voters in 2020 will push the minimum wage for all workers to 15 by 2026, but Simpson says the early increase is needed to recruit and retain workers in needed areas. Both Chris Sprowls and Wilton Simpson release blockbuster budget proposals. Senate, House snub Ron DeSantis push to increase cancer research to 100 million10 via Christine Jordan Sexton of Florida Politics  There are plenty of differences between the proposed 47 billion-plus health care spending proposals the Senate and House rolled out this week. But the chambers are in lockstep in deciding not to include an additional 37 million to increase cancer research and treatment, as advocated by DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis. The Governor and the First Lady have already noticed the snub, both of whom took to social media after the House released its proposed spending plan late Thursday afternoon. Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in Florida. I have recommended to the Legislature 100 million for cancer research so we can fight this terrible disease, DeSantis said in a Twitter post. Senate pitches cash for new state planes11 via Jason Delgado of Florida Politics  The Senate unveiled plans this week to add two new planes to the states aviation fleet. The buy would cost taxpayers 26.5 million and fill a void left by former Republican Gov. Scott. Scott in 2011 sold off two state planes as part of a campaign promise to limit abuses by government officials. A multimillionaire, he instead traveled aboard his private jet. While the sale made good on the campaign promise, it left future Governors and cabinet members without wings. Sen. Ben Albritton said the buy is a move to replenish the fleet. He serves as chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Environment and General Government. Is DeSantis getting what he wants in Floridas early budget proposals?12 via Kirby Wilson and Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times  DeSantis and top Republican leaders in the House and Senate have put their cards on the table. This week, legislators unveiled the first round of proposed House and Senate budgets. The Governor included nearly 310 million to hospitals that serve the most Medicaid patients. Neither the House nor the Senate included that money in their initial health care budgets this week. One of DeSantis recent talking points has been his proposal to cut the gas tax for several months this year. This idea isnt included in the Senates budget. Meanwhile Seminole Tribe says its gaming rights, Floridas revenue payments are at risk again13 via Scott Powers of Florida Politics  The Seminole Tribe of Florida has charged in a court filing that if a judge breathes new life into a North Florida casino initiative, and it gets on the ballot and wins approval, that could infringe on the Tribes exclusive rights. If that happens, the Tribe cautioned, then the Seminoles hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue sharing payments to Florida, only recently resumed after a three-year dispute, could be disrupted again. Based on those arguments, Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper accepted the Tribe and its political committee, Standing Up For Florida, as interveners in a lawsuit filed earlier this week by Florida Voters In Charge, which is trying to resurrect its North Florida casino campaign.TALLY 2   8216A recipe for disaster? Florida GOP wants to add new requirements to vote by mail14 via Skyler Swisher of the Orlando Sentinel  A GOP-led voting overhaul would add new requirements for casting a mail ballot that one Central Florida election supervisor is warning could be a recipe for disaster. Starting in 2024, voters would have to provide the last four digits of their drivers license or state ID number on their ballot. If they dont have a state ID, the last four digits of their Social Security number could be submitted. Ballots wont be counted if those identifying digits arent provided or dont match the numbers on file with the elections office. Election supervisors must contact people whose ballots arent correctly completed and allow them to fix problems. The deadline to complete that process, known in political jargon as curing a ballot, is two days after Election Day. rough patch Florida is considering adding more speed bumps in the vote-by-mail process. Nursing homes struggle with staffing Legislature considers loosening standard of care15 via Hannah Critchfield and Kirby Wilson of Florida Politics  A bill to loosen staffing standards at Florida nursing homes was initially drafted with the help of one of the states most powerful long-term care lobbying interests. Under the measure, Senate Bill 804, nursing homes that fail to meet state-mandated staff requirements would no longer be barred from admitting new residents. It would also broaden which kinds of employees can be counted in these mandatory staffing minimums intended to keep residents safe. Bill changing Florida nursing home standards was written by the industry, emails show16 via Hannah Critchfield and Kirby Wilson of the Tampa Bay Times Senate property insurance package takes aim at Carlos Beruff  A Senate property insurance bill SB 1728 would change the qualifications to serve on the board of state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corp., potentially making current Chair Beruff ineligible for reappointment. Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida reported that the language would require board members to have at least 10 years of experience in the insurance industry. The current requirements require members to have insurance experience, but there is no explicit definition for how much or what kind of experience. The change comes after Beruff proposed selling policies directly to consumers to avoid paying commissions to insurance agents. House virtual school plan riles choice advocates  The House K-12 budget proposal would block school districts from contracting with Florida Virtual School for online education and prevent virtual charter schools from enrolling out-of-county students. As reported by Andrew Atterbury of POLITICO Florida, opponents of the plan say it is counteractive to school choice. About half of Floridas 103,000 online K-12 students are currently enrolled in FLVS, and about a fifth are enrolled in FLVS franchises, where district teachers assist students in working through FLVS curricula. About 40 districts operate FLVS franchises and school choice advocates say it is a good option for parents who want their children to have access to clubs and counseling that are not available with a purely online school. Senate passes bills on addiction, child hearing loss17 via Brendan Farrington of The Associated Press  While Democratic and Republican lawmakers have had a contentious debate on issues like abortion and immigration this year, the two sides came together Thursday to pass 20 bills quickly, almost all unanimously. The legislation included approving new state legislative districts, authorizing schools to stock and use medicines to counteract an opioid overdose and requiring insurance companies to provide hearing aid coverage for children. Democrats and Republicans praised a bill that would expand the use of overdose-reversing drugs, including allowing schools to stock naloxone, which could be administered by staff trained to recognize an opioid overdose. Jason Shoaf backs bill to end concealed weapons licensure18 via David Adlerstein of The Apalachicola Times  A bill in the Florida House that would do away with Floridas concealed weapons permitting process has the strong support of State Rep. Shoaf, and while a companion bill in the Florida Senate has yet to be filed, State Sen. Loranne Ausley does not share his enthusiasm. House Bill 103, a measure filed as it has in years past by Rep. Anthony Sabatini, would remove laws that require a concealed-weapons permit in Florida. Since the end product has yet to be marked up in committee, it is as yet unclear the extent to which the bill would allow the public display of firearms, with no restrictions, and Shoaf has some reservations about unfettered open carry. Sizzling housing market in Florida hurts many, but help slow to come from Legislature19 via John Kennedy of the Tallahassee Democrat  Floridas white-hot housing market is setting new pricing records almost daily, but thousands of homeowners and renters are being scorched, unable to find anything they can afford. Now, talk of the unfolding crisis is coursing through the Florida Legislature, with calls for lawmakers to do something. The bottom line is the American dream is slipping away for more and more people every day, Sen. Gary Farmer said. A lack of apartment supply, less land available for new construction, and pandemic-driven changes like the arrival of remote workers from even costlier states have powered up the price of available homes and rentals. Gary Farmer says the American dream is slipping away. Will help come from the Legislature? Florida Chamber political tool identifies swing seats on latest legislative maps20 via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics  The Florida Chamber of Commerce unveiled its exclusive 2022 Florida Partisan Performance Index map during a special webcast to its members Friday. Applying the tools to Floridas just-approved redrawn legislative maps, Chamber analysts said there are few swing seats but plenty of drama in store this year. The Chamber tool studies precinct-level data on voter performance based on the past five years. That includes how voters in the district cast ballots in the last two presidential elections and the 2018 gubernatorial race. In this case, the new district came out as R1, closer, actually, and its trended more purple over time. Overall, the new maps result in fewer swing districts where both Democrats and Republicans can play. Based on Chamber election analysis, the new House map has 15 true swing districts the Senate map S 8058 has just three. MORE TALLY  Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo is unfit to serve21 via Lauren Book for the Orlando Sentinel  I can think of no more important time than during a multi-year pandemic for our state to be guided by a physician who not only understands pandemic science but is willing and able to explain his plan for keeping all of us as safe as possible. Sadly, Dr. Ladapo is not that person. When Dr. Ladapo was asked clear questions about his departments role in addressing the pandemic, he offered non-answers, obfuscations and demonstrations of verbal jiu-jitsu. For starters, he has supported and had publicly promoted widely debunked theories of how to deal with this virus. This is unacceptable and disrespectful to the institution of the Florida Senate and to the people of this great state. Joseph Ladapo just doesnt have the chops, says Lauren Book. Rocky Hanna blasts GOP lawmaker as bully for retaliatory state budget item after masks fight22 via Ana Goñi-Lessan of the Tallahassee Democrat  Leon County Schools Superintendent Hanna is once again at odds with the states Republican leaders who, with a new proposed line item in the next state budget, are targeting school districts who defied the Governors ban of mask mandates last year. House Republicans introduced legislation this week that would slash salaries from school districts, of which Leon was one, that implemented mandatory mask rules after DeSantis prohibited them in schools. In a K-12 Appropriations Subcommittee meeting, state Rep. Randy Fine proposed a line item in the budget that would take away 200 million from a dozen school districts that defied the Governors emergency rule that banned mask mandates and give that money to other districts. Before even passing, the Dont Say Gay bill is already hurting Floridas children23 via Fabiola Santiago of the Miami Herald  Oh, Florida legislators, the harm you do from your ivory tower up there in Tallahassee. Elaine Acosta Gonzlez, a concerned parent who reached out to me after reading my column about the wrong-headed Dont Say Gay bill moving through the Legislature, says her 15-year-old daughter has been talking about the topic at home. The bill would silence gay children, their teachers and education advocates by banning the discussion of sexuality and gender identification in Floridas public schools. Indeed, youth should have a prominent voice in the discussion of the bill and so should the science- and data-oriented experts who know the place of sexuality in education. Like parents, these experts also are concerned about the damage lawmakers who introduced the bill already are doing to set back the lives of gay and trans children in Florida. Why put more limits on public petition campaigns?24 via Bill Cotterell of the Tallahassee Democrat  Theres a proposal ready for a vote in the Florida House HJR 1127 that would limit the subject matter of petition campaigns to procedural matters, the structure of state government and the Constitution itself. A companion measure in the Senate hasnt moved, at the midway point of the Legislative Session, but maybe Republicans who run both chambers are just waiting for the House version to cross the rotunda. Keith Truenow defends bill disbanding Lake County Water Authority25 via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics  Rep. Truenow responded to a recent article criticizing his bill HB 1105 to disband the Lake County Water Authority, pitching it as an attempt to eliminate duplicitous government. The Feb. 4 article by Kevin Spear, casts the Lake County Water Authority as a venerable and independent guardian of Central Florida waters and asserts that Truenows bill is motivated by contentious dealings he has had with the water authority. Truenow and the Lake County Water Authority often sparred over pollution flowing from ditches at Truenows large, turf-grass growing operation north of Lake Apopka. Food fight Time to scrape Floridas strawberry shortcake bill down the garbage disposal26 via Brian Burgess of The Capitolist  Sen. Danny Burgess wants to have his cake and eat it too. Burgess represents Plant City, the heart of Floridas strawberry industry. So, he cant be blamed for sponsoring a bill that would promote fresh, Florida-grown strawberries, but he must bear responsibility for trying to make strawberry shortcake, which is barely a dessert at all, the official state dessert when better options could have been chosen.

STATEWIDE  Voting fraud conspiracy group has pipeline to Governor as election changes considered29 via Zac Anderson of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune  Started by the Lakewood Ranch leader of a pro-Trump womens organization, Defend Florida has mobilized an army of volunteers to collect affidavits that raise questions about whether voters cast legal 2020 ballots. The group has collected more than 5,000 affidavits in 34 counties, implying each is a possible instance of voter fraud. The claims appear to be getting serious consideration from GOP officials. Defend Florida co-founder Caroline Wetherington said the group met with DeSantis top staff on six occasions while also securing meetings with Secretary of State Laurel Lee and top GOP legislators. However, local elections and law enforcement officials have dismissed Defend Floridas claims. Despite being rebuffed by local authorities, Defend Florida still is highly active.

Gancarski of Florida Politics  DeSantis continues to calibrate messaging around commercial drivers, closing out the week with a campaign email predicated around a slogan his policy team broke out two weeks ago. The same Truck Yeah slogan seen on signs at a January news conference in Bowling Green resurfaced in an email Friday from his re-election campaign to political supporters. In the email, DeSantis concerns were somewhat more global than the commercial drivers license training money doled out to state colleges in January. People across the world are finally standing up and fighting back, DeSantis asserted. 8216Possibly illegal behavior Ashley Moody blasts GoFundMe after Freedom Convoy flip-flop31 via A.G.

Ladapo said in a phone interview that good science requires respect for all perspectives.

Florida reports 1,324 deaths, 132,622 cases this week38 via Caroline Catherman of the Orlando Sentinel  The Florida Department of Health reported 132,622 new coronavirus cases this week among Florida residents to bring the cumulative total to 5,610,370. With 1,324 more fatalities on record, 66,279 Florida residents have died. This weeks 1,324 deaths reflect an increase from the 1,192 reported last week, but deaths can take several days or weeks to be reported. The majority of the newly reported deaths are people who died before this week. The death count had not reached anywhere near September levels when nearly 2,500 new deaths were reported multiple weeks in a row. Four stealth omicron cases found in Florida39 via Chris Persaud of The Palm Beach Post  At least four cases of the so-called stealth omicron variant have been discovered in Florida as the states death toll increased by 1,000 for the second time in as many weeks. Two peoples test results in Miami-Dade County confirmed the presence of a new mutation of omicron. The lab did not immediately provide more information about the infected people. Helix Laboratories confirmed two cases earlier this week discovered in Florida.

The weekly number of COVID-19 cases in Alachua County is declining, as is the positivity rate40 via Gershon Harrell of The Gainesville Sun Floridas fourth COVID-19 surge came fast and strong. Heres what the omicron wave tells us about whats ahead.41 via Cindy Krischer Goodman of the Orlando Sentinel  By now, scientists expected the omicron surge in Florida to be nearly over. The new forecast projects about four more weeks before the omicron wave diminishes to give Floridians a respite. Most experts see hope in the much larger immune population in the state. Between those who caught the virus during the omicron surge and the increasing number of vaccinated and boosted people, much of Florida should have some protection against future variants. We wont know the exact toll of omicron for several weeks, notes Scott Herr, a computer scientist who tracks COVID-19 in Florida. My guesstimate would be somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 deaths, possibly more. The biggest unknown is how long the tail will be from the peak until the wave ends.

I see a lot of people that are hungry for fair and honest representation. I have talked to a number of people who are happy to have seen the announcement that Democratic U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy is not running for re-election, Duke said.

CORONA ECONOMICS  Biden administration tells Congress that key coronavirus funds are dwindling49 via Tony Romm and Jeff Stein  Nearly all of the money in a key federal program to boost coronavirus testing, therapeutics, and vaccines appears to have been committed or already shelled out, raising the potential that the Biden administration may have to ask Congress to approve additional aid. The dwindling funds reflect an uptick in spending as the White House in recent months has labored aggressively to battle back the rise of the omicron variant. While top officials say they are confident in their ability to weather the latest surge, they have started exploring whether more money might be needed to protect the public against future variants. the bank Federal funding for COVID-19 testing and the like is almost gone. Despite omicron surge, businesses desperate to find and keep workers50 via Abha Bhattarai of The Washington Post  Omicron was supposed to wreak havoc on the labor market. But it didnt. The jump in January hiring has underscored the economys growing capacity to weather renewed waves of surging coronavirus cases, suggesting a tight job market is forcing companies to retain workers now that hiring new ones has become costlier and more difficult. Unlike previous waves of the virus, when businesses were quick to pause operations and lay off workers, many are now going to greater lengths to hang on to their employees. Overall, U.S. employers added 467,000 jobs in January, with much of those gains concentrated in hotels, restaurants, retailers and other services.  MORE CORONA  The world is likely sicker than it has been in 100 years51 via David Luhnow, Joanna Sugden and Rajesh Roy of The Wall Street Journal  The world is living through a unique moment In the past five or six weeks, the omicron coronavirus variant has likely gotten more people sick than any similar period since the 1918-1919 flu pandemic, according to a global health expert. While omicron infections have peaked in many places, February is likely to see similar caseloads as the variant continues to spread before it flames out, causing worker shortages from hospitals to factories and spurring debate about COVID-19 restrictions, mainly since omicron appears to be causing less serious illness. hasnt been this sick since the Spanish Influenza outbreak of 1918. Omicron infections may not protect well against future spread52 via Caitlin Owens of Axios  The extent to which omicrons rapid spread leaves the world better off in its fight against COVID-19 depends on a few big questions, including how long infection-induced immunity actually lasts. Vaccinations and infections at high enough levels can form an immunity wall against the future spread of the virus. But if omicron infections ultimately dont contribute much to this wall, that leaves much of the world still vulnerable. When the coronavirus first emerged, no one had any immune protection. In the two years since, thats changed drastically, as hundreds of millions of people worldwide have become infected and billions have been vaccinated. Blood supplies run low as omicron limits donations53 via Rene Onque of The Wall Street Journal  Blood is in short supply in the U.S., with donation drives stalled amid COVID-19 and demand rising as people resume medical care they put off earlier in the pandemic. The number of people donating blood each month was 10 lower at the end of last year than before the pandemic began in February 2020. Blood drives at schools and colleges have decreased by 62 during the same time. Public-health experts say that shortages could leave hospitals unprepared for emergencies such as car accidents or natural disasters that can require a lot of blood for transfusions and urgent surgeries. After weathering the omicron crush, CVS and Walgreens removed their limits on buying at-home tests.54 via Esha Ray of The New York Times  For the past few months, those Americans who had been lucky enough to find at-home coronavirus tests in stores had been kept from buying more than a few at a time so that stores could keep up with the surging demand. But that is changing at nearly all CVS and Walgreens locations nationwide as of this week. A CVS spokesman, Matthew Blanchette, confirmed on Saturday that the pharmacy chain had increased its inventory of over-the-counter rapid test kits and removed all limits on those products at CVS Pharmacy locations nationwide and on CVS.com. A Walgreens representative also said on Saturday that because of improved in-stock conditions, the company had removed its purchase limit of at-home tests at almost all its locations.

The stricter nutrition standards, which cut sodium, require more whole grains and mandate more fruits and vegetables, were also partially relaxed during the Trump administration. One of former Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdues first moves was to Make School Meals Great Again by loosening rules for whole grains, sodium and flavored milk.

Democrats big dilemma Avoid Biden or embrace him?56 via Sean Sullivan and Marianna Sotomayor of The Washington Post  As Democrats gear up for a difficult midterm campaign, one of the biggest variables is Bidens popularity, which has fallen sharply amid his struggles to contain the pandemic, rising prices and foreign policy crises. Clear majorities now disapprove of the job Biden is doing, triggering uncomfortable conversations in the party about how much to incorporate him into their campaigns and prompting a range of early responses from Democrats in hard races. Midterm elections are influenced strongly by how voters feel about the sitting President, and many Democrats are trying to inoculate themselves by forging their own brands and even criticizing some of Bidens actions.

In censure of Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, RNC calls events of Jan. 6 legitimate political discourse64 via Gabby Orr of CNN  In a resolution formally censuring GOP Reps.

A Jan. 6 suspect died. Now the FBI has to prep for conspiracies.65 via Ryan J. Reilly of NBC News  A man featured on the FBIs website, wanted for assaulting police at the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack, died months ago. In the year since the Jan. 6 investigation began, the FBI has posted images of more than 500 individuals on its U.S. Capitol Violence webpage. More than 350 of those included on the page still havent been arrested, including dozens who have been successfully identified by online sleuths. Removing his image from the website now could spark additional conspiracy theories that could only be resolved through public identification, which would set off a fresh round of pain for a family still recovering from its loss. His removal from the list without being charged has prompted rampant conspiracy theories that he was acting as a plant to stoke the crowd.  EPILOGUE TRUMP  This was the week when Trump revealed all66 via Dan Balz of The Washington Post  Trump has told some big lies over the years. One of the biggest, it now is clear, came on Jan. 7, 2021, the day after his supporters assaulted the U.S. Capitol. On Jan. 6, as law enforcement officers fought valiantly against an armed mob of rioters attacking the Capitol, Trump remained in the White House, silent in the face of repeated efforts by advisers, family members and allies who pleaded with him to try to call a halt to the violence. The next day, in a videotaped address, he said, finally, that he was outraged by the heinous attack on the Capitol. He didnt mean it, as he made clear last weekend. Donald Trump has told many lies, but one stands out. The extreme ideas floating around Trump on how to overturn the election67 via Amber Phillips of The Washington Post  As Trump tried to hang on to power after his election loss, he surrounded himself with advisers, lawyers, and seemingly random people who were willing to give him ideas. We keep learning just how drastic some of those ideas were. The President appeared to take some more seriously than others, but it seems clear that Trump andor his top aides at least entertained the thought of seizing voting machines. A memo was circulated among Trump allies suggesting that the NSA could be used to try to prove a baseless claim about fraud. And thats just whats been revealed in reporting and from the congressional Jan. 6 investigation. Trump and allies try to redefine racism by casting White men as victims68 via Cleve R. Wootson Jr. of The Washington Post  Holding court at a political rally in Texas last week, Trump implied that he, a wealthy White man who was elected to an office almost exclusively held by White men, was also a victim of racism. Trumps claim referenced what he said were three radical vicious, racist prosecutors, one in Georgia, one in New York, one in Washington, all of them Black, who are investigating his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection and examining his business organizations finances. But his comments made him the latest in a line of conservatives claiming, loudly and frequently, that White men are also victims of racism. How Trumps political style smothered the last substance left in the GOP69 via Carlos Lozada of The Washington Post  Jeremy Peterss Insurgency is not the first attempt to take a long view of how the party of Lincoln became the party of Trump. Insurgency is persuasive in suggesting that the long-term transformation of the Republican Party is one in which a style of politics has overpowered and then suffocated any remnant of its substance. The Trump era in American politics can feel uniquely disruptive, but Peters highlights earlier episodes that, put together, leave Trump looking like an inevitable outcome rather than an unlikely outlier. Javanka in exile70 via Bob Norman of the Washingtonian  Ivanka Trumps world has certainly gotten smaller.

Its not unprecedented, Flynn insisted to Newsmax host Greg Kelly on Dec. 17. I mean, these people out there talking about martial law, like its something that weve never done, he said, adding, Im not calling for that. Flynn was, in fact, calling for sending the military to the contested states.

The men, Yoelvis Denis Hernandez and Luis Urra Montero, stole a tractor-trailer from a parking lot in South Florida that was loaded with 192 ventilators, worth about 3 million, that were bound for Miami International Airport for shipping to El Salvador by the U.S. Agency for International Development. low can you go? Yoelvis Denis Hernandez and Luis Urra Montero are accused of stealing 3M in ventilators meant for COVID-19 patients. Nicaraguan doctors quest for political asylum remains in limbo years after escape to Central Florida73 via Lisa Maria Garza of the Orlando Sentinel  More than three years after he fled Nicaragua seeking political asylum, Dr. Luis Rodolfo Ibarra is still waiting for a hearing in Orlando immigration court. Ibarra, 35, said he wants a judge to know that he put his oath as a doctor above government orders in 2018 when he treated wounded civilian protesters who sought to dismantle President Daniel Ortegas regime. A hearing for Ibarras asylum case was set for July in Orlando, then abruptly canceled because of COVID-19 concerns, his lawyer Rusten Hurd said. Online court records show there are no future hearings scheduled for Ibarras case, which has been consolidated with his wife and daughters requests for asylum. Rising antisemitism in South Florida and beyond fuels concern and determination in Jewish community74 via Anthony Man of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel  Drivers on Interstate 4 in Orlando last Sunday were confronted with a Nazi flag displayed on an overpass, along with a banner proclaiming Vax the Jews and listing the same website as the previous weekends flyers. The incidents are part of what Jewish community leaders and others said is a disturbing trend an increase in the number of antisemitic incidents, some violent, others aimed at instilling fear. Both locally and nationally, we have seen steady increases in antisemitism and all forms of bigotry over the past few years, said Lonny Wilk, interim regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in Florida. State of the city West Palm mayor talks about boom times, crime, expensive housing and water problem75 via Wayne Washington of The Palm Beach Post  Basking in West Palm Beachs economic boom times, Mayor Keith James declared that the state of our city today is strong, our economy is sound, and our state of mind is sturdy. The mayor touted the new office buildings sprouting up in the city, talked up partnerships with the University of Florida and Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, noted what he described as a drop in crime, and announced that hes increasing his goal for the construction of affordable housing units. While James said hes proud of the citys accomplishments over the past year, he is pushing his administration to do more. Housing, he said, is still too expensive for many. The city has been chipping away at homelessness but wants to do more on that front. Will Sheriff Gregory Tony face any penalty after investigation into his lies? What we know and dont know76 via Lisa Huriash of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel  DeSantis says hell decide whether to take any action against Tony after a state investigation concluded Broward Countys top cop lied on numerous forms about his murder arrest and other key parts of his past. Many outcomes could take place in the coming days The Governor soon could act to suspend Tony from office. He could wait for a state ethics panel to recommend whether any discipline or penalty is warranted  and delegate that task to the ethics panel. Or he could decide to do nothing at all. Tonys case can be a complicated matter to decide, said attorney Burnadette Norris-Weeks. The decision to remove an elected official from office can be subjective, Norris-Weeks said. Legal standards, quite frankly, can be a little blurry sometimes. deep Gregory Tony faces several possibilities many are not good.

Clearly frustrated by what high school spring breakers bring to the county, residents called for the county to institute a spring break curfew and be more visible and proactive in addressing lawbreaking, particularly underage drinking. Last year, Walton County Commissioner Tony Anderson, whose district includes most of the countys 26 miles of public and private beaches, asked for consideration of a Spring Break curfew  TOP OPINION  Stan Lockhart Before any ban, Florida should first look at Utahs successful ranked choice voting78 via Florida Politics  Ranked choice voting RCV has a long history in Utah for state and county Republican Party elections going back to 2002. Starting in 2019, Utah cities have had the option to use RCV for their nonpartisan elections. RCV is a faster, cheaper, and better way to run our local elections in Utah. Traditionally, Utahs local elections include a Preliminary Election in August to narrow down the field, and then a General Election in November between the top candidates. With RCV, cities can replace two elections with one  shortening the campaign season and reducing the cost to taxpayers. Instead of going to the polls twice which data shows greatly reduces turnout, voters only have to go once!  OPINIONS  RNC should take a lesson from Pence79 via National Review editorial board  There is no conceivable political benefit to the Republican Party or its members, other than Trump, in looking to defend or minimize Jan. 6 rather than simply move on. The American people are never itching to hear a defense of rioters. But the voters have also shown little interest in the Democrats obsession over the event. Republicans who did nothing to encourage the mob, and there are many such Republicans, need not wear a hair shirt over Jan. 6, but when they choose to talk about it, they should tell the unsparing truth. We commend the example of Pence. Pence gives bombshell speech that Trump was wrong. But now comes the hard part80 via the Miami Herald editorial board  Pence finally, finally, finally said what needed to be said. President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election. Well, hallelujah. Its a year late, and its not under oath. But he said it, and to a Florida gathering of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group. If Pence truly wants to remedy any of the damage to this country, he should now encourage other Republicans to drop the masks of falsity so many have willingly worn for a year, too fearful of Trump to stop mouthing his Big Lie. For Pence, it might turn out that his speech was the easy part. But today, in this one moment, hearing a top Republican say the plain and simple truth gives us a flicker of relief, a momentary cessation of pain, like a national headache that suddenly stops hurting. Will Floridas election police be afraid of ghosts? Lawmakers, dump this idea81 via the Miami Herald editorial board  The Frank Artiles ghost candidate scandal has called into question the results of one Miami Senate race and maybe two others, one in Miami and another in Seminole County, all won by Republicans. Its turning into one of the worst abuses of our election system in recent times. That has us thinking Maybe we were too hasty when we said DeSantis proposed election security office was a waste of time and tax money. Surely this kind of potential misconduct would be its reason for existing. Nope. Sen. Travis Hutson, sponsor of the Senate bill that would create an election security office, said this week that the special investigative unit that DeSantis has called for would only deal with election fraud  not candidacy fraud, according to the Orlando Sentinel. If Democrats dont ask questions, nobody will82 via Steve Bousquet of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel  The Senate Ethics and Elections Committee discussed a controversial and hasty 45-page rewrite of a bill that includes a scaled-back version of DeSantis new elections police force Senate Bill 524. Thats Tallahassee-speak for stopping debate and calling for a vote so the minority Democrats cant run out the clock by asking questions. None of the five Republicans asked probing questions. Senators need to keep asking questions about those elections cops, and the potential for partisan witch hunts, and every other proposed change to voting laws. But they learned Friday they will have one less chance to do so. Fewer hearings mean fewer questions, and SB 524 was rerouted by the Senate Presidents office to one fewer committee. Legislation poses a real risk to our states children83 via Dr. Deborah Day for the Tallahassee Democrat  There is an existential threat to children in legislation currently being considered by the Florida House. If passed, House Bill 1395 would codify a presumption of 5050 timesharing between divorced parents. While this may sound fair and reasonable on its face, it is not it poses a real risk to our states children and, I believe, it must be stopped. As a regularly appointed social investigator in family law cases, I work almost exclusively with families going through a divorce and are in conflict over the timesharing of their children. So, it is with this extensive firsthand experience that I speak out against this presumption of the 5050 timesharing provision in HB 1395. Bob Lotane Randy Fines Dirty Dozen, GOP discomfort and hypocrisy84 via Florida Politics  Fine hammered the 12 school districts that defied DeSantis ban on mask mandates  pushing budget language to strip 200M from the Dirty Dozen and redistribute it to districts that complied. Leon Schools Superintendent Hanna called Fine a childish, immature bully. Political observers might be tempted to add another adjective Hypocrite. Fine introduced legislation to require the teaching and other remembrances of the 1920 Ocoee Election Day Riots and the Holocaust. It passed in March 2020, and DeSantis happily signed it. Fast-forward one year, and there was Fine accusing Brevard Schools of using critical race theory CRT. What changed? How did these two go from passing and signing legislation assailing racism and antisemitism to become cheerleaders for a movement aimed at sanitizing Americas shameful racial history? One bills answer to corruption More secrecy85 via the Orlando Sentinel editorial board  There is one bill thats more dangerous than any pro-secrecy legislation weve seen in a long time. If it passes, HB 1547SB 1848 could tunnel new and secretive channels in Floridas already corrupt campaign finance system by hiding the names of big-money donors. Well, if these bills pass, lawmakers will have done something They will have made the situation much, much worse, by wrapping a cloak of secrecy around the names and other identifying information of those big-money donors. Holier-than-thou book banners in Florida ought to start with the Bible86 via Frank Cerabino of The Palm Beach Post  We may have to ban the Bible from Floridas public schools. Book banning is starting to take off in Florida, and as long as it is, we shouldnt leave the Bible out of the discussion. A national group called The County Citizens Defending Freedom has formed in Polk County to remove books from public school libraries deemed harmful to children under the age of 18. OK, so if we need to scrub the public library shelves from books that promote the socialist mentality andor contain narrative accounts of sexual excitement or sexual conduct, its time to round up all the Bibles and lock them away from the children. For starters, Jesus was basically Bernie Sanders in open-toed sandals. If youre into more graphic sexual passages, the Old Testament has a lot to offer.

Seven in 10 survey respondents disapprove of allowing China to host these Olympics, but half plan to tune in anyhow. Just 7 say theyre more enthusiastic about this years games than the 2018 games in South Korea, while 47 say theyre less enthusiastic. Fewer than half of Americans say the Olympics should go ahead while the omicron variant is spreading, while the rest say The Games should be postponed 34 or canceled 16.

Ostensibly, Knight was a professional hockey player, but that didnt pay a livable wage, so she also taught skating lessons. While training with Team USA as it readies to defend its gold medal win over Canada four years ago in Pyeongchang, Knight has continued her work with the Professional Womens Hockey Players Association, which was formed to promote a viable professional league in North America. The organization has offered around 200 of the worlds top players an alternative to the Premier Hockey Federation, the continents only professional womens league, which Knight and her teammates have said is not sustainable.

Mikaela Shiffrins Olympic prep has included covid, isolation, tears  and relief91 via Barry Svrluga of The Washington Post  The Olympics were only five weeks away, and the most prominent Team USA athlete was sequestered in a hotel room in Austria, reduced to doing pullups on her bed frame and lunges with a single 15-kilogram plate. This is not how a two-time gold medalist is supposed to prepare for winning more gold medals. But COVID-19 doesnt care if the Olympics are afoot, so here was Shiffrin, coughing and with a sore throat, in isolation when she should have been ski racing. With the Opening Ceremonies of the Beijing Winter Games on Friday, Shiffrin is over COVID-19, out of isolation and back on the mountain. She has even won again on the World Cup circuit in circumstances that brought about an unprecedented outpouring of emotion, which well get to.

Meet The Maskalorian.92 via Hannah Sampson of The Washington Post  Even in these strange times, the sight is unusual enough to turn heads a helmeted figure in a jumpsuit and cape with a tiny green creature strapped to his chest. Both appear to come from a galaxy far, far away. Both wear disposable masks over their mouths. Masks, it turns out, are the entire point of their mission. Inspired by the hit Star Wars show The Mandalorian on Disney, the character is the brainchild of Matt Adams, a 43-year-old filmmaker and improv performer.

The lovable, round-tailed marine mammals had their worst die-off last year, more than 1,100 of them, and there are federal and state efforts ongoing to save the threatened creatures. One of these efforts is to have a place like SeaWorld, with the marine assets it has, provide rehabilitation to those that can be rescued. SeaWorld announced Friday that it had added five 40-foot 12-meter pools to accommodate up to 20 manatees within two weeks. The theme park is one of five facilities in the U.S. taking care of sick and injured manatees. It had 28 manatees in its care as of Friday.

scranton,Cash blitz: Who's spending the most to influence your vote for California 's Legislature?,2020-10-27T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,"Oil and gasImage via iStock Who they areAs major employers in California with a unionized workforce and huge budgets to spend on campaigns and lobbying, oil companies such as Chevron, Valero and Phillips, as well as gas and electric utilities like PGamp38E and Sempra, have a lot of clout in the statehouse. But as the Capitols dominant Democrats push to combat climate change, oil, gas and other energy companies also face headwinds.Where theyre spendingThe industry is spending big to help Republicans hold on to three SoCal swing seats in the state Senate and to boost a moderate Democrat battling a progressive-backed Democrat for a Stockton-area Assembly seat.Its poured more than 2.5 million into helping re-elect GOP Sen. Ling Ling Chang3 of Diamond Bar and more than 920,000 to re-elect GOP Sen. Scott Wilk4 of Santa Clarita  both of whom face stiff challenges from Democrats hoping to win these purple districts. Oil and gas interests and utilities have also spent more than 1.1 million to help Republican Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh, a Realtor who sits on the Yucaipa school board, who is running5 for an open Senate seat representing the San Bernardino Valley area against Democrat Abigail Medina.The Democrat benefiting most from the oil industry is Carlos Villapudua, a former San Joaquin County supervisor running against6 Democrat Kathy Miller, who has been endorsed by the California League of Conservation Voters. Oil and gas interests have spent 1.3 million to help Villapudua, who has aligned himself with the Assemblys moderate Democrats. Most of the spending  about 55  has gone toward attacking Miller.What they wantWhen Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an order recently banning the sale of gas-powered cars7 in California by 2035  and asked the Legislature to send him a bill outlawing the oil extraction method known as fracking  the industrys priorities for 2021 snapped into focus.Bans are not the way to solve problems, said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association. We would not support a ban on any form of crude oil production in Californiabecause it means more imports of foreign oil.In addition to fighting legislation8 that would outlaw hydraulic fracturing, the oil industry will almost certainly9 try to block efforts to expand the use of electric cars. Reheis-Boyd is calling attention to electric car batteries, many of the minerals for which are mined in Africa and China where, she said, they still use child labor. Environmentalists counter that oil production in foreign countries also can involve human rights abuses.Oil lobbyists convinced lawmakers to kill legislation10 this year that would have required a buffer zone between oil wells and locations where children gather, such as schools and playgrounds. Sierra Club lobbyist Kathryn Phillips said environmentalists are preparing for another round.There is going to be a bill again on trying to get setbacks from oil wells, she said. And oil will be fighting that. Prison guardsPhoto by Penni Gladstone for CalMatters Who they areThe California Correctional Peace Officers Association was once a gale force to be reckoned with in state politics. At the height of Californias three-strikes-and-youre-out crime crackdown, Democrats and Republicans alike feared getting on the wrong side of the guards.The Great Recession, court orders to reduce the state prison populations, and a series of successful ballot measures to relax sentences all pushed the guards into a more defensive posture over the last decade. The union tamped down its spending and its fiery rhetoric and refocused on bread-and butter-issues  maintaining pay and improving working conditions.Now its 2020 and the guards of old is trying to make a comeback. Under the new leadership of Glen Stailey, the union is once again gunning to become the 800-pound gorilla11 of California elections. Where theyre spendingThe guards have spent nearly 4 million this year with the bulk of that money pouring into two races.In Orange County, Republican John Moorlach has served as the Senates most outspoken fiscal hawk. The union has spent nearly 1.4 million in the race  attacking Moorlach as a Trump loyalist and anti-Science or boosting his opponent, Democrat Dave Min, a law professor at UC Irvine.The group has also spent more than 960,000 attacking12 Democratic Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer  including one ad that placed a bullseye13 over the Black politicians face  and supporting his Democratic opponent, Efren Martinez, the former head of the Walnut Park Chamber of Commerce.What they want Keep tabs on the latest California policy and politics news Processing Success!

In September, Newsom announced plans14 to close a prison in Tracy within a year. Hes said hed like to close at least one more15 before 2024. And starting next summer, the state will begin phasing out16 its juvenile prison system entirely, shifting that responsibility down to the counties.Daniel Macallair, director of Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice and a critic of the unions political activities, said he isnt surprised the guards are spending big this year.Whatever keeps the prisons filled are things that they support, he said. With the current economic downturn and COVID-19 and all the pressures brought about from that, if the governor starts talking about closing prisons, that is kicking them into gear.The guards wrath has been bipartisan, aimed at both conservative budget hawks and liberal criminal justice reformers.Stailey, the guard unions president, did not respond to an interview request. But given Sen. Moorlachs fiscal rectitude  he was one of four senators to vote against a 3 pay raise for the guards last year  its no surprise the guards would rather the Orange County senator retire this November.Maybe they want to make an example of me, Moorlach said. Jones-Sawyer, the unions other top target, is no fiscal conservative. Hes a Bernie Sanders-endorsed progressive. Hes also backed tougher oversight of law enforcement officers17, including prison guards, and less strict sentencing18. As chair of the Assembly public safety committee, criminal justice bills generally do not become law without his blessing. Facing a surprisingly strong challenger in Martinez, the prison guards have rushed in to unseat him. TeachersImage via iStock Who they areTogether, the California Teachers Association, the California Federation of Teachers and the California Faculty Association represent more than 450,000 public K-12 teachers and university professors. Both in membership and financial pull, the Teachers Association is the dominant force, a political behemoth with strong ties to the Capitols Democratic leaders.Where theyre spendingUnlike most interest groups that target heavy spending on a handful of legislative races, the teachers political operations spread cash around. Theyve spent more than 2 million cutting checks ranging from 10,000 to 40,000 to help dozens of incumbent Democrats running for re-election in noncompetitive races.Teachers have also spent more than 695,000 trying to influence which Democrat voters send to Sacramento in a pair of expensive same-party contests. Teachers, like many labor unions, are backing Dave Cortese, a Santa Clara County supervisor and former mayoral candidate, in the race against attorney and campaign finance regulator Ann Ravel for a Silicon Valley seat in the state Senate19. Through a joint committee with other organized labor groups, theyre helping incumbent Jones-Sawyer over fellow Democrat20 Martinez in the Los Angeles area race.In similar joint ventures, the unions spent a combined 482,000 trying to flip two Orange County-based Senate seats from the GOP to Democrats. Theyre helping Democrats Dave Min21, a UC Irvine law professor, and Josh Newman22, a former state senator who was recalled from his seat in 2018. Those two are trying to replace, respectively, Republican state Sens.Moorlach and Chang.What they wantTeachers perennially lobby for more funding for public education, but the push is likely to be particularly intense next year. The coronavirus pandemic has hammered government finances23 and upended the daily routines of millions of California students whose campuses have been shuddered since spring.We cant open schools until its safe to do so, and right now its not safe, said Claudia Briggs, a spokesperson for the California Teachers Association. We dont have ventilation, we dont have testing and tracing.All that, of course, costs money.Education groups may also tussle next year over how to teach reading. For two years, teachers have pushed a bill to eliminate a test requirement for new teachers24 to demonstrate they can teach phonics. The bill died amid objections from advocates who said removing the requirement would put kids at risk of landing in a classroom with a teacher who cant help them learn to read. But even advocates who opposed that bill acknowledge that too many teachers dont have sufficient skills to teach reading, which contributes to students poor performance for many years to come. They say theres not enough oversight of teacher training.We indeed have a structural problem that is sending novice teachers into classrooms ill-prepared to teach early reading to California children, Bill Lucia, president of the EdVoice advocacy group, said by email. EdVoice also has a campaign committee, which has spent nearly 122,000 this year to support Martinez. RealtorsImage via iStock Who they areThe friendly folks who help Californians buy and sell their homes are also one of the most influential lobbying groups and campaign rainmakers in the state. Any policy debate that touches housing  how and where homes get built, how much landlords can charge for rent and how easy it is to buy and sell old homes25  interests the Realtors.Where theyre spendingAll over the place. The Realtors not only make their financial presence felt through their own committees, but they frequently pool their campaign cash with other well-monied interests. All together, roughly 2.3 million in Realtor cash has shown up in California legislative races.Nearly 700,000 of that has been spent in two Bay Area Dem-on-Dem races.Realtor cash is backing Cortese over fellow Democrat Ravel, teaming up with other powerful interest groups like the building industry, organized labor and the dentist lobby. Up the Peninsula, the Realtors have unleashed their own committee in support of San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener, who hopes to fend off a challenge from Democratic Socialist Jackie Fielder.The Realtors are also backing incumbents in competitive races across the state more than 300,000 in support of Republican Sen. Chang over Democrat Newman and more than 100,000 a piece supporting Assemblymembers Steven Choi, a Republican, against Democratic challenger and Irvine City Councilmember Melissa Fox Jones-Sawyer moderate Republican Jordan Cunningham of San Luis Obispo, who is being challenged by Morro Bay City Councilmember Dawn Addis and Republican-turned-independent Chad Mayes of Yucca Valley in his race against Republican San Jacinto mayor Andrew Kotyuk.What they wantThe 2020 legislative session was the year that wasnt for California housing policy. The Realtors want a mulligan.In his State of the State speech26 in January, Newsom vowed to put homelessness and housing at the top of our agenda and urged legislators to say yes to housing.Then the coronavirus intervened, curtailing the legislative session, gutting the states spending power and scaling back everyones legislative ambitions. Even relatively modest housing supply boosters, such as a Realtor-backed bill that would have allowed property owners to build duplexes in neighborhoods zoned for single-family homes, failed to make it to the governors desk27.The targeted support of the two Bay Area candidates Sen. Wiener in San Francisco, one of the states preeminent voices for more housing production, and Cortese in San Jose, a former housing developer and real estate investor  is an investment in more supply-related legislation.A loss by Wiener would send a real chilling effect on housing, said Dan Dunmoyer, CEO of the California Building Industry Association, a financial ally of the Realtors in both races. Likewise, a Cortese win would add to the pro-production bloc in the Senate. If you have to walk into a legislators office and explain how to build housing, thats very different than if they can explain it to you.But the Realtors also want to maintain good relationships with incumbents and ensure a bulwark against new rent control measures28 and eviction moratoria29.That may explain the whiplash-inducing about-face the organization pulled in Antelope Valley this year. During the primary, the Realtors supported former Democratic Assemblymember Steve Fox, who is hoping to unseat incumbent Republican Tom Lackey. That spending helped Fox secure his place on the general election ballot. Many irate Democrats30 speculated at the time that this was a play to propel Fox, whom they saw as the weaker Democratic candidate during the primary, into a face-off with Lackey.Sure enough, now that its Lackey versus Fox on the general election ballot, a group called the California Alliance for Progress and Education has spent more than 77,000 against Fox. Realtor groups have contributed at least 44 of that committees cash. The California Association of Realtors did not respond to a request for comment. Other big spendersIllustration via iStock Health Care Industry GroupsAltogether, hospitals, dialysis clinics, doctors, dentists and psychiatric technicians have spent nearly 3 million in independent expenditure hoping to influence this years competitive legislative races. But the health care industry contains multitudes and not all of these interest groups are on the same political page.Dentists make up one of the largest sources of health care industry cash. A committee sponsored by the California Dental Association has spent half a million dollars to prop up some of the Assemblys most vulnerable center-right members Republican Phillip Chen in Diamond Bar, Republican Jordan Cunningham in San Luis Obispo and Chad Mayes of Yucca Valley31, who defected from GOP and is now an independent.But the biggest single beneficiary of health care industry independent spending has been Martinez over Jones-Sawyer in the Los Angeles area Assembly race. And his benefactors have been some strange allies.Since the primary, kidney dialysis company DaVita  the largest funder of opposition to Proposition 2332  has forked over 249,000 to a pro-Martinez committee. That investment was pooled with a slightly larger contribution from the Peace Officers Research Association of California. The committee, the Coalition for Safe Communities thus noted major funding from Peace Officers Research Association of California in its title with no mention of the dialysis corporation.Likewise, the trade group representing the pharmaceutical industry spent another 49,500 on a pro-Martinez committee co-funded with the pro-charter organization EdVoice. EdVoice kicked in 50,000 and its name was listed on the committee name.Other UnionsEven if you separate out the teachers, the nurses, the building trades, the prison guards and the cops, the organized labor groups that remain are still some of the most prolific election spenders.Think the Service Employees International Union, the United Food and Commercial Workers, the United Domestic Workers, the Teamsters and the firefighters. These are all influential groups with a lot of money to spend. This year, all of that money has gone to support Democrats.Cortese in San Jose has been the biggest beneficiary. Most of that support has come from the labor-run Opportunity PAC, one of the largest independent expenditure committees in the state, second only to the oil and gas industrys committee. Though Cortese and his opponent Ravel are both Democrats, Cortese cemented his ties to organized labor when he ran for mayor in 2014 championing his opposition33 to the citys pension cost cutting plan.TechIn the heart of Silicon Valley, Uber and Lyft have opted to spend lavishly on their home turf.So far this year a business-affiliated committee, the Silicon Valley Jobs PAC, has spent more than 2.5 million to boost Ravel over Cortese. Three-fourths of that committees contributions this year come from the two ride hailing companies. That works out to about 1.9 million in support of Ravel  or nearly 90 of all the independent expenditures the tech sector has piped into Californias legislative races this year. No surprise Ravel supports Proposition 2234, the ballot measure sponsored by Uber and Lyft to exempt its drivers from California labor law. Cortese opposes the measure. In addition to the high-stakes Trump vs. Biden presidential match, the 2020 ballot asks you whether to raise property taxes, expand rent control, ban cash bail, further protect consumer data privacy and resurrect affirmative action. It also will determine if the state Legislature remains in the control of a gigamajority of Democrats, and if the blue wave that swept away half of GOP-held congressional seats has receded.

End-Stage Renal Disease ESRD Prospective Payment System PPS On January 1, 2011, we implemented the End-Stage Renal Disease ESRD Prospective Payment System PPS, a case-mix adjusted, bundled PPS for renal dialysis services furnished by ESRD facilities as required by section 1881b14 of the Social Security Act the Act, as added by section 153b of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 MIPPA Pub. L. 110-275. Section 1881b14F of the Act, as added by section 153b of MIPPA, and amended by section 3401h of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act the Affordable Care Act Pub. L. 111-148, established that beginning calendar year CY 2012, and each subsequent year, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services the Secretary shall annually increase payment amounts by an ESRD market basket increase factor, reduced by the productivity adjustment described in section 1886b3BxiII of the Act. This rule updates the ESRD PPS for CY 2022.Page 618752. Coverage and Payment for Renal Dialysis Services Furnished to Individuals With Acute Kidney Injury AKI On June 29, 2015, the President signed the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 TPEA Pub. L. 114-27. Section 808a of the TPEA amended section 1861s2F of the Act to provide coverage for renal dialysis services furnished on or after January 1, 2017, by a renal dialysis facility or a provider of services paid under section 1881b14 of the Act to an individual with acute kidney injury AKI. Section 808b of the TPEA amended section 1834 of the Act by adding a new subsection r that provides for payment for renal dialysis services furnished by renal dialysis facilities or providers of services paid under section 1881b14 of the Act to individuals with AKI at the ESRD PPS base rate beginning January 1, 2017. This rule updates the AKI payment rate for CY 2022.3. End-Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Program ESRD QIP The End-Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Program ESRD QIP is authorized by section 1881h of the Act. The Program fosters improved patient outcomes by establishing incentives for dialysis facilities to meet or exceed performance standards established by the Centers for Medicare amp Medicaid Services CMS. This rule finalizes our proposals to suppress the use of certain ESRD QIP measure data for scoring and payment adjustment purposes in the PY 2022 ESRD QIP because we have determined that circumstances caused by the Public Health Emergency PHE for the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic have significantly affected the validity and reliability of the measures and resulting performance scores, as well as special scoring and payment policies for PY 2022. We are also finalizing our proposal to update the specifications for the SHR clinical measure beginning with the PY 2024 ESRD QIP. We are also finalizing our proposal to use CY 2019 data to calculate the PY 2024 ESRD QIP performance standards. This final rule further describes policies that will apply for PY 2025. Finally, this final rule describes several requests for information that also appeared in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule. These requests for information solicited stakeholder feedback on several important topics, including strategies that we can use to address the gap in existing health inequities, the addition of COVID-19 vaccination measures in future rulemaking, and the use of digital quality measurement.4. End-Stage Renal Disease Treatment Choices ETC Model This rule finalizes changes to the End-Stage Renal Disease ESRD Treatment Choices Model ETC Model, a mandatory Medicare payment model tested under the authority of section 1115A of the Act. The ETC Model is operated by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Innovation Center, and tests the use of payment adjustments to encourage greater utilization of home dialysis and kidney transplants, in order to preserve or enhance the quality of care furnished to Medicare beneficiaries while reducing Medicare expenditures. The ETC Model includes ESRD facilities and certain clinicians caring for beneficiaries with ESRD--or Managing Clinicians--located in Selected Geographic Areas as participants. The ETC Model was finalized as part of a final rule published in the Federal Register on September 29, 2020, titled, Medicare Program Specialty Care Models to Improve Quality of Care and Reduce Expenditures 85 FR 61114, referred to herein as the Specialty Care Models final rule. The ETC Model is designed to test the effectiveness of adjusting certain Medicare payments to ETC Participants ESRD facilities and Managing Clinicians--clinicians who furnish and bill the Monthly Capitation Payment MCP for managing ESRD Beneficiaries--who have been selected to participate in the ETC Model to encourage greater utilization of home dialysis and kidney transplantation, support beneficiary modality choice, reduce Medicare expenditures, and preserve or enhance the quality of care. In the Specialty Care Models final rule, we established that the ETC Model adjusts payments for home dialysis and home dialysis-related claims with claim service dates from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023 through the Home Dialysis Payment Adjustment HDPA. We are assessing the rates of home dialysis and of kidney transplant waitlisting and living donor transplantation, among beneficiaries attributed to ETC Participants during the period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2026. Based on those rates, we are applying the Performance Payment Adjustment PPA to claims for dialysis and dialysis-related services with claim service dates beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2027. We codified these provisions in a new subpart of the Code of Federal Regulations CFR 42 CFR part 512, subpart C. This final rule includes modifications to the ETC Model, including changes to the home dialysis rate and transplant rate, the PPA achievement benchmarking methodology, and the PPA improvement benchmarking and scoring methodology. We are also adding processes and requirements for ETC Participants to receive certain data from CMS and including certain additional waivers and flexibilities as part of the ETC Model test.B. Summary of the Major Provisions1. ESRD PPS Update to the ESRD PPS base rate for CY 2022 The final CY 2022 ESRD PPS base rate is 257.90 This amount reflects the application of the wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor 0.99985 and a productivity-adjusted market basket increase of 1.9 percent as required by section 1881b14FiI of the Act, equaling 257.90 253.13 x 0.99985 x 1.019  257.90. Annual update to the wage index We adjust wage indices on an annual basis using the most current hospital wage data and the latest core-based statistical area CBSA delineations to account for differing wage levels in areas in which ESRD facilities are located. For CY 2022, we are updating the wage index values based on the latest available data and continuing the 2-year transition to the Office of Management and Budget OMB delineations as described in the September 14, 2018 OMB Bulletin No. 18-04. Update to the outlier policy We are updating the outlier policy using the most current data, as well as updating the outlier services fixed-dollar loss FDL amounts for adult and pediatric patients and Medicare allowable payment MAP amounts for adult and pediatric patients for CY 2022 using CY 2020 claims data. Based on the use of the latest available data, the final FDL amount for pediatric beneficiaries will decrease from 44.78 to 26.02, and the MAP amount will decrease from 30.88 to 27.15, as compared to CY 2021 values. For adult beneficiaries, the final FDL amount will decrease from 122.49 to 75.39, and the MAP amount will decrease from 50.92 to 42.75 The 1.0 percent target for outlier payments was not achieved in CY 2020. Outlier payments represented approximately 0.6 percent of total payments rather than 1.0 percent. Update to the offset amount for the transitional add-on payment adjustment for new and innovative equipment and supplies TPNIES for CY 2022 ThePage 61876final CY 2022 average per treatment offset amount for the transitional add-on payment adjustment for new and innovative equipment and supplies TPNIES for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines is 9.50 This offset amount reflects the application of the productivity-adjusted market basket increase of 1.9 percent 9.32 x 1.019  9.50. TPNIES applications received for CY 2022 In this final rule, we announce our determination on the one TPNIES application under consideration for the TPNIES for CY 2022 payment.2. Payment for Renal Dialysis Services Furnished to Individuals With AKI We are updating the AKI payment rate for CY 2022. The final CY 2022 payment rate is 257.90, which is the same as the base rate finalized under the ESRD PPS for CY 2022.3. ESRD QIP We are adopting a measure suppression policy for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE that enables us to suppress the use of one or more measures in the ESRD QIP for scoring and payment adjustment purposes if we determine that circumstances caused by the COVID-19 PHE have significantly affected the measures and resulting performance scores. We are also finalizing our proposal to suppress the Standardized Hospitalization Ratio SHR clinical measure, the Standardized Readmission Ratio SRR clinical measure, the In-Center Hemodialysis Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems ICH CAHPS clinical measure, and the Long-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure for PY 2022 under the measure suppression policy. We are also finalizing our proposal to not score or reduce payment to any facility in PY 2022. We are finalizing our proposal to update the specifications for the SHR clinical measure beginning with the PY 2024 ESRD QIP. We are also finalizing our proposal for the PY 2024 ESRD QIP to use CY 2019 data to calculate the performance standards for that payment year. This final rule also announces the performance standards and estimated payment reductions that will apply for PY 2024. This final rule describes several policies continuing for PY 2025, but does not include any new requirements beginning with the PY 2025 ESRD QIP. This final rule includes public comments received in response to requests for information that appeared in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule. In those requests for information, we solicited stakeholder feedback on several important topics, including closing the gap in health equity, adding a COVID-19 vaccination measure for health care personnel HCP to the ESRD QIP measure set in future rulemaking, adding a COVID-19 vaccination measure for ESRD patients to the ESRD QIP measure set in future rulemaking, and potential actions and priority areas that would enable us to continue moving toward a greater digital capture of data and use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources FHIRsupreg standard in quality measurement.4. ETC Model We are implementing the following changes to the ETC Model beginning for the third Measurement Year MY3 of the Model, which begins January 1, 2022. Beneficiary Attribution for Living Kidney Donor Transplants To better reflect the care relationship between beneficiaries who receive pre-emptive living donor transplants LDT and the Managing Clinicians who provide their care, we are modifying the methodology for attributing Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries to Managing Clinicians, such that a Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary will be attributed to the Managing Clinician who submitted the most claims for services furnished to the beneficiary during the 365 days prior to the transplant date. Home Dialysis Rate Calculation To incentivize additional alternative renal replacement modalities under the ETC Model, we are adding nocturnal in-center dialysis to the calculation of the home dialysis rate for ESRD facilities and Managing Clinicians. Transplant Rate Beneficiary Exclusion To better align with common reasons transplant centers do not place patients on the transplant waitlist, we are excluding beneficiaries with a diagnosis of, and who are receiving treatment with chemotherapy or radiation for, vital solid organ cancers from the calculation of the transplant rate. Performance Payment Adjustment Achievement Benchmarking Methodology When we originally finalized the ETC Model, we stated our intent to increase achievement benchmarks above rates observed in Comparison Geographic Areas for future model years. As such, we will increase achievement benchmarks by 10 percent over rates observed in Comparison Geographic Areas every two MYs, beginning in MY3 2022. We also will stratify achievement benchmarks based on the proportion of attributed beneficiaries who are dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid or receive the Low Income Subsidy LIS during the MY, in recognition that beneficiaries with lower socioeconomic status have lower rates of home dialysis and transplant than those with higher socioeconomic status. Performance Payment Adjustment Improvement Benchmarking and Scoring In conjunction with the stratification of the achievement benchmarks based on the proportion of beneficiaries who are dual-eligible or LIS recipients, we will introduce the Health Equity Incentive to the improvement scoring methodology used in calculating the PPA. CMS expects that the Health Equity Incentive will encourage ETC Participants to decrease disparities in renal replacement modality choice among beneficiaries with lower socioeconomic status by rewarding ETC Participants that demonstrate significant improvement in the home dialysis rate or transplant rate among their attributed beneficiaries who are dual-eligible or LIS recipients. We also will adjust the improvement scoring calculation to avoid the scenario where an ETC Participant cannot receive an improvement score because its home dialysis rate or transplant rate was zero during the Benchmark Year. Performance Payment Adjustment Reports and Related Data Sharing To ensure that ETC Participants have timely access to ETC Model reports, we are establishing a process under which CMS will share certain model data with ETC Participants. Medicare Waivers We are including an additional programmatic waiver to provide Managing Clinicians who are ETC Participants additional flexibility in furnishing the kidney disease patient education services described in Sec. 410.48, namely a waiver of certain telehealth requirements as necessary solely for purposes of allowing ETC Participants to furnish kidney disease patient education services via telehealth under the ETC Model to take effect at the end of the COVID-19 PHE. Kidney Disease Patient Education Services Coinsurance Waivers We will permit Managing Clinicians who are ETC Participants to reduce or waive the beneficiary coinsurance for kidney disease patient education services, subject to certain requirements. We have made the determination that the anti-kickback statute safe harbor for CMS-sponsored model patient incentives 42 CFR 1001.952ii2, will be available to protect the reduction or elimination of coinsurance that is made in compliance with our policy.Page 61877C. Summary of Costs and Benefits In section VIII.C.5 of this final rule, we set forth a detailed analysis of the impacts that the changes will have on affected entities and beneficiaries. The impacts include the following1. Impacts of the Final ESRD PPS The impact table in section VIII.C.5.a of this final rule displays the estimated change in payments to ESRD facilities in CY 2022 compared to estimated payments in CY 2021. The overall impact of the CY 2022 changes is projected to be a 2.5 percent increase in payments. Hospital-based ESRD facilities have an estimated 3.3 percent increase in payments compared with freestanding facilities with an estimated 2.5 percent increase. We estimate that the aggregate ESRD PPS expenditures will increase by approximately 290 million in CY 2022 compared to CY 2021. This reflects a 220 million increase from the payment rate update, a 70 million increase due to the updates to the outlier threshold amounts, and approximately 2.5 million in estimated TPNIES payment amounts, as further described in the next paragraph. Because of the projected 2.5 percent overall payment increase, we estimate there will be an increase in beneficiary coinsurance payments of 2.5 percent in CY 2022, which translates to approximately 60 million. Section 1881b14Div of the Act provides that the ESRD PPS may include such other payment adjustments as the Secretary determines appropriate. Under this authority, CMS implemented Sec. 413.236 to establish the TPNIES, a transitional add-on payment adjustment for new and innovative equipment and supplies, which is not budget neutral. As discussed in section II.C.1.a of this final rule, we have determined that the Tablosupreg System, a hemodialysis machine that has FDA authorization for home use, has met the criteria for the TPNIES for CY 2022 payment. We estimate that the overall TPNIES payment amounts in CY 2022 would be approximately 2.5 million, of which, approximately 490,000 would be attributed to beneficiary coinsurance amounts.2. Impacts of the Final Payment for Renal Dialysis Services Furnished to Individuals With AKI The impact table in section VIII.C.5.b of this final rule displays the estimated change in payments to ESRD facilities in CY 2022 compared to estimated payments in CY 2021. The overall impact of the CY 2022 changes is projected to be a 1.9 percent increase in payments for individuals with AKI. Hospital-based ESRD facilities have an estimated 2.0 percent increase in payments compared with freestanding ESRD facilities with an estimated 1.9 percent increase. The overall impact reflects the effects of the updated wage index and the final payment rate update. We estimate that the aggregate payments made to ESRD facilities for renal dialysis services furnished to patients with AKI, at the final CY 2022 ESRD PPS base rate, will increase by 1 million in CY 2022 compared to CY 2021.3. Impacts of the ESRD QIP Our finalized policy to suppress measures for the PY 2022 ESRD QIP and to revise the scoring and payment methodology such that no facility will receive a payment reduction necessitated a modification to our previous estimated overall economic impact of the PY 2022 ESRD QIP 84 FR 60651. In the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule, we estimated that the overall economic impact of the PY 2022 ESRD QIP would be approximately 229 million as a result of the policies we had finalized at that time. The 229 million figure for PY 2022 included costs associated with the collection of information requirements, which we estimated would be approximately 211 million, and 18 million in estimated payment reductions across all facilities. However, as a result of the policies we are finalizing in this final rule for the PY 2022 ESRD QIP, we are modifying our previous estimate for PY 2022. We estimate that the new overall economic impact of the PY 2022 ESRD QIP will be approximately 215 million. The 215 million figure for PY 2022 only includes the costs associated with the collection of information requirements because there will be no payment reductions in PY 2022. We estimate that the overall economic impact of the PY 2024 ESRD QIP will be approximately 232 million, of which 215 million is associated with the collection of information requirements and 17 million is associated with the estimated payment reductions across all facilities. We also estimate that the overall economic impact of the PY 2025 ESRD QIP will be approximately 232 million.4. Impacts of Changes to the ETC Model The impact estimate in section VIII.B.4 of this final rule describes the estimated change in anticipated Medicare program savings arising from the ETC Model over the duration of the ETC Model as a result of the changes in this final rule. We estimate that the ETC Model will result in 28 million in net savings over the 6.5-year duration of the ETC Model. We also estimate that 5 million of the estimated 28 million in net savings will be attributable to changes in this final rule.II. Calendar Year CY 2022 End-Stage Renal Disease ESRD Prospective Payment System PPSA. Background1. Statutory Background On January 1, 2011, the Centers for Medicare amp Medicaid Services CMS implemented the End-Stage Renal Disease ESRD Prospective Payment System PPS, a case-mix adjusted bundled PPS for renal dialysis services furnished by ESRD facilities, as required by section 1881b14 of the Social Security Act the Act, as added by section 153b of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 MIPPA. Section 1881b14F of the Act, as added by section 153b of MIPPA and amended by section 3401h of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act the Affordable Care Act, established that beginning with CY 2012, and each subsequent year, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services the Secretary shall annually increase payment amounts by an ESRD market basket increase factor reduced by the productivity adjustment described in section 1886b3BxiII of the Act. Section 632 of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ATRA Pub. L. 112-240 included several provisions that apply to the ESRD PPS. Section 632a of ATRA added section 1881b14I to the Act, which required the Secretary, by comparing per patient utilization data from 2007 with such data from 2012, to reduce the single payment for renal dialysis services furnished on or after January 1, 2014 to reflect the Secretarys estimate of the change in the utilization of ESRD-related drugs and biologicals excluding oral-only ESRD-related drugs. Consistent with this requirement, in the CY 2014 ESRD PPS final rule we finalized 29.93 as the total drug utilization reduction and finalized a policy to implement the amount over a 3- to 4-year transition period 78 FR 72161 through 72170. Section 632b of ATRA prohibited the Secretary from paying for oral-only ESRD-related drugs and biologicals under the ESRD PPS prior to January 1, 2016. Section 632c of ATRA required the Secretary, by no later than January 1, 2016, to analyze the case-mix payment adjustments under section 1881b14Di of the Act and makePage 61878appropriate revisions to those adjustments. On April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 PAMA Pub. L. 113-93 was enacted. Section 217 of PAMA included several provisions that apply to the ESRD PPS. Specifically, sections 217b1 and 2 of PAMA amended sections 1881b14F and I of the Act and replaced the drug utilization adjustment that was finalized in the CY 2014 ESRD PPS final rule 78 FR 72161 through 72170 with specific provisions that dictated the market basket update for CY 2015 0.0 percent and how the market basket should be reduced in CY 2016 through CY 2018. Section 217a1 of PAMA amended section 632b1 of ATRA to provide that the Secretary may not pay for oral-only ESRD-related drugs under the ESRD PPS prior to January 1, 2024. Section 217a2 of PAMA further amended section 632b1 of ATRA by requiring that in establishing payment for oral-only drugs under the ESRD PPS, the Secretary must use data from the most recent year available. Section 217c of PAMA provided that as part of the CY 2016 ESRD PPS rulemaking, the Secretary shall establish a process for 1 determining when a product is no longer an oral-only drug and 2 including new injectable and intravenous products into the ESRD PPS bundled payment. Finally, on December 19, 2014, the President signed the Stephen Beck, Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014 ABLE Pub. L. 113-295. Section 204 of ABLE amended section 632b1 of ATRA, as amended by section 217a1 of PAMA, to provide that payment for oral-only renal dialysis services cannot be made under the ESRD PPS bundled payment prior to January 1, 2025.2. System for Payment of Renal Dialysis Services Under the ESRD PPS, a single per-treatment payment is made to an ESRD facility for all the renal dialysis services defined in section 1881b14B of the Act and furnished to individuals for the treatment of ESRD in the ESRD facility or in a patients home. We have codified our definition of renal dialysis services at Sec. 413.171, which is in 42 CFR part 413, subpart H, along with other ESRD PPS payment policies. The ESRD PPS base rate is adjusted for characteristics of both adult and pediatric patients and accounts for patient case-mix variability. The adult case-mix adjusters include five categories of age, body surface area, low body mass index, onset of dialysis, and four comorbidity categories that is, pericarditis, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, hereditary hemolytic or sickle cell anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome. A different set of case-mix adjusters are applied for the pediatric population. Pediatric patient-level adjusters include two age categories under age 22, or age 22-26 and two dialysis modalities that is, peritoneal or hemodialysis Sec. 413.235a and b. The ESRD PPS provides for three facility-level adjustments. The first payment adjustment accounts for ESRD facilities furnishing a low volume of dialysis treatments Sec. 413.232. The second adjustment reflects differences in area wage levels developed from core-based statistical areas CBSAs Sec. 413.231. The third payment adjustment accounts for ESRD facilities furnishing renal dialysis services in a rural area Sec. 413.233. There are four additional payment adjustments under the ESRD PPS. The ESRD PPS provides adjustments, when applicable, for 1 A training add-on for home and self-dialysis modalities Sec. 413.235c 2 an additional payment for high cost outliers due to unusual variations in the type or amount of medically necessary care Sec. 413.237 3 a transitional drug add-on payment adjustment TDAPA for certain new renal dialysis drugs and biological products Sec. 413.234c and 4 a transitional add-on payment adjustment for new and innovative equipment and supplies TPNIES for certain qualifying, new and innovative renal dialysis equipment and supplies Sec. 413.236d.3. Updates to the ESRD PPS Policy changes to the ESRD PPS are proposed and finalized annually in the Federal Register. The CY 2011 ESRD PPS final rule was published on August 12, 2010 in the Federal Register 75 FR 49030 through 49214. That rule implemented the ESRD PPS beginning on January 1, 2011 in accordance with section 1881b14 of the Act, as added by section 153b of MIPPA, over a 4-year transition period. Since the implementation of the ESRD PPS, we have published annual rules to make routine updates, policy changes, and clarifications. On November 9, 2020, we published a final rule in the Federal Register titled, Medicare Program End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System, Payment for Renal Dialysis Services Furnished to Individuals With Acute Kidney Injury, and End-Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Program, referred to herein as the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule. In that rule, we updated the ESRD PPS base rate, wage index, and outlier policy, for CY 2021. We also finalized an update to the ESRD PPS wage index to adopt the 2018 OMB delineations with a transition period, changes to the eligibility criteria and determination process for the TPNIES, an expansion of the TPNIES to include certain new and innovative capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines, an addition to the ESRD PPS base rate to include calcimimetics in the ESRD PPS bundled payment, and a change to the low-volume payment adjustment eligibility criteria and attestation requirement to account for the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 Public Health Emergency PHE. For further detailed information regarding these updates, see 85 FR 71398.B. Provisions of the Proposed Rule, Public Comments, and Responses to the Comments on the CY 2022 ESRD PPS The proposed rule, titled Medicare Program End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System, Payment for Renal Dialysis Services Furnished to Individuals With Acute Kidney Injury, End-Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Program, and End-Stage Renal Disease Treatment Choices Model 86 FR 36322 through 36437, referred to as the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, was published in the Federal Register on July 9, 2021, with a comment period that ended on August 31, 2021. In that proposed rule, we proposed to make a number of annual updates for CY 2022, including updates to the ESRD PPS base rate, wage index, outlier policy, and the offset amount for TPNIES for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines used in the home. The proposed rule presented a summary of the two CY 2022 TPNIES applications that we received by the February 1, 2021 deadline and our analysis of the applicants claims related to substantial clinical improvement SCI and other eligibility criteria for the TPNIES. We received 286 public comments on our proposals, including comments from kidney and dialysis organizations, such as large and small dialysis organizations, for-profit and non-profit ESRD facilities, ESRD networks, and a dialysis coalition. We also received comments from patients healthcare providers for adult and pediatric ESRD beneficiaries home dialysis services and advocacy organizations provider and legal advocacy organizations administrators and insurance groups a non-profit dialysis association, a professional association, and alliances for kidney care and home dialysis stakeholders drug and device manufacturers health care systems aPage 61879health solutions company and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission MedPAC. In this final rule, we provide a summary of each proposed provision, a summary of the public comments received and our responses to them, and the policies we are finalizing for the CY 2022 ESRD PPS.1. CY 2022 ESRD PPS Updatea. CY 2022 ESRD Bundled ESRDB Market Basket Update, Productivity Adjustment, and Labor-Related Share In accordance with section 1881b14Fi of the Act, as added by section 153b of MIPPA and amended by section 3401h of the Affordable Care Act, beginning in 2012, the ESRD PPS payment amounts are required to be annually increased by an ESRD market basket increase factor and reduced by the productivity adjustment described in section 1886b3BxiII of the Act. The application of the productivity adjustment may result in the increase factor being less than 0.0 percent for a year and may result in payment rates for a year being less than the payment rates for the preceding year. The statute also provides that the market basket increase factor should reflect the changes over time in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services used to furnish renal dialysis services. As required under section 1881b14Fi of the Act, CMS developed an all-inclusive ESRD Bundled ESRDB input price index 75 FR 49151 through 49162. In the CY 2015 ESRD PPS final rule, we rebased and revised the ESRDB input price index to reflect a 2012 base year 79 FR 66129 through 66136. Subsequently, in the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule, we finalized a rebased ESRDB input price index to reflect a 2016 base year 83 FR 56951 through 56962. Although market basket technically describes the mix of goods and services used for ESRD treatment, this term is also commonly used to denote the input price index that is, cost categories, their respective weights, and price proxies combined derived from a market basket. Accordingly, the term ESRDB market basket, as used in this document, refers to the ESRDB input price index. We proposed to use the CY 2016-based ESRDB market basket as finalized and described in the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule 83 FR 56951 through 56962 to compute the CY 2022 ESRDB market basket increase factor based on the best available data. Consistent with historical practice, we proposed to estimate the ESRDB market basket update based on IHS Global Inc.s IGIs forecast using the most recently available data. IGI is a nationally recognized economic and financial forecasting firm with which we contract to forecast the components of the market baskets. Using this methodology and the IGI first quarter 2021 forecast of the CY 2016-based ESRDB market basket with historical data through the fourth quarter of 2020, the proposed CY 2022 ESRDB market basket increase factor was 1.6 percent. Under section 1881b14Fi of the Act, for CY 2012 and each subsequent year, the ESRD market basket percentage increase factor shall be reduced by the productivity adjustment described in section 1886b3BxiII of the Act. The productivity adjustment is calculated using a projection of multifactor productivity MFP, which is derived by subtracting the contribution of labor and capital input growth from output growth. We finalized the detailed methodology for deriving the projection of MFP in the CY 2012 ESRD PPS final rule 76 FR 40503 through 40504. The most up-to-date MFP projection methodology is available on the CMS website at We noted in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule that for CY 2022 and beyond, we are changing the name of this adjustment to refer to it as the productivity adjustment, which is the term used in sections 1881b14Fi and 1886b3BxiII of the Act, rather than the multifactor productivity or MFP adjustment. This is not a change in policy, as we will continue to use the same methodology for deriving the adjustment and rely on the same underlying data. Using this methodology and the IGI first quarter 2021 forecast, the proposed productivity adjustment for CY 2022 the 10-year moving average of MFP for the period ending CY 2022 was 0.6 percent. As a result of these provisions, the proposed CY 2022 ESRD market basket increase factor reduced by the productivity adjustment was 1.0 percent. The proposed market basket increase factor is calculated by starting with the proposed CY 2022 ESRDB market basket percentage increase factor of 1.6 percent and reducing it by the proposed productivity adjustment the 10-year moving average of MFP for the period ending CY 2022 of 0.6 percent. As is our general practice, we proposed that if more recent data became available after the publication of the proposed rule and before the publication of the final rule for example, a more recent estimate of the CY 2016-based ESRD market basket increase factor or productivity adjustment, we would use such data, if appropriate, to determine the final CY 2022 market basket update and productivity adjustment in this final rule 85 FR 36327. We invited public comment on our proposals for the CY 2022 ESRD market basket update and productivity adjustment. The following is a summary of the public comments received on these proposals and our responses. Comment Several commenters encouraged CMS to examine the data sources and other elements to ensure that the market basket update reflects ESRD facilities current experience. The commenters stated that while they understand CMS must follow the statutory framework for the annual market basket update, they believe that the proposed CY 2022 market basket update appears low given inflation and rising expenses including rent and labor. Several commenters expressed that they support the proposed ESRD PPS annual payment rate update for CY 2022 and support the use of more recent data for the market basket update and productivity adjustment, if available, to determine the final update factors for CY 2022. MedPAC commented that while it recognizes that CMS must provide the statutorily mandated payment update of the market basket minus the productivity adjustment, the Commission has concluded that this increase is not warranted based on their analysis of payment adequacy, which includes an assessment of beneficiary access, supply of ESRD facilities, and ESRD facilities access to capital, quality, and financial indicators for the sector. MedPAC further recommended that Congress should eliminate the update to the ESRD PPS base rate for CY 2022. Response We acknowledge the concerns of some of the commenters and appreciate the support of some of the commenters regarding the proposed ESRD PPS annual payment rate update and use of more recent data to determine the market basket and productivity adjustment in determination of the final update factor. We also appreciate MedPACs comments but note that the ESRD market basket increase factor is mandated by statute. For this final rule, we have incorporated more current historical data and revised forecasts provided by IGI that factor in expected price and wage pressures. By incorporating the most recent estimates available of the market basket updatePage 61880and productivity adjustment, we believe these data reflect the best available projection of input price inflation faced by ESRD facilities for CY 2022, adjusted for economy-wide productivity, which is required by statute. As stated previously in this section of the final rule, consistent with our proposal to use more recent data, the CY 2022 ESRD market basket increase factor is 1.9 percent based on the more recent IGI third quarter 2021 forecast. Comment A few commenters noted that while they understand that the productivity adjustment is statutorily required, they believe that the experience of ESRD facilities argues against the idea that productivity can be improved year-over-year. Response We acknowledge the commenters concerns regarding productivity growth at the economy-wide level and its application to ESRD facilities. As the commenter acknowledges, however, section 1881b14Fi of the Act requires the application of the productivity adjustment described in section 1886b3BxiII of the Act to the ESRD PPS market basket increase factor for 2012 and subsequent years. We will continue to monitor the impact of the payment updates, including the effects of the productivity adjustment, on ESRD provider margins as well as beneficiary access to care as reported by MedPAC. Comment One commenter recommended CMS replace the current price proxy for the non-Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents ESA Pharmaceutical cost weight in the 2016-based ESRD market basket Producer Price Index PPI--Commodity--Vitamin, nutrient, and hematinic preparations with BLS PPI Commodity Data for Chemicals and Allied Products-Drugs and Pharmaceuticals, seasonally adjusted BLS Series ID WPS063 Series. The commenter further stated that they do not believe that the current proxy appropriately captures the price of drugs that fall within this category as they are not over-the-counter vitamins but prescription-only, synthesized hormones. The commenter also noted that there are new drugs under development currently that likely will be added to the ESRD PPS bundled payment during the next few years. The commenter asserted that an alternative proxy for the non-ESA drugs should be based on prescription drugs rather than the current proxy. Response We appreciate the commenters suggestion and share the commenters desire to use the most appropriate price proxy for non-ESA drugs in the ESRD market basket. As described in the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule 83 FR 56960 through 56961, and in the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule 85 FR 71428, we believe the PPI for Vitamins, Nutrients, and Hematinic Preparation VNHP is the most appropriate price proxy for non-ESA drugs and analysis of the Average Sales Price ASP data for Non-ESA drugs in the ESRD PPS bundled payment suggests the trends in the PPI VNHP trends are reasonable. We appreciate the commenters concern about the potential shifts in the mix of drugs within the ESRD PPS bundled payment as new drugs enter the market. We will continue to monitor the impact that these changes have on the relative cost share weights and the mix of Non-ESA drugs included in the ESRD PPS bundled payment in the ESRDB market basket, and propose changes if appropriate in future rulemaking. Final Rule Action After considering the public comments, consistent with our historical practice and our proposal, we are estimating the market basket increase and the productivity adjustment based on IGIs forecast using the most recent available data. Based on IGIs third quarter 2021 forecast of the 2016-based ESRDB market basket with historical data through the second quarter of 2021, the 2016-based ESRDB market basket update for CY 2022 is 2.4 percent. IGIs 2021 third quarter forecast reflects a higher CY 2022 inflationary outlook compared to IGIs 2021 first quarter forecast, which is resulting in a notable upward revision to the CY 2022 ESRD market basket update for the CY 2022 ESRD PPS final rule 2.4 percent compared to the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 1.6 percent. As the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic ease, the relatively higher inflation is resulting in relatively higher projected growth in wage, medical materials and supplies, and capital prices. Based on the more recent data available from IGIs third quarter 2021 forecast, the current estimate of the productivity adjustment for CY 2022 the 10-year moving average of MFP for the period ending CY 2021 is 0.5 percentage point. Therefore, the final CY 2022 ESRD market basket adjusted for the productivity adjustment is projected to be 1.9 percent 2.4 percent market basket update reduced by 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. For the CY 2022 ESRD PPS payment update, we proposed to continue using a labor-related share of 52.3 percent for the ESRD PPS payment, which was finalized in the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule 83 FR 56963. We invited public comment on the proposed labor-related share for CY 2022. We did not receive any comments on the proposal to continue using a labor-related share of 52.3 percent for CY 2022 and, therefore, are finalizing the continued use of a 52.3 percent labor-related share as proposed.b. CY 2022 ESRD PPS Wage Indices1 Background Section 1881b14DivII of the Act provides that the ESRD PPS may include a geographic wage index payment adjustment, such as the index referred to in section 1881b12D of the Act, as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. In the CY 2011 ESRD PPS final rule 75 FR 49200, we finalized an adjustment for wages at Sec. 413.231 Specifically, CMS adjusts the labor-related portion of the base rate to account for geographic differences in the area wage levels using an appropriate wage index, which reflects the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs in the geographic area in which the ESRD facility is located. We use OMBs CBSA-based geographic area designations to define urban and rural areas and their corresponding wage index values 75 FR 49117. OMB publishes bulletins regarding CBSA changes, including changes to CBSA numbers and titles. The bulletins are available online at For CY 2022, we proposed to update the wage indices to account for updated wage levels in areas in which ESRD facilities are located using our existing methodology. We use the most recent pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage data collected annually under the inpatient PPS. The ESRD PPS wage index values are calculated without regard to geographic reclassifications authorized under sections 1886d8 and d10 of the Act and utilize prefloor hospital data that are unadjusted for occupational mix. For CY 2022, the updated wage data are for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2017, and before October 1, 2018 fiscal year FY 2018 cost report data. We have also adopted methodologies for calculating wage index values for ESRD facilities that are located in urban and rural areas where there is no hospital data. For a full discussion, see CY 2011 and CY 2012 ESRD PPS final rules at 75 FR 49116 through 49117 and 76 FR 70239 through 70241, respectively. For urban areas with no hospital data, we compute the average wage index value of all urban areas within the State to serve as a reasonablePage 61881proxy for the wage index of that urban CBSA, that is, we use that value as the wage index. For rural areas with no hospital data, we compute the wage index using the average wage index values from all contiguous CBSAs to represent a reasonable proxy for that rural area. We apply the statewide urban average based on the average of all urban areas within the State to Hinesville-Fort Stewart, Georgia 78 FR 72173, and we apply the wage index for Guam to American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands 78 FR 72172. A wage index floor value 0.5000 is applied under the ESRD PPS as a substitute wage index for areas with very low wage index values. Currently, all areas with wage index values that fall below the floor are located in Puerto Rico. However, the wage index floor value is applicable for any area that may fall below the floor. A description of the history of the wage index floor under the ESRD PPS can be found in the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule 83 FR 56964 through 56967. An ESRD facilitys wage index is applied to the labor-related share of the ESRD PPS base rate. In the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule 83 FR 56963, we finalized a labor-related share of 52.3 percent, which is based on the 2016-based ESRDB market basket. In the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule 85 FR 71436, we updated the OMB delineations as described in the September 14, 2018 OMB Bulletin No. 18-04, beginning with the CY 2021 ESRD PPS wage index. In addition, we finalized the application of a 5 percent cap on any decrease in an ESRD facilitys wage index from the ESRD facilitys wage index from the prior CY. We finalized that the transition would be phased in over 2 years, such that the reduction in an ESRD facilitys wage index would be capped at 5 percent in CY 2021, and no cap would be applied to the reduction in the wage index for the second year, CY 2022. Thus, for CY 2022, the labor-related share to which a facilitys wage index would be applied is 52.3 percent. The comments received on the proposed CY 2022 ESRD PPS wage index and our responses to the comments are set forth below. Comment A coalition of dialysis organizations and a professional association acknowledged and supported the final phase-in of the updated OMB delineations for CY 2022. These commenters, along with another large dialysis organization, suggested that CMS consider ways to better tailor the ESRD PPS wage index, including using additional data beyond the hospital wage data. Another small dialysis organization expressed concerns that the ESRD PPS wage index does not keep pace with the hospital wage index, and identified several potential changes to align the ESRD PPS wage index with the hospital wage index, including the application of a statewide rural floor on wage indices, the application of different labor-related share percentages for areas with wage indices above and below 1, and allowing ESRD facilities to reclassify to a different geographic area. Another commenter, a non-profit kidney care alliance, expressed similar concerns and urged CMS to promptly address these disparities between the ESRD PPS wage index and the hospital wage index in rulemaking in the near future. Response We thank the commenters for their support, and we appreciate the suggestions for improving the ESRD PPS wage index. We did not propose changes to the ESRD PPS wage index methodology for CY 2022, and therefore we are not finalizing any changes to that methodology in this final rule. However, we will take these comments into consideration to potentially inform future rulemaking. Comment Three commenters, including a large dialysis organization, a non-profit health insurance organization in Puerto Rico, and a healthcare group in Puerto Rico, commented on the wage index for ESRD facilities located in Puerto Rico. These commenters recommended that CMS increase the wage index floor from 0.5000 to 0.5500 they noted that in the CY 2019 ESRD PPS proposed rule, CMS reported that its own analysis indicated that Puerto Ricos wage index likely lies between 0.5100 and 0.5500 They noted that CMS further stated that any wage index values less than 0.5936 are considered outlier values. They pointed out that CMS still finalized a floor at 0.50 and characterized it as a balance between providing additional payments to affected areas while minimizing the impact on the ESRD PPS base rate. The commenters also recommended that CMS align the ESRD PPS wage index with the hospital wage index by applying to the ESRD PPS wage index the policy finalized in the FY 2020 IPPS final rule 84 FR 42326 through 42328 that increases the wage index for hospitals with a wage index value below the 25th percentile wage index. Two of the commenters further suggested that CMS conduct a survey of registered nurse RN and health worker wages specifically in standalone ESRD facilities in Puerto Rico as a means for wage index reform, noting that there is specific professional scope of practice standards for technicians in Puerto Rico outpatient facilities. Commenters asserted that RNs must provide all ESRD care in Puerto Rico outpatient facilities per local scope of practice laws, and that CMS should evaluate inpatient and outpatient facility data separately in order to get a fully accurate projection of wage costs for ESRD providers in Puerto Rico. Another commenter recommended that CMS evaluate policy inequities between the ESRD PPS wage index for ESRD facilities located in Puerto Rico compared to other states and territories, taking into consideration the unique circumstances that affect Puerto Rico, including its shortage of healthcare specialists and labor work force, remote geography, transportation and freighting costs, drug pricing, and lack of transitional care services. Response We thank the commenters for sharing their concerns regarding the ESRD PPS wage index for ESRD facilities in Puerto Rico and their suggestions for wage index reform. As noted in the CY 2018 ESRD PPS final rule 82 FR 50747 and the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule 83 FR 56964 through 56967, we have received conflicting information from commenters about the local scope of practice for RNs and other staff impact on facility costs in Puerto Rico. Since we did not propose any changes to the wage index floor or wage index methodology for CY 2022, we are not finalizing any changes to those policies in this final rule. However, we appreciate the concerns that commenters have raised and we will take these thoughtful suggestions into account when considering future rulemaking. Final Rule Action We are finalizing the CY 2022 ESRD PPS wage indices based on the latest hospital wage data as proposed. For CY 2022, the labor-related share to which a facilitys wage index is applied is 52.3 percent. As we finalized in the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule 85 FR 71436, there will be no cap applied to the reduction in the ESRD PPS wage index for CY 2022. The final CY 2022 ESRD PPS wage index is set forth in Addendum A and is available on the CMS website at Addendum A provides a crosswalk between the CY 2021 wage index and the CY 2022 wage index. Addendum B provides an ESRD facility level impact analysis. Addendum B is available on the CMS website at 61882Renal-Disease-ESRD-Payment-Regulations-and-Notices.c. CY 2022 Update to the Outlier Policy Section 1881b14Dii of the Act requires that the ESRD PPS include a payment adjustment for high cost outliers due to unusual variations in the type or amount of medically necessary care, including variability in the amount of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ESAs necessary for anemia management. Some examples of the patient conditions that may be reflective of higher facility costs when furnishing dialysis care would be frailty, obesity, and comorbidities, such as secondary hyperparathyroidism. The ESRD PPS recognizes high cost patients, and we have codified the outlier policy and our methodology for calculating outlier payments at Sec. 413.237 The policy provides that the following ESRD outlier items and services are included in the ESRD PPS bundle 1 Renal dialysis drugs and biological products that were or would have been, prior to January 1, 2011, separately billable under Medicare Part B 2 renal dialysis laboratory tests that were or would have been, prior to January 1, 2011, separately billable under Medicare Part B  3 renal dialysis medicalsurgical supplies, including syringes, used to administer renal dialysis drugs and biological products that were or would have been, prior to January 1, 2011, separately billable under Medicare Part B 4 renal dialysis drugs and biological products that were or would have been, prior to January 1, 2011, covered under Medicare Part D, including renal dialysis oral-only drugs effective January 1, 2025 and 5 renal dialysis equipment and supplies, except for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines as defined in Sec. 413.236a2, that receive the transitional add-on payment adjustment as specified in Sec. 413.236 after the payment period has ended. In the CY 2011 ESRD PPS final rule 75 FR 49142, CMS stated that for purposes of determining whether an ESRD facility would be eligible for an outlier payment, it would be necessary for the facility to identify the actual ESRD outlier services furnished to the patient by line item that is, date of service on the monthly claim. Renal dialysis drugs, laboratory tests, and medicalsurgical supplies that are recognized as outlier services were specified in Transmittal 2134, dated January 14, 2011.1 Furthermore, CMS uses administrative issuances to update the renal dialysis service items available for outlier payment via our quarterly update CMS Change Requests, when applicable. For example, we use these updates to identify renal dialysis service drugs that were or would have been covered under Medicare Part D for outlier eligibility purposes and items and services that have been incorrectly identified as eligible outlier services.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Transmittal 2033 issued August 20, 2010, was rescinded and replaced by Transmittal 2094, dated November 17, 2010. Transmittal 2094 identified additional drugs and laboratory tests that may also be eligible for ESRD outlier payment. Transmittal 2094 was rescinded and replaced by Transmittal 2134, dated January 14, 2011, which included one technical correction. Under Sec. 413.237, an ESRD facility is eligible for an outlier payment if its actual or imputed Medicare Allowable Payment MAP amount per treatment for ESRD outlier services exceeds a threshold. The MAP amount represents the average incurred amount per treatment for services that were or would have been considered separately billable services prior to January 1, 2011. The threshold is equal to the ESRD facilitys predicted ESRD outlier services MAP amount per treatment which is case-mix adjusted and described in the following paragraphs plus the fixed-dollar loss FDL amount. In accordance with Sec. 413.237c, facilities are paid 80 percent of the per treatment amount by which the imputed MAP amount for outlier services that is, the actual incurred amount exceeds this threshold. ESRD facilities are eligible to receive outlier payments for treating both adult and pediatric dialysis patients. In the CY 2011 ESRD PPS final rule and codified in Sec. 413.220b4, using 2007 data, we established the outlier percentage, which is used to reduce the per treatment base rate to account for the proportion of the estimated total payments under the ESRD PPS that are outlier payments, at 1.0 percent of total payments 75 FR 49142 through 49143. We also established the FDL amounts that are added to the predicted outlier services MAP amounts. The outlier services MAP amounts and FDL amounts are different for adult and pediatric patients due to differences in the utilization of separately billable services among adult and pediatric patients 75 FR 49140. As we explained in the CY 2011 ESRD PPS final rule 75 FR 49138 through 49139, the predicted outlier services MAP amounts for a patient are determined by multiplying the adjusted average outlier services MAP amount by the product of the patient-specific case-mix adjusters applicable using the outlier services payment multipliers developed from the regression analysis used to compute the payment adjustments. For CY 2022, we proposed that the outlier services MAP amounts and FDL amounts would be derived from claims data from CY 2020. As we stated in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36329, we believe that any adjustments made to the MAP amounts under the ESRD PPS should be based upon the most recent data year available to best predict any future outlier payments therefore, we proposed the outlier thresholds for CY 2022 would be based on utilization of renal dialysis items and services furnished under the ESRD PPS in CY 2020. We also stated that we recognize that the utilization of ESAs and other outlier services have continued to decline under the ESRD PPS, and that we have lowered the MAP amounts and FDL amounts every year under the ESRD PPS. As discussed in section II.B.1.c of this final rule, CY 2020 claims data show outlier payments represent approximately 0.6 percent of total payments.1 CY 2022 Update to the Outlier Services MAP Amounts and FDL Amounts For this final rule, the outlier services MAP amounts and FDL amounts were updated using 2020 claims data, as we proposed to do for CY 2022. The impact of this update is shown in Table 1, which compares the outlier services MAP amounts and FDL amounts used for the outlier policy in CY 2021 with the updated estimates for this final rule. The estimates for the CY 2022 outlier policy, which are included in Column II of Table 1, were inflation adjusted to reflect projected 2022 prices for outlier services.Page 61883GRAPHIC TIFF OMITTED TR08NO21.000 As demonstrated in Table 1, the estimated FDL amount per treatment that determines the CY 2022 outlier threshold amount for adults Column II 75.39 is lower than that used for the CY 2021 outlier policy Column I 122.49. The lower threshold is accompanied by a decrease in the adjusted average MAP for outlier services from 50.92 to 42.75 For pediatric patients, there is a decrease in the FDL amount from 44.78 to 26.02 There is a corresponding decrease in the adjusted average MAP for outlier services among pediatric patients, from 30.08 to 27.15 We estimate that the percentage of patient months qualifying for outlier payments in CY 2022 will be 7.08 percent for adult patients and 12.89 percent for pediatric patients, based on the 2020 claims data. The outlier MAP and FDL amounts continue to be lower for pediatric patients than adults due to the continued lower use of outlier services primarily reflecting lower use of ESAs and other injectable drugs.2 Outlier Percentage In the CY 2011 ESRD PPS final rule 75 FR 49081 and under Sec. 413.220b4, we reduced the per treatment base rate by 1 percent to account for the proportion of the estimated total payments under the ESRD PPS that are outlier payments as described in Sec. 413.237 Based on the 2020 claims, outlier payments represented approximately 0.6 percent of total payments, which is below the 1 percent target due to declines in the use of outlier services. As we stated in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36330, recalibration of the thresholds using 2020 data is expected to result in aggregate outlier payments close to the 1 percent target in CY 2022. We stated in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule that we believe the update to the outlier MAP and FDL amounts for CY 2022 would increase payments for ESRD beneficiaries requiring higher resource utilization. This would move us closer to meeting our 1 percent outlier policy goal, because we are using more current data for computing the MAP and FDL, which is more in line with current outlier services utilization rates. We noted in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule that recalibration of the FDL amounts would result in no change in payments to ESRD facilities for beneficiaries with renal dialysis items and services that are not eligible for outlier payments. The comments and our responses to the comments on our proposed updates to the outlier policy are set forth below. Comment Several commenters suggested alternatives to our proposed outlier MAP amounts, FDL amounts, and outlier percentage target for CY 2022. One large dialysis organization commented in support of using the most recent available CY 2020 claims data for determining the CY 2022 outlier services MAP amounts and FDL amounts, but suggested that CMS undertake further action to address the issue of outlier payments falling short of the 1 percent target. A professional organization of pediatric nephrologists expressed concern that the decreasing FDL and MAP amounts suggest that the cost of delivering pediatric ESRD care is not appropriately paid under Medicare by either the existing ESRD PPS bundled payment or through the outlier adjustment. Several commenters recommended that CMS set the CY 2022 outlier percentage less than 1 percent. For example, one commenter, a coalition of dialysis organizations, suggested that because the CY 2020 claims data showed that outlier payments represented approximately 0.6 percent of total ESRD PPS payments, CMS could set the CY 2022 outlier pool percentage at 0.6 percent. Similarly, a professional association suggested that because historical data shows that CMS regularly pays out between 0.5 and 0.6 percent of ESRD PPS payments as outlier payments, CMS should reduce the outlier percentage to better match the use of the outlier pool. Other commenters, including a large dialysis organization and a provider advocacy organization, urged CMS to reduce the CY 2022 outlier pool to no more than 0.5 percent of projectedPage 61884aggregate ESRD PPS spending. Another large dialysis organization recommended CMS adopt the proposed FDL and MAP amounts for CY 2022, but urged CMS to set the outlier percentage to 0.6 percent. Additionally, several of these commenters suggested that in any year when the outlier pool retains dollars that are not paid out, CMS should return those dollars to providers or reallocate those dollars to support reducing the barriers that create inequities in the care dialysis patients receive. Response We appreciate the support for the proposed use of CY 2020 data and the thoughtful suggestions provided by commenters. We acknowledge that, even with annually adjusting the MAP and FDL to reflect the most recent utilization and costs of ESRD PPS eligible outlier services, total outlier payments have not yet reached the 1 percent target. However, it is also true that use of eligible ESRD outlier services declined each year. That is, ESRD facilities incurred lower costs than anticipated, and those savings accrued to facilities more than offsetting the extent to which the consequent outlier payments fell short of the 1.0 percent target. We also note that declining FDL and MAP amounts do not in themselves suggest that the ESRD PPS fails to adequately pay for the delivery of either pediatric or adult ESRD care. Rather, the ESRD PPS outlier policy was established to account for unusual variations in the type or amount of medically necessary care. Declining FDL and MAP amounts suggest that there is less costly variation in such care that is not included in the ESRD PPS bundled payment. We appreciate the comments suggesting solutions for refining the outlier policy methodology, for example, reducing the outlier percentage withhold to less than 1 percent or establishing a mechanism that pays back ESRD facilities those allocated outlier amounts that did not pay out in the year projected. We did not propose any modifications to the ESRD PPS outlier policy for CY 2022, so we are not finalizing any changes to the methodology in this final rule. However, as discussed in section VI.E of the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36400, CMS is considering potential revisions to the calculation of the outlier percentage to address stakeholder concerns, including concerns about the 1 percent outlier percentage, and issued a request for information in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule to seek feedback on the acceptability of possible payment adjustment methods and to solicit information that would better inform future modifications to the methodology through rulemaking. Final Rule Action After considering the public comments, we are finalizing the updated outlier thresholds for CY 2022 displayed in Column II of Table 1 of this final rule and based on CY 2020 data.d. Final Impacts to the CY 2022 ESRD PPS Base Rate1 ESRD PPS Base Rate In the CY 2011 ESRD PPS final rule 75 FR 49071 through 49083, CMS established the methodology for calculating the ESRD PPS per-treatment base rate, that is, ESRD PPS base rate, and calculating the per treatment payment amount, which are codified at Sec. Sec. 413.220 and 413.230 The CY 2011 ESRD PPS final rule also provides a detailed discussion of the methodology used to calculate the ESRD PPS base rate and the computation of factors used to adjust the ESRD PPS base rate for projected outlier payments and budget neutrality in accordance with sections 1881b14Dii and 1881b14Aii of the Act, respectively. Specifically, the ESRD PPS base rate was developed from CY 2007 claims that is, the lowest per patient utilization year as required by section 1881b14Aii of the Act, updated to CY 2011, and represented the average per treatment MAP for composite rate and separately billable services. In accordance with section 1881b14D of the Act and our regulation at Sec. 413.230, the per-treatment payment amount is the sum of the ESRD PPS base rate, adjusted for the patient specific case-mix adjustments, applicable facility adjustments, geographic differences in area wage levels using an area wage index, and any applicable outlier payment, training adjustment add-on, TDAPA, and TPNIES.2 Annual Payment Rate Update for CY 2022 We are finalizing an ESRD PPS base rate for CY 2022 of 257.90 This update reflects several factors, described in more detail as follows Wage Index Budget-Neutrality Adjustment Factor We compute a wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor that is applied to the ESRD PPS base rate. For CY 2022, we did not propose any changes to the methodology used to calculate this factor, which is described in detail in the CY 2014 ESRD PPS final rule 78 FR 72174. We computed the final CY 2022 wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor using treatment counts from the 2020 claims and facility-specific CY 2021 payment rates to estimate the total dollar amount that each ESRD facility would have received in CY 2021. The total of these payments became the target amount of expenditures for all ESRD facilities for CY 2022. Next, we computed the estimated dollar amount that would have been paid for the same ESRD facilities using the ESRD PPS wage index for CY 2022. As discussed in section II.B.1.b of this final rule, the ESRD PPS wage index for CY 2022 includes an update to the most recent hospital wage data, use of the 2018 OMB delineations, and no cap on wage index decreases applied for CY 2022. The total of these payments becomes the new CY 2022 amount of wage-adjusted expenditures for all ESRD facilities. The wage index budget-neutrality factor is calculated as the target amount divided by the new CY 2022 amount. When we multiplied the wage index budget neutrality factor by the applicable CY 2022 estimated payments, aggregate payments to ESRD facilities would remain budget neutral when compared to the target amount of expenditures. That is, the wage index budget neutrality adjustment factor ensures that wage index adjustments do not increase or decrease aggregate Medicare payments with respect to changes in wage index updates. The CY 2022 wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor is 0.99985 This application would yield a CY 2022 ESRD PPS base rate of 253.09 prior to the application of the market basket increase 253.13 x 0.99985  253.09. Market Basket Increase Section 1881b14FiI of the Act provides that, beginning in 2012, the ESRD PPS payment amounts are required to be annually increased by the ESRD market basket percentage increase factor. The latest CY 2022 projection of the ESRDB market basket percentage increase factor is 2.4 percent. In CY 2022, this amount must be reduced by the productivity adjustment described in section 1886b3BxiII of the Act, as required by section 1881b14FiII of the Act. As discussed previously in section II.B.1.a of this final rule, the final productivity adjustment for CY 2021 is 0.5 percent, thus yielding an update to the base rate of 1.9 percent for CY 2022. Therefore, the final CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed base rate is 257.90 253.02 x 1.019  257.90. The comments and our responses to the comments on our updates to the CY 2022 ESRD PPS base rate are set forth below. Comment Several commenters raised concerns about the comorbidity case-mix adjustments under the ESRD PPSPage 61885and recommended eliminating them for CY 2022. Two commenters, including a large dialysis organization and a coalition of dialysis organizations encouraged CMS to eliminate the remaining comorbidity case-mix adjustments and thereby increase the ESRD PPS base rate for CY 2022. These commenters noted that the percent of claims with these conditions is relatively low and has been declining over time. These commenters argued that as the frequency of these conditions declines in the claims, maintaining these adjusters results in the loss of money from the system that could be redirected toward patient care. One of these commenters further argued that this means the dollars that Congress intended to go to providing items and services for individuals who receive dialysis are being inappropriately diverted away from that care. Both commenters further suggested that the years of discussion pertaining to patient-level adjustments, particularly the issues with the comorbid case-mix adjusters, and CMSs questions through the request for information RFI in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, should constitute enough notice to support their removal from the regression model for CY 2022, which includes the co-morbid case-mix adjusters in the calculation of the ESRD PPS payment. Response As the commenters noted, we included a detailed RFI regarding the ESRD PPS case mix adjustments in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 82 FR 36398 through 36409. A summary of the comments received in response to the RFI is provided in section VI.A of this final rule, and we will provide further information on the CMS ESRD PPS website in the future. CMS is considering alternative approaches to calculating the ESRD PPS case-mix adjustments that directly address stakeholder concerns, and appropriately reflect resource use and costs. The RFI in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule both sought feedback on the variation of case-mix adjustments with duration of dialysis treatment, and solicited information on alternative proxies for resource utilization that can be reported at the patienttreatment level in order to better inform future modifications to this methodology through rulemaking. With regard to the comment about removing the co-morbid adjustment from the case-mix for CY 2022, we note that due to the nature of regression analysis, which is how the current payment adjustors are set, making that type of adjustment would affect all the patient-level and facility-level adjustments. This can impact budget neutrality requirements and affect provider impacts differently than if adopted incrementally. Payment system changes can also require extensive efforts by CMS and providers to implement, and could not be implemented for CY 2022. While we discussed these case-mix adjustments in the RFI, we did not propose to make changes to the comorbidity case-mix adjustments for CY 2022 therefore, we are not finalizing any changes to that policy in this final rule. Comment Two commenters, a large dialysis organization and a non-profit health insurance organization in Puerto Rico, urged CMS to evaluate the accuracy of the ESRD PPS base rate as applied to payments for ESRD facilities located in Puerto Rico. These commenters encouraged CMS to consider the differences in patient characteristics between Puerto Rico and the mainland U.S , as well as differences in size, service capacity, and locality between the average ESRD facility in Puerto Rico versus other mainland providers. Response As mentioned previously in this section of the final rule, and as further discussed in section VI.D of the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36399, CMS is considering alternative approaches to calculating the case-mix adjustment, including duration of dialysis treatment to allocate composite rate costs for patients with higher resource use due to patient characteristics as reflected in the case-mix adjustments. We are also considering all the commenters suggestions in response to the RFI for alternative proxies for allocation of composite rate costs for those patients whose medical and physiologic characteristics require more resource use. We appreciate these comments and will take them into consideration to potentially inform future rulemaking. Final Rule Action We are finalizing a CY 2022 ESRD PPS base rate of 257.90 This amount reflects the CY 2022 wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor of 0.99985, and the CY 2022 ESRD PPS productivity-adjusted market basket update of 1.9 percent.e. Update to the Average per Treatment Offset Amount for Home Dialysis Machines In the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule 85 FR 71427, we expanded eligibility for the TPNIES under Sec. 413.236 to include certain capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines when used in the home for a single patient. To establish the basis of payment for the TPNIES for these items, we finalized the additional steps that the Medicare Administrative Contractors MACs must follow to calculate a pre-adjusted per treatment amount, using the prices they establish under Sec. 413.236e for a capital-related asset that is a home dialysis machine, as well as the methodology that CMS uses to calculate the average per treatment offset amount for home dialysis machines that is used in the MACs calculation, to account for the cost of the home dialysis machine that is already in the ESRD PPS base rate. For purposes of this final rule, we will refer to this as the TPNIES offset amount. The methodology for calculating the TPNIES offset amount is set forth in Sec. 413.236f3. Section Sec. 413.236f3v states that effective January 1, 2022, CMS annually updates the amount determined in Sec. 413.236f3iv by the ESRD bundled market basket percentage increase factor minus the productivity adjustment factor. The TPNIES for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines is based on 65 percent of the MAC-determined pre-adjusted per treatment amount, reduced by the TPNIES offset amount, and is paid for 2-calendar years. As we discussed in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36331, the CY 2021 TPNIES offset amount for capital-related equipment that are home dialysis machines used in the home is 9.32 We stated that the proposed CY 2022 ESRD bundled market basket increase factor minus the productivity adjustment is 1.0 percent 1.6 percent minus 0.6 percent. Applying the proposed update factor of 1.010 to the proposed CY 2021 TPNIES offset amount resulted in a proposed CY 2022 TPNIES offset amount of 9.41 9.32 x 1.010. We proposed to update this calculation using the most recent data available in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS final rule. The comments and our responses to the comments on the proposed update to the TPNIES offset amount are set forth below. Comment One large dialysis organization commented in support of the current TPNIES policy, but recommended that CMS recalculate the TPNIES offset amount using a 7-year depreciation schedule, which the commenter asserted would more accurately align with real-world home dialysis machine use. This commenter also recommended that CMS revise the TPNIES policy to allow for a modification to the ESRD PPS base rate to ensure ongoing access to innovative technologies. Response We appreciate the commenters suggestion for improvingPage 61886the TPNIES policy. As we discussed in the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule 85 FR 71421 through 71422, section 104.17 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual discusses that the useful life of a capital-related asset is its expected useful life to the provider, not necessarily the inherent useful or physical life. Further, the manual provides that under the Medicare program, only the American Hospital Association AHA guidelines may be used in selecting a proper useful life for computing depreciation. In keeping with the Medicare policy, we established reliance on the AHA guidelines to determine the useful life of a capital-related asset that is a home dialysis machine, which is 5-years and not the 7 years suggested by the commenter see 42 CFR 413.236fi. We note that we considered alternatives, but concluded that this approach was simpler and appropriate for encouraging and supporting the uptake of new and innovative renal dialysis equipment and supplies 85 FR 71422. We did not propose changes to the methodology for updating the TPNIES offset amount for CY 2022, and therefore we are not finalizing any changes to that methodology in this final rule. However, we will take these recommendations into consideration to potentially inform future rulemaking. Final Rule Action We are finalizing our proposal to calculate the CY 2022 TPNIES offset amount using the most recent data available. The CY 2021 TPNIES offset amount for capital-related equipment that are home dialysis machines used in the home is 9.32 As discussed previously in section II.B.1.a of this final rule, the CY 2022 ESRD bundled market basket increase factor minus the productivity adjustment is 1.9 percent 2.4 percent minus 0.5 percent. Applying the productivity adjustment factor of 1.019 to the CY 2021 TPNIES offset amount results in a CY 2022 TPNIES offset amount of 9.50 9.32 x 1.019.f. TDAPA and TPNIES Public Comments and Responses We also received several public comments on topics related to the TPNIES and the TDAPA policies under the ESRD PPS, including from individuals, such as ESRD beneficiaries, individual health care providers, manufacturers, healthcare groups, patient advocacy organizations, hospital associations, dialysis associations, as well as various dialysis, kidney, and professional organizations. While these comments related to issues that we either did not discuss in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule or that we discussed for background or context, but for which we did not propose changes, a summary of the significant comments and our responses are set forth below. Comment Commenters overwhelmingly wrote in support of innovation in ESRD management generally and some specifically mentioned existing or upcoming technologies they thought would benefit ESRD patients. Other commenters expressed interest in seeing improvements in peritoneal dialysis, including on-line generation of dialysate and prevention of infections. Commenters also expressed support for home hemodialysis, citing its flexibility, convenience, and the comfort it provides patients. Commenters expressed interest in seeing improvements in home hemodialysis such as lower costs, more availability, better cannulation, reduced burden on patients and caregivers, and more convenient generation of dialysate. Commenters also stated they would like to see improvements in home dialysis that would increase retention, improve quality of delivered dialysate, or reduce complications. Response We appreciate the supportive comments regarding innovation in ESRD therapy. Like the commenters, CMS supports innovation in the ESRD space and we look forward to seeing new technologies that improve care for beneficiaries with ESRD. Comments Commenters provided input on the substantial clinical improvement criteria for the TPNIES under Sec. 413.236b5 and Sec. 412.87b1, offering specific recommendations on what CMS should consider in making a determination of substantial clinical improvement for the TPNIES. Commenters suggested that certain innovations could be considered evidence of substantial clinical improvement over existing technologies, such as Technical specifications that make home dialysis easier for disadvantaged persons, real time dialysis fluid preparation, and real-time monitoring of patients treatment sessions. Many commenters encouraged CMS to utilize evidence outside of randomized controlled trials RCTs as a way of demonstrating significant clinical improvement due to the challenges of running clinical trials involving patients with ESRD, including difficulty in patient recruitment and financial barriers for innovators to conduct these types of large-scale, long-term trials. One commenter who agreed with this stated that CMS also should not only rely on short, small-scale studies conducted by device manufacturers as the standard for substantial clinical improvement. A home dialysis advocacy organization commented that evidence from a clinical trial, abstracts of data, and expert opinion, such as letters from medical professionals, are sufficient to support a showing of substantial clinical improvement, rather than RCTs. That same commenter added that given the challenges specific to conducting studies in the ESRD space, real-world evidence gathered from studies conducted outside the U.S may be extrapolated to Medicare beneficiaries when appropriate. One commenter, a beneficiary, emphasized that patients may have a drastically different perspective of substantial clinical improvement compared to CMS. That commenter stated that greater flexibility is of the utmost importance to home dialysis patients and, therefore, therapies that allow patients with ESRD to resume their normal day-to-day activities should be considered to show substantial clinical improvement. Other commenters also encouraged the use of patient preferences, patient-reported outcomes, and other patient-centered data when evaluating substantial clinical improvement. A commenter encouraged CMS to weigh the reduction of patient and care partner burden, improved communication with the care team, and improved safety through the reduction of severe adverse events in the evaluation of evidence. Other commenters offered suggestions for CMSs current process of evaluating evidence of substantial clinical improvement. Commenters asked that CMS provide guidance on evidence of substantial clinical improvement specific to the ESRD space, such as the development of a set of ESRD patient-reported outcomes for assessing substantial clinical improvement criteria. Other commenters also suggested using a panel of patients with ESRD to assist with tasks such as developing the set of patient-reported outcomes or providing insight for these outcomes during the evaluation process. Some commenters asked CMS to clarify how data and real-world evidence submitted as part of a TPNIES application is reviewed and weighed during the review process. Response We appreciate the comments regarding the CMS evaluation process for the substantial clinical improvement criterion for the TPNIES. In response to commenters suggestions regarding the use of expert opinions, clinical trials, abstracts of data, unpublished sources, and letters from health care providers in our analysis, we note that under Sec. 413.236b5, CMS may consider all of these types of data,Page 61887among others, in making a determination of substantial clinical improvement. A list of information sources that we may consider in our determination is set forth in Sec. 412.87b1iii. Additionally, under Sec. 412.87b1iiiN, CMS may consider other appropriate information sources not otherwise listed in our regulations on substantial clinical improvement. Further, we are taking the opportunity to clarify that RCTs, while potentially informative, are not required under existing regulations to demonstrate substantial clinical improvement for purpose of the TPNIES. While we did not propose changes to the substantial clinical improvement criteria for the TPNIES in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, we will consider these comments for future rulemaking. We encourage ESRD patients and patient advocacy organizations to submit comments on our annual ESRD PPS proposed rules to provide their perspectives on TPNIES applications. Comment Several commenters suggested changes to the TPNIES policy under the ESRD PPS. Commenters suggested using FDA determinations for example, Breakthrough Device designations in evaluating TPNIES applications. Commenters also asked for CMS to provide increased feedback to applicants throughout the TPNIES application process, including providing Parallel feedback on data needed to support a TPNIES application as the manufacturers are working towards FDA marketing authorization, public review of the complete application prior to finalizing TPNIES application decisions, and an appeal process for manufacturers whose TPNIES applications were not approved. In addition, commenters recommended that CMS remove MACs discretion in determining pricing of new and innovative renal dialysis equipment and supplies, as provided under Sec. 413.236e, and requested that CMS set more defined payment parameters and public transparency around pricing. Other commenters suggested expanding the TPNIES policy to allow TPNIES payments to ESRD facilities with home dialysis devices on operating leases and to expand the TPNIES eligibility to include all capital-related assets, not just home dialysis machines, as allowed under Sec. 413.236b6. We also received comments requesting various extensions to the TPNIES application deadlines and payment periods such as Extending the duration of the TPNIES payment to 3 years, extending application timetables for device manufacturers applying for the TPNIES in the early years of the policy, and extending application timetables for manufacturers impacted by the COVID-19 PHE. Response We thank the public for their comments. Because we did not propose any changes to the TPNIES policy in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, we are not making any changes to that policy in this final rule however, we will consider the commenters recommendations for future rulemaking. Comment Several commenters also suggested changes to the TDAPA policy under Sec. 413.234 For example, one commenter stated that CMS should consider implementing the substantial clinical improvement criteria used to evaluate the TPNIES applications for the TDAPA applications, and another commenter stated that CMS should not apply the TDAPA to biosimilar drugs. Response We thank the public for their comments. Because we did not propose any changes to the TDAPA policy in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, we are not making any changes to that policy in this final rule however, we will consider the commenters recommendations for future rulemaking.C. Transitional Add-On Payment Adjustment for New and Innovative Equipment and Supplies TPNIES for CY 2022 Payment1. Background In the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule 84 FR 60681 through 60698, CMS established the transitional add-on payment adjustment for new and innovative equipment and supplies TPNIES under the ESRD PPS, under the authority of section 1881b14Div of the Act, in order to support ESRD facility use and beneficiary access to these new technologies. We established this add-on payment adjustment to help address the unique circumstances experienced by ESRD facilities when incorporating new and innovative equipment and supplies into their businesses and to support ESRD facilities transitioning or testing these products during the period when they are new to market. We added Sec. 413.236 to establish the eligibility criteria and payment policies for the TPNIES. In the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule 84 FR 60650, we established in Sec. 413.236b that for dates of service occurring on or after January 1, 2020, we will provide the TPNIES to an ESRD facility for furnishing a covered equipment or supply only if the item 1 Has been designated by CMS as a renal dialysis service under Sec. 413.171 2 is new, meaning granted marketing authorization by the Food and Drug Administration FDA on or after January 1, 2020 3 is commercially available by January 1 of the particular calendar year, meaning the year in which the payment adjustment would take effect 4 has a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System HCPCS application submitted in accordance with the official Level II HCPCS coding procedures by September 1 of the particular calendar year 5 is innovative, meaning it meets the substantial clinical improvement criteria specified in the Inpatient Prospective Payment System IPPS regulations at Sec. 412.87b1 and related guidance, and 6 is not a capital related asset that an ESRD facility has an economic interest in through ownership regardless of the manner in which it was acquired. Regarding the innovation requirement in Sec. 413.236b5, in the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule 84 FR 60690, we stated that we will use the following criteria to evaluate substantial clinical improvement for purposes of the TPNIES under the ESRD PPS based on the IPPS substantial clinical improvement criteria in Sec. 412.87b1 and related guidance A new technology represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. First, CMS considers the totality of the circumstances when making a determination that a new renal dialysis equipment or supply represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. Second, a determination that a new renal dialysis equipment or supply represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of Medicare beneficiaries means one of the following The new renal dialysis equipment or supply offers a treatment option for a patient population unresponsive to, or ineligible for, currently available treatments or The new renal dialysis equipment or supply offers the ability to diagnose a medical condition in a patient population where that medical condition is currently undetectable, or offers the ability to diagnose a medical condition earlier in a patient population than allowed by currently available methods, and there must also be evidence that use of the new renalPage 61888dialysis service to make a diagnosis affects the management of the patient or The use of the new renal dialysis equipment or supply significantly improves clinical outcomes relative to renal dialysis services previously available as demonstrated by one or more of the following A reduction in at least one clinically significant adverse event, including a reduction in mortality or a clinically significant complication a decreased rate of at least one subsequent diagnostic or therapeutic intervention a decreased number of future hospitalizations or physician visits a more rapid beneficial resolution of the disease process treatment including, but not limited to, a reduced length of stay or recovery time an improvement in one or more activities of daily living an improved quality of life or, a demonstrated greater medication adherence or compliance or, The totality of the circumstances otherwise demonstrates that the new renal dialysis equipment or supply substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. Third, evidence from the following published or unpublished information sources from within the U.S or elsewhere may be sufficient to establish that a new renal dialysis equipment or supply represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of Medicare beneficiaries Clinical trials, peer reviewed journal articles study results meta-analyses consensus statements white papers patient surveys case studies reports systematic literature reviews letters from major healthcare associations editorials and letters to the editor and public comments. Other appropriate information sources may be considered. Fourth, the medical condition diagnosed or treated by the new renal dialysis equipment or supply may have a low prevalence among Medicare beneficiaries. Fifth, the new renal dialysis equipment or supply may represent an advance that substantially improves, relative to services or technologies previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of a subpopulation of patients with the medical condition diagnosed or treated by the new renal dialysis equipment or supply. In the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule 84 FR 60681 through 60698, we also established a process modeled after IPPSs process of determining if a new medical service or technology meets the substantial clinical improvement criteria specified in Sec. 412.87b1. Specifically, similar to the IPPS New Technology Add-On Payment, we wanted to align our goals with the agencys efforts to transform the healthcare delivery system for the ESRD beneficiary through competition and innovation to provide patients with better value and results. As we discussed in the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule 84 FR 60682, we believe it is appropriate to facilitate access to new and innovative equipment and supplies through add-on payments similar to the IPPS New Technology Add-On Payment and to provide stakeholders with standard criteria for both inpatient and outpatient settings. In Sec. 413.236c, we established a process for our announcement of TPNIES determinations and a deadline for consideration of new renal dialysis equipment or supply applications under the ESRD PPS. CMS will consider whether a new renal dialysis equipment or supply meets the eligibility criteria specified in Sec. 413.236b and summarize the applications received in the annual ESRD PPS proposed rules. Then, after consideration of public comments, we will announce the results in the Federal Register as part of our annual updates and changes to the ESRD PPS in the ESRD PPS final rule. In the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule, we also specified certain deadlines for the application requirements. We noted that we would only consider a complete application received by February 1 prior to the particular calendar year. In addition, we required that FDA marketing authorization for the equipment or supply must occur by September 1 prior to the particular calendar year. We also stated in the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule 84 FR 60690 through 60691 that we would establish a workgroup of CMS medical and other staff to review the materials submitted as part of the TPNIES application, public comments, FDA marketing authorization, and HCPCS application information and assess the extent to which the product provides substantial clinical improvement over current technologies. In the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule, we established Sec. 413.236d to provide a payment adjustment for a new and innovative renal dialysis equipment or supply. We stated that the TPNIES is paid for 2-calendar years. Following payment of the TPNIES, the ESRD PPS base rate will not be modified and the new and innovative renal dialysis equipment or supply will become an eligible outlier service as provided in Sec. 413.237 Regarding the basis of payment for the TPNIES, in the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule, we finalized at Sec. 413.236e that the TPNIES is based on 65 percent of the price established by the MACs, using the information from the invoice and other specified sources of information. In the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule 85 FR 71410 through 71464, we made several changes to the TPNIES eligibility criteria at Sec. 413.236 First, we revised the definition of new at Sec. 413.236b2 as within 3 years beginning on the date of the FDA marketing authorization. Second, we changed the deadline for TPNIES applicants HCPCS Level II code application submission from September 1 of the particular calendar year to the HCPCS Level II code application deadline for biannual Coding Cycle 2 for durable medical equipment, orthotics, prosthetics, and supplies DMEPOS items and services as specified in the HCPCS Level II coding guidance on the CMS website prior to the calendar year. In addition, a copy of the applicable FDA marketing authorization must be submitted to CMS by the HCPCS Level II code application deadline for biannual Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services as specified in the HCPCS Level II coding guidance on the CMS website in order for the equipment or supply to be eligible for the TPNIES the following year. Third, we revised Sec. 413.236b5 to remove a reference to related guidance on the substantial clinical improvement criterion, as the guidance had already been codified. Finally, in the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule, we expanded the TPNIES policy to include certain capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines when used in the home for a single patient. We explained that capital-related assets are defined in the Provider Reimbursement Manual chapter 1, section 104.1 as assets that a provider has an economic interest in through ownership regardless of the manner in which they were acquired. We noted that examples of capital-related assets for ESRD facilities are dialysis machines and water purification systems. We explained that, although we stated in the CY 2020 ESRD PPS proposed rule 84 FR 38354 that we did not believe capital-related assets should be eligible for additional payment through the TPNIES because the cost of these items is captured in cost reports, they depreciate over time, and are generally used for multiple patients, there were a number of other factors we considered that led us to consider expanding eligibility for these technologies in the CY 2021 ESRD PPSPage 61889rulemaking. We explained that, following publication of the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule, we continued to study the issue of payment for capital-related assets under the ESRD PPS, taking into account information from a wide variety of stakeholders and recent developments and initiatives regarding kidney care. For example, we considered various HHS home dialysis initiatives, Executive Orders to transform kidney care, and how the risk of COVID-19 for particularly vulnerable ESRD beneficiaries could be mitigated by encouraging home dialysis. After closely considering these issues, we proposed a revision to Sec. 413.236b6 in the CY 2021 ESRD PPS proposed rule to provide an exception to the general exclusion for capital-related assets from eligibility for the TPNIES for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines when used in the home for a single patient and that meet the other eligibility criteria in Sec. 413.235b, and finalized the exception as proposed in the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule. We finalized the same determination process for TPNIES applications for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines as for all other TPNIES applications that we will consider whether the new home dialysis machine meets the eligibility criteria specified in Sec. 413.236b and announce the results in the Federal Register as part of our annual updates and changes to the ESRD PPS. Per Sec. 413.236c, we will only consider, for additional payment using the TPNIES for a particular calendar year, an application for a capital-related asset that is a home dialysis machine received by February 1 prior to the particular calendar year. If the application is not received by February 1, the application will be denied and the applicant is able to reapply within 3 years beginning on the date of FDA marketing authorization in order to be considered for the TPNIES, in accordance with Sec. 413.236b2. In the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule, at Sec. 413.236f, we finalized a pricing methodology for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines when used in the home for a single patient, which requires the MACs to calculate the annual allowance and the preadjusted per treatment amount. The pre-adjusted per treatment amount is reduced by an estimated average per treatment offset amount to account for the costs already paid through the ESRD PPS base rate. The CY 2021 TPNIES offset amount was 9.32 We finalized that this amount will be updated on an annual basis so that it is consistent with how the ESRD PPS base rate is updated. We revised Sec. 413.236d to reflect that we would pay 65 percent of the pre-adjusted per treatment amount minus the offset for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines when used in the home for a single patient. We revised Sec. 413.236d2 to reflect that following payment of the TPNIES, the ESRD PPS base rate will not be modified and the new and innovative renal dialysis equipment or supply will be an eligible outlier service as provided in Sec. 413.237, except a capital-related asset that is a home dialysis machine will not be an eligible outlier service as provided in Sec. 413.237 In summary, under the current eligibility requirements in Sec. 413.236b, CMS provides for a TPNIES to an ESRD facility for furnishing a covered equipment or supply only if the item 1 Has been designated by CMS as a renal dialysis service under Sec. 413.171 2 Is new, meaning within 3 years beginning on the date of the FDA marketing authorization 3 Is commercially available by January 1 of the particular calendar year, meaning the year in which the payment adjustment would take effect 4 Has a complete HCPCS Level II code application submitted in accordance with the HCPCS Level II coding procedures on the CMS website, by the HCPCS Level II code application deadline for biannual Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services as specified in the HCPCS Level II coding guidance on the CMS website prior to the calendar year 5 Is innovative, meaning it meets the criteria specified in Sec. Sec. 412.87b1 and 6 Is not a capital-related asset, except for capital-related assets that are home dialysis machines. We received two applications for the TPNIES for CY 2022. One applicant, CloudCath the applicant for the CloudCath Peritoneal Dialysis Drain Set Monitoring System, withdrew its application from consideration after the issuance of the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule because it did not receive FDA marketing authorization by July 6, 2021, which was the HCPCS Level II code application deadline for biannual Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services. Under Sec. Sec. 413.236c, an applicant for the TPNIES must receive FDA marketing authorization for its new equipment or supply by the HCPCS Level II Code application deadline for biannual Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services as specified in the HCPCS Level II coding guidance on the CMS website prior to the particular calendar year. Therefore, the CloudCath Peritoneal Dialysis Drain Set Monitoring System is not eligible for consideration for the TPNIES for CY 2022. We are not including in this final rule the description and discussion of this application, which was included in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule. We note that we received public comments on the application that was withdrawn. However, because the application was withdrawn and thus the technology is ineligible for the TPNIES for CY 2022, we are not summarizing nor responding to public comments regarding the TPNIES criteria for this technology in this final rule. A discussion of the remaining application, which met this deadline, is presented in this final rule. The application discussed in this final rule is for a technology commonly used for the treatment of ESRD Hemodialysis HD. A detailed definition for HD is included in Chapter 11, Section 10 of the Medicare Benefits Policy Manual Pub. L. 100-02.2 In brief, HD is a process that involves blood passing through an artificial kidney machine and the waste products diffusing across a manmade membrane into a bath solution known as dialysate after which the cleansed blood is returned to the patients body. HD is accomplished usually in 3 to 5 hour sessions, 3 times a week.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2 Medicare Benefits Policy Manual Pub. L. 100-102, available at Tablosupreg System Outset Medical, Inc. submitted an application for the TPNIES for the Tablosupreg System for CY 2022. According to the applicant, the technology is an HD machine that has been designed for patient-driven self-care and to minimize system training time. The applicant stated that the system is intended to substantially improve the treatment of people with ESRD by removing barriers to home dialysis. The applicant explained that the Tablosupreg System is comprised of 1 the Tablosupreg Console with integrated water purification, on-demand dialysate production, and a touchscreen interface 2 a proprietary, disposable, single-use pre-strung cartridge and 3 the Tablosupreg Connectivity and Data Ecosystem. Per the applicant, the system is built to function in a connected setting with cloud-based system monitoring, patient analytics and clinical recordkeeping. The applicant stated that the Tablosupreg Systems features combine to provide a significantly differentiated HD solution with many benefits. First, the applicant stated that the Tablosupreg Systems touchscreen interface made it easy to learn and use, guiding users through treatment using step-by-stepPage 61890instructions with simple words and animation. The applicant also stated that instructions include non-technical language and color-coded parts to enable easier training, faster set-up, and simpler management including clear alarm explanations and resolution instructions. Second, the applicant stated that the Tablosupreg System can accommodate treatments at home, allowing for flexibility in treatment frequencies, durations, and flow rates. Per the applicant, the Tablosupreg System did not have a pre-configured dialyzer, which allows clinicians to use a broad range of dialyzer types and manufactures, allowing for greater customization of treatment for the patient. The applicant stated that this was an improvement over the incumbent home device, which requires a separate device component and complex process to switch to another dialyzer. Third, the applicant stated that the Tablosupreg System is an all-in-one system with integrated water purification and on-demand dialysate production, eliminating the need for industrial water treatment rooms that are required to operate traditional HD machines. The applicant also stated that electronic data capture and automatic wireless transmission eliminate the need for manual record keeping by the patient, care partner, or nurse. Per the applicant, a single-use Tablosupreg Cartridge with pre-strung blood, saline, and infusion tubing and a series of sensor-receptors mounted to an organizer snaps into the system, minimizing difficult connections that require additional training. The applicant stated that automated features, including an integrated blood pressure monitor, air removal, priming, and blood return, minimize user errors, save time, and streamline the user experience. Fourth, the applicant stated that the Tablosupreg Systems two-way wireless connectivity and data analytics provide the ability to continuously activate new capabilities and enhancements through wireless software updates, while also enabling predictive preventative maintenance to maximize machine uptime. The applicant stated that currently 88 percent of patients receive HD in a clinic 3 times per week, for 3.0 to 4.5 hours a day and fewer than 2 percent perform HD treatment at home.3 The applicant stated that 25 to 36 percent of home HD patients return to in-center care within 1 year of initiating HD at home.4 5 Per the applicant, barriers to home dialysis adoption and retention have been well studied and include treatment burden for patients and care partner fatigue technical challenges with operating a HD machine space, home modifications, and supplies management patients not wanting medical equipment in the home and safety concerns.6 7--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3 United States Renal Data System. 2020 USRDS Annual Data Report Epidemiology of kidney disease in the United States, End-Stage Renal Disease Chapter 2.

Exploring Barriers and Potential Solutions in Home Dialysis An NKF-KDOQI Conference Outcomes Report American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Volume 73, Issue 3, 363-371.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant stated that innovation in making home dialysis more accessible to patients has been lacking due to a lack of investment funding, limited incremental reimbursement for new technology, and a consolidated, price-sensitive dialysis provider market where the lack of market competition is costly and has been associated with increased hospitalizations in dialysis patients.8 The applicant stated that the Tablosupreg System was designed to address many system-related barriers that result in patients deciding on in-center care andor stopping home modalities due to the burden of self-managed therapy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8 Erickson, K.F , Zheng, Y., Ho, V., Winkelmayer, W.C , Bhattacharya, J., amp Chertow, G.M 2018. Market Competition and Health Outcomes in Hemodialysis. Health services research, 535, 3680-3703. The applicant stated that while peritoneal dialysis PD, like HD, removes excess fluid and waste from the body, it has a different mechanism of action and relies on the bodys own membrane, the peritoneum, to act as the dialyzer. Per the applicant, PD requires surgical placement of a catheter in the abdomen and utilizes a cleansing fluid, dialysate, that must be infused and dwell in the abdomen to remove waste products from the blood. The applicant stated that PD must be conducted daily to achieve adequate dialysis and can be conducted manually or via a cycler while in contrast, HD directly cleanses the blood with the use of a HD machine, dialysate and a dialyzer, which acts as an artificial kidney in removing excess fluid and toxins. The applicant stated that HD also requires surgical placement of a dialysis access, which is usually in the form of a catheter or a more permanent arteriovenous fistula.9--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9 Blake, P.G , Quinn, R.R , amp Oliver, M.J 2013. Peritoneal dialysis and the process of modality selection. Peritoneal dialysis international Journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis, 333, 233-241. The applicant asserted that PD is the dominant home therapy used around the world, but should not be solely relied upon to increase growth in home dialysis, as there are physiological contraindications.10 The applicant also stated that there is recent evidence that post 90-day mortality is higher in PD patients than in HD patients. Per the applicant, multivariable risk-adjusted analyses demonstrated that the mortality hazard ratio of HD versus PD is 0.74 95 percent confidence interval CI, 0.68-0.80 in the 270 to 360-day period after starting dialysis.11 The applicant stated that patients and clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of both options and select the one that meets the individual patients preferences, goals, values and physiology. Per the applicant, because PD relies on the patients own membrane, physiologic changes can occur and result in patients who are unable to continue PD due to loss of the ability to achieve adequacy. The applicant stated that these home patients could consider home HD rather than a return to in-center and noted that the practice of transitioning from one home modality to another is acknowledged by experts to be underutilized and is particularly pronounced in the U.S , where the ratio of PD use to home HD is 61,12 as compared to 41 in Canada.13--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10 Ibid. 11 Mukhopadhyay, P., Woodside, K.J , Schaubel, D.E , Repeck, K., McCullough, K., Shahinian, V.B , . . . amp Saran, R. 2020.

Per the applicant, NxStagesupreg is the only other mobile HD machine that is approved for home use.1 Renal Dialysis Service Criterion Sec. 413.236b1 With respect to the first TPNIES eligibility criterion under Sec. 413.236b1, whether the item has been designated by CMS as a renal dialysis service under Sec. 413.171, maintenance dialysis treatments and all associated services, including historically defined dialysis-related drugs, laboratory tests, equipment, supplies, and staff time, were included in the composite rate for renal dialysis services as of December 31, 2010 75 FR 49036. An in-home HD machine would be considered equipment essential for the provision of maintenance dialysis. We received no public comments on whether the Tablosupreg System meets this criterion. Based on its status as an in-home HD machine, we consider the Tablosupreg System to be a renal dialysis service under Sec. 413.171 2 Newness Criterion Sec. 413.236b2 With respect to the second TPNIES eligibility criterion under Sec. 413.236b2, whether the item is new, meaning within 3 years beginning on the date of the FDA marketing authorization, the applicant indicated that the Tablosupreg System received FDA marketing authorization for home use on March 31, 2020.14 We received no public comments on whether the Tablosupreg System meets the newness criterion. Based on the information provided by the applicant, we agree that the Tablosupreg System meets the newness criterion.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14 As we stated in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36334, in reviewing the enclosure to which the March 31, 2020 FDA authorization letter refers, the applicants Section 510k submission indicated that the Tablosupreg Cartridge was reviewed separately from the Tablosupreg System and has its own separate 510k clearance. We further stated that, in the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule, CMS determined that the cartridge did not meet the newness criterion for the TPNIES 85 FR 71464 and as such, the cartridge was not new.---------------------------------------------------------------------------3 Commercial Availability Criterion Sec. 413.236b3 With respect to the third eligibility criterion under Sec. 413.236b3, whether the item is commercially available by January 1 of the particular calendar year, meaning the year in which the payment adjustment would take effect, applicant indicated that the Tablosupreg System became available for home use on April 1, 2020. We received no public comments on whether the Tablosupreg System meets the commercial availability criterion. Based on the information provided by the applicant, we agree that the Tablosupreg System meets the commercial availability criterion.4 HCPCS Level II Application Criterion Sec. 413.236b4 The fourth TPNIES eligibility criterion, under Sec. 413.236b4, is whether the applicant has submitted a complete HCPCS Level II code application in accordance with the HCPCS Level II coding procedures on the CMS website, by the HCPCS Level II code application deadline for biannual Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services as specified in the HCPCS Level II coding guidance on the CMS website prior to the particular calendar year. The applicant indicated that it submitted a HCPCS Level II code application on July 6, 2021, which was same day as the deadline specified HCPCS Level II code application deadline for biannual Coding Cycle 2 for DMEPOS items and services specified in CMS guidance.15 We received no public comments on whether the Tablosupreg System meets this criterion. Based on the information provided by the applicant, we agree the applicant has met the HCPCS Level II application criterion.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15 Innovation Criterion Sec. Sec. 413.236b5 and 412.87b1 With respect to the fifth TPNIES eligibility criterion under Sec. 413.236b5, that the item is innovative, meaning it meets the substantial clinical improvement criteria specified in Sec. 412.87b1, the applicant claimed that the Tablosupreg System significantly improves clinical outcomes relative to the current standard of care for home HD services, which it identified as the incumbent NxStagesupreg home dialysis machine. The applicant presented the following substantial clinical improvement claims 1 Decreased treatment frequency with adequate dialysis clearance 2 increased adherence to dialysis treatment and retention to home therapy and 3 improved patient quality of life. The applicant supported these claims with the Tablosupreg System Investigational Device Exemption IDE Study 16 and secondary support from four papers 17 18 19 20 and two posters.21 22 The applicant also provided comparison data from three studies directly related to the incumbent 23 24 25 and an additional study that, based on the timeframe of the study, likely involved participants undergoing treatment with NxStagesupreg although the article does not directly reference the incumbent.26--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16 Clinicaltrials.gov website.

Specifically, the applicant submitted numerous supplemental background materials related to the dialysis industry, reimbursement patterns, modalities, treatment frequencies, patient adherence, hospitalization rates, and quality of life. The applicant also submitted several letters of support for the Tablosupreg System three from dialysis patients, three from nephrologists, and one from a dialysis clinic nurse. These letters emphasized benefits of the Tablosupreg System, including reduced frequency of dialysis treatment, improved home dialysis retention, reduced patient and caregiver burden, reduced patient fatigue, and improved patient quality of life.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27 86 FR 36335-36342.---------------------------------------------------------------------------a Applicant Substantial Clinical Improvement Sources As we discussed in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36335, the applicants primary support for its three substantial clinical improvement claims came from a prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized crossover study that compared in-center and in-home HD performance using the Tablosupreg System. Per the applicant, this study is referred to as the Tablosupreg System Investigational Device Exemption IDE Study and the original study protocol and amendments were approved by FDA and registered on as ID NCT02460263. The applicant stated that of the 30 participants enrolled 17 White and 13 Black or African American, 28 18 men and 10 women completed the study. Thirteen of the participants had previous home HD experience with NxStagesupreg, and the remainder had previously received conventional in-center HD care. The applicant also noted that the Tablosupreg System IDE study sample was comprised of a representative cohort of dialysis patients and reported that it was similar to the population studied for the IDE study for the incumbent NxStagesupreg. As described in the study protocol, the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were a standardized weekly KtV of greater than or equal to 2.1 and ultrafiltration fluid removal value as reported by the device within ten percent of the expected fluid removal based on the ultrafiltration prescription and the Tablosupreg System Console fluid removal algorithm, respectively.28 We clarified in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule that KtV is a value used to quantify dialysis treatment adequacy and K  dialyzer clearance, t  time, and V  Volume of distribution of urea. The applicant stated that each study participant served as his or her own control and remained in the trial for approximately 21 weeks, during which time they were prescribed HD with the Tablosupreg System on a 4 times per week schedule. The applicant explained that the trial consisted of 4 treatment periods 1 A 1 week, in-center run-in period 2 an in-center period of 32 treatments approximately 8 weeks during which ESRD facility staff managed the dialysis treatments 3 a transition period of up to 4 weeks to train the patient and care partner in managing the dialysis and 4 a final in-home period of 32 treatments approximately 8 weeks.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28 Clinicaltrials.gov website. Last Updated July 1, 2020. With respect to the applicants secondary sources of support, a poster presentation from Alvarez, et al., presented dialysis adequacy data collected from a retrospective review of 29 patients 18 males, 11 females and 17 percent Black, 10 percent Hispanic dialysis records. The study compared KtV results of patients aged 34-84 receiving dialysis using the Tablosupreg System to patients receiving dialysis from a conventional HD machine. The majority of patients used a fistula or graft 59 percent fistula, 28 percent graft, 10 percent catheter. One hundred ninety two dialysis treatments were conducted on a thrice-weekly schedule using the Tablosupreg System with a dialysate flow rate of 300 mL per minute. A single pool KtV of greater than 1.2 was achieved in 94 percent of treatments in patients less than 90 kg with an average duration of treatment at 224 -29 minutes and in 79 percent of treatments in patients greater than 90 kg with an average duration of treatment at 249 -27 minutes. The average achieved KtV was 1.4 -0.2 among treatments provided with the Tablosupreg System. Eighty-eight treatments were conducted using a conventional HD machine with a dialysate flow rate of 500 mL per minute. A single pool KtV of greater than 1.2 was achieved in 93 percent of treatments in patients less than 90 kg with an average duration of treatment at 227 -21 minutes and in 83 percent of treatments in patients greater than 90 kg with an average duration of treatment at 249 -14 minutes. The average achieved KtV was 1.6 -0.4 among the conventional HD treatments.29--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29 Alvarez, Luis et al. Urea Clearance Results in Patients Dialyzed Thrice-weekly Using a Dialysate Flow of 300 mLmin, clinical abstract, presented March 2019, Annual Dialysis Conference, Dallas, TX.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next, an article from Chertow, et al., described additional data from the Tablosupreg System IDE study discussed previously, including health-related quality of life, to further assess the safety of home HD with the Tablosupreg System. Demographic information identified the mean age as 49.8  13 years, 62 percent male, 62 percent White, 38 percent Black or African American, 23 percent Hispanic or Latino, 68 percent Not Hispanic or Latino, and 8 percent not reported, among patients established on home HD. Among the patients new to home HD, the mean age was identified as 54.2  10.4 years, 65 percent male, 53 percent White, 47 percent Black or African American, 29 percent Hispanic or Latino, 71 percent Not Hispanic or Latino, and 0 percent not reported. Twenty-eight of 30 patients 93 percent completed all trial periods. Adherence to the prescribed 4 treatments per week schedule was 96 percent in-center and 99 percent in-home. The median time to recovery was 1.5 hours during the in-center and 2 hours during the at-home phase of the trial. Median index values on the 5-level EuroQol-5 Dimension EQ-5D-5L a self-assessed, health related, quality of life questionnaire were similar during the in-center as compared to in-home dialysis at 0.832 and 0.826, respectively. Patients new to home HD had lower median values 0.751 for both in-center and in-home periods. Patients who had used home dialysis prior to the trial had higher median values during both in-center 0.903 and in-home 0.906 periods. Patients reported feeling alert or well-rested with little difficulty falling or staying asleep or feeling tired and worn out when using the Tablosupreg System in either environment. The authors concluded that when using the Tablosupreg System in-home, patients reported similar time to recovery, general health status, and sleep quality compared to using the Tablosupreg System in-center.30--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30 Chertow, G.M , Alvarez, L., Plumb, T.J , Prichard, S.S , amp Aragon, M. 2020. Patient-reported outcomes from the investigational device exemption study of the Tablo hemodialysis system. Hemodialysis International, 244, 480-486.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next, an article from Leypoldt, et al., described the use of uremic solute kinetic models to assess dialysis adequacy via theoretical single pool KtV levels when varying the dialysis blood flow rates and the patient urea volume of distribution. A comparison was made between dialysate flows of 300 and 500 mLmin at blood flows of both 300 and 400 mLmin. The patient urea volume ofPage 61893distribution range modeled by the authors ranged from 25 to 45 L. Under ideal conditions, the authors demonstrated that with a blood flow of 300 mL per minute, a single pool KtV of greater than 1.2 could be achieved in patients with a urea volume of distribution of 35 L and 240 minutes of dialysis. Patients with a urea volume of distribution of 40 L would require 255 minutes of dialysis. Patients with a urea volume of distribution of 45 L would require over 270 minutes of dialysis. With a blood flow of 400 mL per minute, patients with a urea volume of distribution of 40 L could achieve the target single pool KtV of greater than 1.2 with 240 minutes of dialysis. Patients with a volume of distribution of 45 L could achieve the target with 270 minutes of dialysis. The authors did not model urea kinetics for patients with volumes of distribution greater than 45 L.31--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31 Leypoldt, J.K , Prichard, S., Chertow, G.M , amp Alvarez, L. 2019. Differential molecular modeling predictions of mid and conventional dialysate flows. Blood purification, 474, 369-376.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next, an article by Plumb, et al., described the Tablosupreg System IDE study discussed previously. Demographic information reflected the mean age as 52.3  11.6 years, 19 men and the following racial and ethnic representation 17 White, 13 Black or African American, 8 Hispanic or Latino, and 21 Not Hispanic or Latino. Comparisons among the 28 patients in this study and subsequent secondary analyses were either made between the 8 weeks of using the Tablosupreg System for in-center HD and the 8 weeks of the Tablosupreg System for in-home HD or between using the Tablosupreg System in-home HD and the treatment provided prior to study enrollment. In both settings, patients dialyzed using the Tablosupreg System 4 times per week. The primary efficacy endpoint was achievement of a weekly standard KtV greater than or equal to 2.1 in both the 8-week in-center phase of the study and the 8-week in-home phase of the study. This endpoint was achieved in 199 of 200 weeks in the in-center dialysis period and in 168 of 171 weeks in the in-home dialysis period. The primary safety endpoint of adverse event rates were similar at 1.9 percent in the in-center dialysis period and 1.8 percent in the in-home dialysis period. The secondary efficacy endpoint was whether the ultrafiltration volume and rate achieved the prescribed levels. In both in-center and in-home dialysis, 94 percent of treatments achieved successful delivery of ultrafiltration, defined as a rate within ten percent of the prescribed value. Of 960 in-center dialysis services and 896 in-home dialysis services, 922 and 884 were completed respectively, yielding adherence rates of 96 percent and 99 percent.32--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32 Safety and efficacy of the Tablo hemodialysis system for in-center and home hemodialysis Plumb, T.J , Alvarez, L., Ross, D.L , Lee, J.J , Mulhern, J.G , Bell, J.L , Abra, G., Prichard, S.S , Chertow, G.M and Aragon, M.A 2019, Hemodialysis International.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next, a separate article by Plumb et al., reported additional data from the Tablosupreg System IDE study previously discussed regarding participants assessment of the Tablosupreg Systems ease-of-use, the degree of dependence on health care workers and caregivers after training with the system was complete, and the training time required for a participant to be competent in self-care. Demographic information reflected the mean age as 52.6 years, 18 men, 10 women, 16 White, 7 Hispanic or Latino, 9 Not Hispanic or Latino, and 12 Black or African American. Participants were stratified according to whether they were previously on self-care dialysis at home or conventional in-center HD. Thirteen participants had previous experience performing self-care HD. The remaining 15 participants had previous experience with in-center HD only. All participants rated the Tablosupreg Systems setup, treatment, and takedown on a scale from 1 very difficult to 5 very simple and indicated whether they had required assistance with treatment over the prior 7 days. Set up times were similar regardless of whether the participants were previously on self-care HD or conventional in-center HD. For the participants previously on in-center HD, the average set up time for the concentrates was 0.93 minutes and for the cartridge, 9.35 minutes. For participants previously on self-care home HD, the average set up time for the concentrates was 1.22 minutes and for the cartridge, 10.28 minutes. The average rating of the Tablosupreg Systems ease of use for setup was 4.5, treatment 4.6, and take down 4.6 among the participants previously on self-care home HD. In comparison, based on recollection not based on rating during time of use these participants average rating of their previous devices ease of use for setup was 3.5, treatment 3.3, and take down 3.8 The average rating of the Tablosupreg Systems ease of use for setup and treatment was 4.6 and 4.7 for take down among participants without prior self-care experience. Among patients surveyed, caregiver assistance was required in 62 percent of patient-weeks during home self-care. Participants previously on self-care home HD required some caregiver assistance in 42 percent of the in-home dialysis treatment weeks. Participants previously on conventional in-center dialysis required some caregiver assistance in 35 percent of the in-home dialysis treatment weeks. The requirement for some form of assistance among participants with or without previous self-care experience was not meaningfully different. Finally, the authors noted that a protocol amendment allowed for the recording of the number of training sessions necessary to deem a patient competent to do self-care dialysis. This recording was limited to the last 15 participants enrolled into the study. Five of these participants had previous self-care dialysis at home experience. The average number of training sessions required to be deemed competent was 3.6 for participants with previous self-care dialysis at home experience and 3.9 sessions for participants with only conventional in-center HD experience.33--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 33 Plumb, Troy J., Luis Alvarez, Dennis L.

Hemodialysis International 2020.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next, a poster presentation from Chahal, et al., reported patient device preference of prior in-home HD patients based on data from the Tablosupreg System IDE study previously discussed. The authors noted that 13 of the 30 participants in the Tablosupreg System IDE trial were performing in-home HD at the time of enrollment and that prior to the study, dialysis prescriptions averaged 4.5 treatments per week with an average time of 3.1 hours per session. Trial prescriptions were for 4 days per week and an average of 3.4 hours per session. Adherence to the study regimen was 97 percent and 92 percent of surveys were completed. The authors concluded that participants with prior home HD experience preferred the Tablosupreg System compared to their prior device and 85.6 percent found that the Tablosupreg System was easier to use.34--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34 Chahal, Y., Plumb, T., Aragon M. 2020. Patient Device Preference for Home Hemodialysis A Subset Analysis of the Tablo Home IDE Trial. Poster Presentation at National Kidney Foundation Spring Clinical Conference, March 2020.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- As stated previously in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36337, the applicant submitted several sources pertaining to the incumbent, NxStagesupreg. First, an article from Kraus et al., described a feasibility study to demonstrate the safety of center-based versus home-based daily HD with the NxStagesupreg portable HD device. This retrospective analysis examined the extent to which clinical effectsPage 61894previously associated with short-daily dialysis were also seen using the NxStagesupreg device. The authors conducted a prospective, two-treatment, two-period, open-label, crossover study of in-center HD vs. home HD in 32 patients treated at six U.S centers. Demographic information reflected the mean age as 51 years, 63 percent male, 38 percent female, 24 White, 6 Black or African American, 1 American Indian or Alaskan native, and 1 Asian. The 8-week In-Center Phase 6 daysweek was followed by a 2-week transition period and then followed by the 8-week Home Phase 6 daysweek. Data was collected retrospectively on HD treatment parameters immediately preceding the study in a subset of patients. Twenty-six out of 32 patients 81 percent successfully completed the study. Treatment compliance defined as completing 43 to 48 treatments in a given phase was comparable between the 2 treatment environments 88 percent In-Center vs. 89 percent Home. Successful delivery of at least 90 percent of prescribed fluid volume primary endpoint was achieved in 98.5 percent of treatments in-center and 97.3 percent at home. Total effluent volume as a percentage of prescribed volume was between 94 percent and 100 percent for all study weeks. The composite rate of intradialytic and interdialytic adverse events per 100 treatments was significantly higher for the In-Center Phase 5.30 compared with the Home Phase 2.10 p0.007. Compared with the period immediately preceding the study, there were reductions in blood pressure, antihypertensive medications, and interdialytic weight gain. The study concluded that daily home HD with a small, easy-to-use HD device is a viable dialysis option for ESRD patients capable of selfpartner administered dialysis.35--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 35 Kraus, M., et al., A comparison of center-based vs. home-based daily hemodialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. Hemodialysis International, 11 468-477, 2007.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Second, an article from Finkelstein et al., reported on interim results of the Following Rehabilitation, Economics and Everyday-Dialysis Outcome Measurements FREEDOM study, a multi-center, prospective, cohort study of at-home short daily HD with a planned 12-month follow-up ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00288613. Eligible patients were adults with ESRD requiring dialysis who were being initiated on short daily HD prescribed 6 times per week at home using the NxStagesupreg cycler and who had Medicare as their primary insurance payer. The authors examined the long-term effect of short daily HD on health-related quality of life, as measured by the Short Form-36 SF-36 health survey. The survey was administered at baseline, 4 and 12 months after initiation of short daily HD to 291 total cohort participants. Demographic information reflected the mean age as 53 years, 66 percent male and 70 percent White. Of the 291 participants, 154 completed the 12-month follow-up as-treated cohort. In the total cohort analysis, both the physical- and mental-component summary scores improved over the 12-month period, as did all 8 individual domains of the SF-36. The as-treated cohort analysis showed similar improvements with the exception of the role-emotional domain. Significantly, in the as-treated cohort, the percentage of patients achieving a physical component summary score at least equivalent to the general population more than doubled. The authors concluded by noting that at-home short daily HD is associated with long-term improvements in various physical and mental health-related quality of life measures.36--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 36 Finkelstein, F.O , et al. 2012. At-home short daily hemodialysis improves the long-term health-related quality of life. Kidney International, 825, 561-569.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Third, in Weinhandl, et al., authors described a cohort study in which 4,201 new home HD patients in 2007 were matched with 4,201 new PD patients in 2010 from the United States Renal Data System USRDS database to assess relative mortality, hospitalization, and technique failure. Demographic information reflected the mean age as 53.8  14.9 years, 67 percent male, 33 percent female, 24.4 percent Black, and 75.6 percent Nonblack. Daily home HD patients initiated use of NxStagesupreg from 2007 through 2010. Authors reported home HD was associated with 20 percent lower risk for all-cause mortality, 8 percent lower risk for all-cause hospitalization, and 37 percent lower risk for technique failure, all relative to PD. Regarding hospitalization, risk comparisons favored home HD for cardiovascular disease and dialysis access infection and PD for bloodstream infection. Authors noted that matching was unlikely to reduce confounding attributable to unmeasured factors, including residual kidney function lack of data regarding dialysis frequency, duration, and dose in daily home HD patients and frequency and solution in PD patients and diagnosis codes used to classify admissions. The authors concluded that these data suggest that relative to PD, daily home HD is associated with decreased mortality, hospitalization, and technique failure but that risks for mortality and hospitalization were similar with these modalities in new dialysis patients.37--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 37 Weinhandl, E.D , Gilbertson, D.T , amp Collins, A.J 2016. Mortality, hospitalization, and technique failure in daily home hemodialysis and matched peritoneal dialysis patients a matched cohort study. American Journal of Kidney Diseases, 671, 98-110.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fourth, in Suri et al., 1116, daily home HD patients were matched by propensity scores to 2,784, contemporaneous USRDS patients receiving home PD. The authors compared hospitalization rates from cardiovascular, infectious, access-related or bleeding causes, and modality failure risk. Similar analyses were performed for 1,187, daily home HD patients matched to 3,173, USRDS patients receiving in-center conventional HD. Demographic information identified the mean age as 50.5 years, 67.3 percent male, 70.9 percent White, 26.6 percent Black, and 2.5 percent Other, among the daily home HD patients. Among the home PD patients, the mean age was identified as 50.9 years, 66.9 percent male, 73.1 percent White, 25.1 percent Black and 1.2 percent Other. The composite hospitalization rate was significantly lower with daily home HD than with PD 0.93 vs. 1.35patient-year. Daily home HD patients spent significantly fewer days in the hospital than PD patients 5.2 vs. 9.2 dayspatient-year, and significantly more daily home HD patients remained admission-free 52 percent daily home dialysis vs. 32 percent PD. In contrast, there was no significant difference in hospitalizations between daily home HD and conventional HD 0.93 vs. 1.10patient-year. Cardiovascular hospitalizations were lower with daily home HD than with conventional HD 0.68 while infectious and access hospitalizations were higher 1.15 and 1.25 respectively. Significantly more PD than daily home HD patients switched back to in-center HD 44 percent vs. 15 percent. In this prevalent cohort, daily home HD was associated with fewer admissions and hospital days than PD, and a substantially lower risk of modality failure.38--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38 Suri, R.S , Li, L., amp Nesrallah, G.E 2015.

Kidney International, 882, 360-368.---------------------------------------------------------------------------b Applicant Substantial Clinical Improvement Claims Regarding the applicants first claim that the Tablosupreg System decreases treatment frequency with adequatePage 61895dialysis clearance, the applicant stated that the Tablosupreg System is the only mobile HD device approved for use in the home that can achieve adequate dialysis in as little as 3 treatments per week, while also providing flexibility for more frequent dialysis and thus greater personalization of care. The applicant stated that adequate dialysis for a standard, thrice-weekly treatment schedule is a single treatment clearance of urea, expressed as a single-pool KtV spKtV of greater than 1.2 where K  dialyzer clearance, t  time, and V  Volume of distribution of urea. The applicant also stated that dialyzer clearance, or K, is dependent on the mass transfer coefficient KoA characteristics of the prescribed dialyzer and prescribed blood and dialysate flow rates. The applicant further noted that limitations in K or t affect the ability of a patient to achieve adequate clearance during a dialysis treatment. Per the applicant, across a broad range of weights, patients using the Tablosupreg System can achieve the target of dialysis adequacy, a single pool KtV of 1.2, with 3 treatments per week in less than 4 hours.39 The applicant also stated that when used 4 times per week, patients using the Tablosupreg System had a higher mean weekly standard KtV with equivalent or better dialysis-related hospitalization rates,40 as compared to NxStagesupreg IDE patients prescribed therapy at 6 days per week.41--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39 Alvarez, Luis et al.

Safety and efficacy of the Tablo hemodialysis system for in-center and home hemodialysis. Hemodialysis International. 41 NxStage Clearance Calculator. Available at Accessed on Jan 21, 2021.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant stated that the Tablosupreg Systems on-demand dialysate production has no limitation to the volume of dialysate that can be produced and used during a single treatment. The applicant further stated that this facilitates the delivery of adequate dialysis clearance KtV in a standard duration and target frequency of 3 times per week, as well as alternate frequencies and durations as preferred by a patient or recommended by a health care provider. The applicant asserted that NxStage,supreg when attached to its PureFlowTM device, requires users to batch a set amount of dialysate maximum of 60 liters in advance of a treatment or use sterile dialysate bags maximum of 30 liters. The applicant also stated that at its maximum dialysate flow rate Qd of 300mlmin, NxStagesupreg greatly limits time by restricting treatment to a maximum of 200 minutes before exhausting its dialysate capacity 200 min  60L300mlmin. The applicant stated that Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study DOPPS data demonstrate that the current U.S practice for thrice-weekly dialysis occurs at an average treatment time of greater than 220 minutes, and has increased in the last 25 years.42 Per the applicant, with the limited t, a single-pooled KtV of gt1.2 cannot be expected to be achieved for the majority of U.S patients with ESRD on a thrice-weekly schedule, requiring increased treatment frequency 43 at home for these patients to meet the desired clearance level.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42 Tentori F, Zhang J, Li Y, Karaboyas A, Kerr P, Saran R, Bommer J, Port F, Akiba T, Pisoni R, Robinson B.

PMID 22431708 PMCID PMC3529546. 43 Health Management Associates HMA analysis of 2018 100 Medicare Outpatient file.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- In citing Leypoldt, et al., the applicant stated that data from the Hemodialysis HEMO trial combined with modeling results from Leypoldt, et al.,44 allowed for an estimation of the patients with ESRD, based on weight, that cannot be expected to achieve target clearance with standard thrice-weekly dialysis at this treatment duration. The applicant explained that because urea is evenly distributed throughout a bodys water, the volume of distribution of urea is equal to a patients total volume of water. The applicant also stated that total body water and volume of distribution of urea can be expressed as a volume or as a percentage of total weight and can vary based on numerous factors including disease state. The applicant stated that it is possible to estimate the percent of water for the ESRD population from the HEMO trial as summarized in Leypoldt et al.45 The applicant stated that in the trial, the mean patient weight was 69.8kg and the mean patient volume of body water V was 30.9L The applicant further explained that from this, total body water and volume of distribution of urea were calculated as 44.3 percent of the mean weight of patients with ESRD 44.3  30.9L69.8kg x 100. Per the applicant, applying this 44.3 percent of total body weight to the volumes of distribution in Leypoldt et al.46 allowed for the conversion of the kinetic model described into anticipated patient weights. The applicant further stated that in calculating with standard blood flow and a higher dialyzer mass transfer area coefficient for urea KoA dialyzer, a 200 minute treatment at a dialysate flow rate Qd of 300mlmin would not achieve what the applicant refers to as the CMS target spKtV target 1.2 for patients with a volume of distribution of urea V of 35L or greater. The applicant stated that these assumptions were drawn from NxStagesupreg technical specifications.47 48 The applicant stated that at 44.3 percent of total weight, this volume of distribution of urea correlated to patients with ESRD with a mean weight above 79 kg 79  35L.443 or approximately 174 pounds. Per the applicant, patients at or above this weight cannot be expected to achieve a spKtV urea of 1.2 on a thrice-weekly schedule using the NxStagesupreg system at its maximal dialysate flow rate.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 44 Leypoldt, J.K , Prichard, S., Chertow, G.M , amp Alvarez, L. 2019.

Kidney Int. 641108-1119.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant stated that for the majority of the U.S prevalent ESRD population between the ages of 22-74, whose mean weight is between 84.3-89.1 kg by age group,49 thrice-weekly therapy at home on NxStagesupreg would not achieve the Medicare coverage standard. Specifically, per the applicant, Medicares national coverage policy is to reimburse for dialysis care 3 times per week, regardless of the modality that is used, and health care providers are expected to ensure that patients receive adequate clearance with the 3 times per week cadence. The applicant also stated that MACs have discretion in reimbursing additional treatments with medical justification.50 Per the applicant, an analysis of MedicarePage 61896claims data from 2018 found that despite the limitations of the reimbursement policy, Medicare paid for 5 or more treatments per week in 50 percent of home HD patients nationwide, amounting to an estimated annual cost to Medicare of 122 to 126 million.51 However, as we stated in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36339, based on CMS review of dialysis facility claims data, among all beneficiaries who had home dialysis treatments in 2018, 39.1 percent had 5 or more dialysis sessions at least once during any week. The overall percentage of beneficiary-weeks that had 5 or more home HD sessions in 2018 was 20.9 percent. Medicare payment for these additional sessions totaled 17 million. We noted that, as indicated in Local Coverage Determination ID L35014, Frequency of Dialysis revised effective September 26, 2019,52 CMS established payment for HD based on conventional treatment which is defined as 3 times per week. Sessions in excess of 3 times per week must be both reasonable and necessary in order to receive payment. Covered indications include metabolic conditions acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, fluid positive status not controlled with routine dialysis, pregnancy, heart failure, pericarditis, and incomplete dialysis secondary to hypotension or access issues. The applicant asserted that the use of the Tablosupreg System would decrease the number of necessary dialysis treatments, without affecting patient outcomes such as clearance or hospitalizations.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 49 United States Renal Data System. 2020 USRDS Annual Data Report Epidemiology of kidney disease in the United States, End-Stage Renal Disease Chapter 2.

Retrieved May 24, 2021 from The applicant stated that there was clinical evidence and expert consensus that as treatment frequency increases, native residual kidney function drops, patient and care partner burden increases, and vascular access complications increase.53 54 Per the applicant, home use of the Tablosupreg System could reduce the need for a fifth or sixth weekly treatment without increasing patients symptom burden.55 The applicant stated that by achieving adequacy targets with fewer treatments, Tablosupreg System patients could be expected to have fewer vascular access interventions and health care providers will have increased flexibility in personalizing the frequency and duration of patient treatments.56 57 The applicant stated that reducing treatment frequency while maintaining adequate patient clearance levels may also reduce complications that lead to hospitalizations. The applicant stated that during the Tablosupreg System IDE study, patients using the Tablosupreg System 4 times per week, for an average duration of less than 4 hours per treatment, had an all-cause hospital admission rate of 426 per 1,000 patient-years whereas in the general dialysis population, the all-cause admission rate was 1,688 per 1,000 patient-years, and for patients who utilized PD, the hospitalization rate was 1,460 per 1,000 patient years.58--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53 National Kidney Foundation.

Available at Reference Table G2.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant stated that while NxStagesupreg has not specifically reported the hospitalization rates per patient-year from its IDE study, published data from Weinhandl et al.,59 and Suri et al.,60 reported hospital admission rates amongst patients on daily home HD ranging from 930 to 1,663 per 1,000 patient-years, using a national sample of dialysis patients matched for comparison to similar peritoneal and in-center dialysis patients. We clarified in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36339-36340 that this would represent 930 to 1,663 cases observed among 1,000 persons during 1 year. The applicant also noted that all data on home patients in Weinhandl et al. came from a matched cohort of NxStagesupreg patients. Per the applicant, in Suri et al., data were collected prior to 2015 and that during this timeframe, it could be reasonably assumed that home HD patients were using NxStagesupreg for treatment. The applicant stated that the results from these studies suggested that patients receiving treatment at home with NxStagesupreg 5 to 6 times per week do not have a lower all-cause hospitalization rate, relative to matched in-center HD patients. The applicant concluded by stating that because of the clinical and demographic diversity of the Tablosupreg Systems patient population, the applicants results showed incremental improvement over the hospitalization rate of the current home HD population.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59 Weinhandl, E.D , Gilbertson, D.T , amp Collins, A.J 2016.

The applicant further stated that this increased adherence and retention is likely to improve patient outcomes by reducing the rate of dialysis-related hospitalizations and other adverse events associated with missing treatment in this patient population.61--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 61 Chan, K.E , Thadhani, R.I , amp Maddux, F.W 2014.

Supporting evidence of association between decreased dialysis adherence and poor patient health and utilization outcomes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant stated that adherence to prescribed dialysis treatments is crucial for dialysis patients because missed treatments increased the risk of dialysis dropout, hospitalization, and death.62 Per the applicant, the Tablosupreg System IDE study demonstrated a 99 percent treatment adherence rate to allPage 61897prescribed home treatments 63 among both prior in-center participants and prior self-care home HD participants who used NxStagesupreg. The applicant also stated that the Tablosupreg Systems adherence rates were similar among both the prior in-center and prior self-care participants. The applicant stated that these results represent a significant improvement over the treatment adherence rate reported in the NxStagesupreg IDE, where the treatment compliance rate was defined less stringently as missing 5 or fewer treatments of the 48 possible treatments and was only 89 percent among patients at home and during the study period.64 Per the applicant, using a comparable metric of missing 5 or fewer of all possible treatments at home, Tablosupreg System IDE patients at home had a 100 percent treatment compliance rate.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 62 Weinhandl, Eric D., Collins Allan, Incidence of Therapy Cessation among Home Hemodialysis Patients in the United States, Abstract presented, American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2016. 63 Safety and efficacy of the Tablo hemodialysis system for in-center and home hemodialysis Plumb, T.J , Alvarez, L., Ross, D.L , Lee, J.J , Mulhern, J.G , Bell, J.L , Abra, G., Prichard, S.S , Chertow, G.M and Aragon, M.A 2019, Hemodialysis International. 64 Kraus, M., et al.

The authors performed a feasibility study to demonstrate the safety of center-based vs. home-based daily hemodialysis with the NxStage System One portable hemodialysis device.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant stated that technique failure in home HD, defined as reduced retention at home and a return to in-center care, has been high with NxStagesupreg. Per the applicant, real world data show that technique failure occurs in 36 percent of home HD patients using NxStagesupreg within 1 year of initiating treatment.65 The applicant stated that this was challenging for the patient and taxing on the healthcare system that had invested in providing patients with home dialysis training and in paying for more frequent therapy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 65 Weinhandl, Eric D., Collins Allan, Incidence of Therapy Cessation among Home Hemodialysis Patients in the United States, Abstract presented, American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2016.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant stated that by directly comparing the Tablosupreg Systems retention to that of NxStagesupreg, the applicant assessed rates in the analogous IDE populations while excluding those who exited either study for reasons unrelated to the device such as receipt of a transplant or death. The applicant stated that the Tablosupreg System demonstrated a 97 percent 28 of 29 patient retention rate for the entire IDE study and a 100 percent retention rate in the in-home phase of the trial among both prior NxStagesupreg users and prior in-center patients.66 The applicant stated that in comparison, 81 percent of participants completed the NxStagesupreg IDE study.67--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 66 Safety and efficacy of the Tablo hemodialysis system for in-center and home hemodialysis Plumb, T.J , Alvarez, L., Ross, D.L , Lee, J.J , Mulhern, J.G , Bell, J.L , Abra, G., Prichard, S.S , Chertow, G.M and Aragon, M.A 2019, Hemodialysis International. 67 Kraus M, Burkart J, Hegeman R, Solomon R, Coplon N, Moran J.

The applicant stated that, in comparison, device-related training time is reduced by at least 50 percent on the Tablosupreg System. Per the applicant, the reduced training time and ease of use would likely improve retention and potentially reduce the number of reimbursable training sessions. The applicant stated that because of the significant role that caregivers play in supporting home dialysis treatments,70 care partner burnout and a patients perception of being a burden is associated with discontinuation of home therapy.71 72--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 68 Plumb, Troy J., Luis Alvarez, Dennis L.

The applicant stated that a 96 percent response rate 216 of 224 possible was achieved at the end of the study and that for both prior-in-center and NxStagesupreg study participants, in 79 percent of the treatment weeks, patients reported needing no assistance from their care partner in performing dialysis set-up, treatment, or breakdown. The applicant explained that among the 13 prior in-home patients, all of whom were formerly NxStagesupreg users, participants reported needing help from a trained individual with dialysis treatment in 69 percent of treatment weeks, with 46 percent of instances involving a need for device-related help. We clarified in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36340--36341 that per Plumb, et al.,73 this was the baseline percentage and reflected 9 of the 13 patients with previous self-care experience. The applicant stated that patients reported needing help with treatment in only 42 percent of treatment weeks while using the Tablosupreg System, which was a 39 percent reduction from baseline NxStagesupreg use and only 18 percent of these instances related to use of the Tablosupreg System, which was a 61 percent reduction in rate from baseline NxStagesupreg use.74--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 73 Plumb, Troy J., Luis Alvarez, Dennis L.

Hemodialysis International 2020. 74 Ibid.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant stated that it collected weekly data from patients by asking them to rate the extent to which they believed that they were a burden on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 representing never and 5 representing always. The applicant stated that this measure was adapted from an instrument used in assessing terminally ill patients.75 The applicant stated that the subpopulation of study participants who had previously used NxStagesupreg reported an average score of 3.1 for self-perceived burden on their care partner when using their prior device, which subsequently reduced to 2.4 when using the Tablosupreg System a 23 percent reduction in score from baseline NxStagesupreg use.76 Per the applicant, these data underscored that a significant increase in patients confidence, ability to achieve treatment independence at home, and subsequent reduction in the sense of self burden can positively contributed to success in the home setting. The applicant further noted that the ease of use, reduced training time, and substantial reduction in care partner assistance required forPage 61898the Tablosupreg System correlated to the improved retention and adherence rates in the Tablosupreg System IDE study. The applicant stated that on a population level, this likely translated to reduced barriers to continuing home HD once initiated, and ultimately, a reduced risk of adverse outcomes due to missed treatments. The applicant also stated that the Tablosupreg Systems electronic data capture and automatic wireless transmission eliminates the need for manual record keeping, which represented an improvement with respect to burden and monitoring as compared to NxStagesupreg.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 75 Chochinov, H.M , Kristjanson, L.J , Hack, T.F , Hassard, T., McClement, S., amp Harlos, M. 2007.

Per the applicant, patients with ESRD experience significant dialysis-related symptoms including difficulty sleeping, dizziness, and pain associated with recovery time that affect mental and physical health and lead to decreased overall quality of life.77 Per the applicant, the Tablosupreg System IDE study assessed several validated Patient-Reported Outcome Measures PROMs to better understand overall health-related quality of life HR-QoL. The applicant explained that the overall measure was the EQ-5D-5L, a validated, preference-based PROM in which patients self-assess mobility, self-care, usual activities, paindiscomfort, and anxietydepression.78 The applicant stated that from these domains, an index value is calculated to report a summary score that ranges from 0 death to 1 full health.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 77 Gabbay, E., Meyer, K.B , Griffith, J.L , Richardson, M.M , amp Miskulin, D.C 2010.

The European Journal of Health Economics, 208, 1195-1206.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Per the applicant, while the NxStagesupreg IDE study did not report results for a quality-of-life instrument, HR-QoL was assessed in NxStagesupreg patients in a prospective multicenter observational study referred to as the FREEDOM trial, which examined the effects of at-home dialysis 6 times per week with the NxStagesupreg System on costs and HR-QoL using the SF-36 instrument. The applicant further stated that the reported results at 4-month follow-up among these patients 79 translates to a mean EQ-5D score of 0.70 The applicant included an appendix describing the Methodology to Derive EQ-5D Scores from the FREEDOM Study Results in its application and derived a predicted mean EQ-5D score of 0.695-0.70 at follow up for the FREEDOM study. The applicant further noted that because this estimate is based on the average aggregate change for an adjusted measure that was then translated to the EQ-5D scale, and the applicant did not have access to standard error estimates for the Mental Component Score MCS and Physical Component Score PCS, its interpretation of this estimate and its variance is limited. Per the applicant, nonetheless, it provided a sense of the comparable HR-QoL of this sample of NxStagesupreg patients at follow-up. The applicant further noted that mean EQ-5D index values for traditional HD and PD patients reported from a meta-analysis of existing studies in the literature are 0.56 95 percent CI 0.49-0.62 and 0.58 95 percent CI 0.5-0.67, respectively.80--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79 Finkelstein, F.O , et al. 2012.

The applicant stated that this is a significant improvement when using traditional HD patients as a comparator, and higher overall HR-QoL as compared to NxStagesupreg patients. The applicant emphasized that participants in the Tablosupreg System IDE trial underwent a reduced treatment frequency as compared to participants in the FREEDOM study who were prescribed 6 treatments per week on NxStagesupreg. The applicant stated that among patients in the Tablosupreg System IDE study who had previously been using NxStagesupreg, the mean EQ-5D score during the in-home phase of the study was 0.906 SD 0.119 and asserted that this is significantly greater than index population values for HD and PD.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 81 Chertow, G.M , Alvarez, L., Plumb, T.J , Prichard, S.S , amp Aragon, M. 2020.

The applicant stated that, in the absence of a well-validated sleep survey specific to the ESRD population, study investigators selected survey questions from previously validated sleep questionnaires in the non-ESRD population, based on their relevance to the study population.84 85 The applicant explained that questions were designed to focus on quality of sleep and restfulness and noted that these measures are validated for use among chronically ill populations and measure the frequency of 4 key sleep-related symptoms. The applicant stated that, while at home, patients on the Tablosupreg System reported improved quality of sleep, with a measurable reduction in rate of patient-reported sleep symptoms ranging from a 10-60 percent reduction, depending on symptom.86 The applicant stated that this reduction was observed among study participants who were previously receiving dialysis in-center average magnitude of reduction in rate across symptoms 42 percent and among study participants who were previously receiving in-home dialysis on NxStagesupreg average magnitude of reduction in rate across symptoms 27 percent. Per the applicant, on average, sleep-related difficulties reduced from being reported in 33 percent of treatment weeks while on NxStagesupreg to 23 percent of treatment weeks while on the Tablosupreg System.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82 Davison SN, Levin A, Moss AH, Jha V, Brown EA, Brennan F, Murtagh FE, Naicker S, Germain MJ, ODonoghue DJ, Morton RL, Obrador GT Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes.

The applicant also stated that at the end of each study treatment, participants were surveyed regarding the presence of any symptoms during that treatment on the Tablosupreg System. Per the applicant, a total of 8 26.7 percent subjects reported hypotensive symptoms during the Tablosupreg System treatments during the in-home treatment period, compared to 27 90 percent subjects reporting hypotensive symptoms at baseline prior to initiating care on the Tablosupreg System. The applicant reported a 70 percent reduction in the rate of patient-reported hypotensive symptoms while on the Tablosupreg System, though, as we stated in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36342, we were unable to validate the source of this statement.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 87 Urquhart-Secord, Rachel et al 2016.

The applicant also stated that patient preference for devices is currently used by FDA to guide marketing authorization decisions and provides important information on the benefit and risks that some patients are willing to trade when choosing a device.90 Per the applicant, patients may be more likely to choose home dialysis to the extent that the device is both accessible and easy to use. The applicant also stated that 86 percent of prior NxStagesupreg patients in the Tablosupreg System IDE study found the Tablosupreg System easier to use than their incumbent device and preferred to remain on the Tablosupreg System at the end of the study.91--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90 Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health 2020.

Patient Device Preference for Home Hemodialysis A Subset Analysis of the Tablo Home IDE Trial. Poster Presentation at National Kidney Foundation Spring Clinical Conference, March 2020.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- In summary, the applicant claimed that the Tablosupreg System improves the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries relative to the incumbent by focusing on outcomes set forth in Sec. 412.87b1iiC, including a decreased number of treatments to achieve dialysis adequacy, which the applicant stated leads to greater adherence to prescribed therapy, and improved quality of life.c CMS Assessment of Substantial Clinical Improvement Claims and Sources As discussed in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36342, after a review of the information provided by the applicant, we had identified the following preliminary concerns regarding the substantial clinical improvement eligibility criterion for the TPNIES. We noted that, consistent with Sec. 413.236c, CMS would announce its final determination regarding whether the Tablosupreg System meets the substantial clinical improvement criterion and other eligibility criteria for the TPNIES in this CY 2022 ESRD PPS final rule. With respect to the applicants claim that patients can achieve dialysis adequacy in as little as 3 treatments per week, we noted that the Tablosupreg System IDE study did not test whether patients receive adequate dialysis on a thrice-weekly schedule. Instead, data published from the Tablosupreg System IDE study addressed a weekly measure of dialysis adequacy among patients treated on a 4 times per week schedule. The applicant relied on modeling and unpublished data on patients receiving thrice-weekly dialysis in making the conclusion that dialysis adequacy can be reached on a thrice-weekly schedule. Specifically, the applicant referred to a theoretical modeling study based on historical data from the USRDS, Medicare claims, and historical outcomes from NxStagesupreg observational studies. The applicant also stated that findings from a retrospective review of 29 patients receiving treatment with the Tablosupreg System on a thrice-weekly schedule affirmed the results from the modeling study. We also noted that the authors in Alvarez et al.92 stated that conclusions about fluid removal could not be made from their study.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92 Alvarez, Luis et al. Urea Clearance Results in Patients Dialyzed Thrice-weekly Using a Dialysate Flow of 300 mLmin, clinical abstract, presented March 2019, Annual Dialysis Conference, Dallas, Texas.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- We stated that we were interested in whether additional studies were available that address issues related to effective fluid removal using home self-care dialysis thrice-weekly with the Tablosupreg System. We invited comments on whether less frequent dialysis sessions would represent substantial clinical improvement over shorter, more frequent sessions that, according to the applicant, were common among users of the incumbent technology. The applicants second claim was that the Tablosupreg System increased adherence to dialysis treatment and retention to home therapy, which may reduce dialysis-related hospitalizations and other adverse events associated with missing treatment. This claim was supported by the Tablosupreg System IDE study 28 participants completed the study and the use of historical comparisons to prior studies involving the NxStagesupreg System. The applicant noted that hospitalization rates from the Tablosupreg System IDE trial were lower than rates in the general dialysis population and rates reported in two observational studies of patients using the NxStagesupreg device. While the applicant cited an all-cause hospitalization rate of 426 per 1000 patient years in the Tablosupreg System IDE study, we pointed out in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule that it did not appear that the sources 93 94 published these hospitalization rates. We further noted that the applicant relied on historical comparisons in asserting that that patients treated with the Tablosupreg System experience reducedPage 61900disease burden and improved quality of life.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93 Safety and efficacy of the Tablo hemodialysis system for in-center and home hemodialysis Plumb, T.J , Alvarez, L., Ross, D.L , Lee, J.J , Mulhern, J.G , Bell, J.L , Abra, G., Prichard, S.S , Chertow, G.M and Aragon, M.A 2019, Hemodialysis International. 94 Chertow, G.M , Alvarez, L., Plumb, T.J , Prichard, S.S , amp Aragon, M. 2020. Patient-reported outcomes from the investigational device exemption study of the Tablo hemodialysis system. Hemodialysis International, 244, 480-486.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- We noted in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36343 that in the Tablosupreg System IDE study, the before-after comparisons in patients with NxStagesupreg regarding improved sleep compared to prior to the Tablosupreg System may be prone to recall bias in that participants experiences with NxStagesupreg were not recorded at the time they were receiving NxStagesupreg treatments, but rather, were based on recall at the time of the Tablosupreg System IDE study. We stated that we understood that greater flexibility for patients in the way that they receive their dialysis treatments may represent a benefit to Medicare beneficiaries who are candidates to receive this treatment in the home setting. We invited comments on whether this potential benefit represents substantial clinical improvement, including whether the Tablosupreg System represented an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. We received multiple comments on the substantial clinical improvement claims made in the TPNIES application for the Tablosupreg System, ranging from commenters with concerns about the claims, including from a manufacturer of a competitor device, to comments in support of the application, including from the applicant. The comments on the three substantial clinical improvement claims made by the applicant, and our responses to the comments, are set forth below. Comment A commenter, a manufacturer of a competitor device, asserted that the Tablosupreg System does not meet the substantial clinical improvement criterion. The commenter asserted that the applicants claims were not supported by robust clinical evidence. The commenter made several criticisms about the Tablosupreg System IDE trial and the other clinical evidence provided by the applicant, emphasizing the lack of a direct head-to-head comparison with the NxStagesupreg device as well as relying on theoretical modeling. For example, the commenter stated that the applicant did not submit adequate evidence to demonstrate its first claim, that decreased home HD treatment frequency with the Tablosupreg System offered a substantial clinical benefit for home HD patients, because the applicants study examined patients that dialyzed on the Tablosupreg System more than three times per week and did not compare the Tablosupreg System machine to the NxStagesupreg machine, which the commenter claimed is also capable of thrice-weekly dialysis. Further, the commenter stated that current models of the NxStagesupreg System OneTM offer dialysate flow rates of 300mlminute and NxStagesupreg patients can currently dialyze with any amount of dialysate prescribed by their doctor. The commenter asserted that the NxStagesupreg machine is more flexible than the Tablosupreg System and that other incumbent systems, such as the Fresenius 2008KhomeTM, are capable of even more urea clearance than the Tablosupreg System in the same amount of time. Even though the commenter stated that patients using other home HD machines are able to achieve dialysis adequacy on a thrice-weekly dialysis schedule, the commenter also stated that it was not aware of any additional data in support of adequate fluid removal using a thrice-weekly dialysis schedule with the Tablosupreg System. The commenter also expressed concerns with the applicants claim that less frequent dialysis sessions may represent substantial clinical improvement over shorter, more frequent sessions because certain clinical and quality of life advancements, like more energy and vitality, are closely linked to more frequent treatments, which more closely mirror the natural function of a patients kidney. This same point was also raised by other commenters, including health care providers. These other commenters also expressed a preference for more frequent dialysis stating that it results in increased energy levels, improved sleep and mental health, and that patients undergoing more frequent dialysis need fewer dietary restrictions and antihypertensive and phosphate binder medications. Additionally, the commenter stated that evidence suggests there is no disadvantage in access complications for patients that undergo more frequent dialysis, while also noting that the applicant did not present studies that compared vascular access with the Tablosupreg System to NxStagesupreg. The commenter stated that the applicant did not provide sufficient clinical evidence for its claim that the Tablosupreg System results in an incremental improvement in hospitalization rates because the sources that the applicant provided were not yet published. Similarly, the commenter asserted that the applicant did not demonstrate that the Tablosupreg System increases adherence to the dialysis treatment and retention to home therapy because the studies cited by the applicant did not compare adherence, retention, or ease of use for the Tablosupreg System with the NxStagesupreg or the Fresenius 2008KhomeTM systems. The commenter stated that the Tablosupreg System IDE study on which the applicant relied to demonstrate treatment adherence and retention had several weaknesses including a small patient population, narrow patient inclusion criteria, and short duration. While the commenter acknowledged that the applicant did compare adherence rates from the Tablosupreg System IDE Study to adherence in the NxStagesupreg IDE study, the commenter explained that this methodology was not appropriate because the studies had different definitions of treatment compliance. The commenter noted that the applicants comparison of patient retention rates from the Tablosupreg System and NxStagesupreg IDE studies was similarly not appropriate because the equipment used during the time of the NxStagesupreg IDE study was completely different from that which is widely used today that is, NxStagesupreg touchscreen VersiHDTM, Express Warmer, PureFlowTM SL. Also, regarding the applicants adherence claim, the commenter identified several factors that it argued may reduce dialysis adherence using the Tablosupreg System and restrict its use to a small subset of dialysis patients. First, the commenter stated that patients without consistent access to clean tap water may be at risk for disruptions in dialysis treatment with the Tablosupreg System. The commenter identified potential tap water disruptions such as water main breaks or the loss tap water during power outages for patients who rely on well-based water. The commenter further stated that water source disruptions do not hinder NxStagesupreg patients from continuing their treatment because they can treat with pre-mixed dialysate bags. The commenter concluded that the Tablosupreg Systems on-demand dialysate production is not a substantial clinical improvement over the NxStagesupreg System OneTM with PureFlowTM SLs on-site dialysate production. Second, the commenter stated, as did several other commenters, that the Tablosupreg System increases electric and water utility expenses by requiring a large volume of water to complete the reverse osmosis process and because the system must heat the water prior to use for dialysate and for sterilization after treatment. Third, the commenter stated that the Tablosupreg System has not received FDA marketing authorization for solo home hemodialysis hemodialysis without a care partner during waking hours, as well as nocturnal home hemodialysis, whereas the NxStagesupreg System OneTM has received these FDA marketing authorizations.Page 61901 The commenter stated that the applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to advance its claim that the Tablosupreg System improves patient quality of life. The commenter stated that no comparison of incremental benefit in quality of life of the Tablosupreg System over NxStagesupreg was provided. The commenter further stated that studies involving hundreds of patients have been specifically designed to test quality of life outcomes, among NxStagesupreg users and have been published in peer-reviewed journals demonstrating quality of life improvements among NxStagesupreg users. The commenter stated that there is a high bar for relying on quality of life evidence to demonstrate innovation, recognizing the breadth of evidence that exists for current technologies. Regarding the applicants evidence on its improved patient quality of life claim, the commenter stated that it was unable to confirm the applicants claim of a 70 percent reduction in the rate of patient-reported hypotensive symptoms while on the Tablosupreg System and asserted that data also supports a reduction in intradialytic hypotensive episodes among NxStagesupreg patients, referring to an article by Murashima et al.95--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95 Murashima M, Kumar D, Doyle AM, Glickman JD. Comparison of intradialytic blood pressure variability between conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis and short daily hemodialysis. Hemodial Int. 2010 Jul143270-7. doi 10.1111j.1542-4758.2010.00438.x PMID 20337744.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The commenter similarly questioned the applicants claims regarding sleep quality and related symptoms stating that the Tablosupreg System IDE data did not compare the Tablosupreg System to NxStage, relied on a small sample size, was of short duration, and was not accurate because study results may have been affected by recall bias. Regarding the recall bias concern, additional commenters also wrote in with concurring comments. These commenters explained that participants experiences with NxStagesupreg were not recorded at the time they were receiving NxStagesupreg treatments, but rather, were based on recall at the time of the Tablosupreg System IDE study. Regarding the applicants claim that the Tablosupreg System users spend less time in training compared to existing technologies, the commenter questioned the applicants reference to 14.5 days to complete training on NxStage, stating that this timeframe includes training about aspects of home dialysis beyond the functionality of the machine. The commenter stated that only approximately 5 session-equivalents are machine-focused during training with NxStagesupreg. The commenter also stated that because 13 patients in the Tablosupreg System IDE study had previous home HD experience, the study participants would have already been trained on the most difficult aspects of home therapy, such as self-cannulation. Therefore, the commenter suggested review of a larger number of patients who are truly new to home therapy. The commenter rejected the applicants assertions that the Tablosupreg Systems features are unique and stated that the applicant did not submit data demonstrating that the Tablosupreg System is easier to use than other devices. The commenter stated its belief that many aspects of the Tablosupreg System are more difficult to use than NxStagesupreg and highlighted key features that have become available since publication of the NxStagesupreg IDE study. The commenter also challenged the applicants description of the Tablosupreg Systems cartridge as being pre-strung compared to existing cartridges and stated that NxStagesupreg offers a cartridge that requires 4 fewer blood tubing connections. The commenter also stated that NxStagesupreg systems are the only home HD systems approved for self-treatment without a care partner, addressing partner fatigue. The commenter and several members of the public identified the ability to travel as a quality of life issue. They stated that because the Tablosupreg System weighs nearly 200 pounds, it is not portable, while the NxStagesupreg device is lighter and portable. Due to its portability, the competitor commenter added that 70 percent of NxStagesupreg users reported traveling while using the machine. Finally, this commenter stated that while certain patients may prefer certain features of the Tablosupreg System, the presence of an additional option for home dialysis machine does not in itself represent a clinical improvement. Response We appreciate the input provided by the commenters. We have taken this information into consideration in our determination of whether the Tablosupreg System meets the eligibility criteria at Sec. 413.236b5 and Sec. 412.87b1, and have responded in further detail to comments discussing the significant clinical improvement claims for the Tablosupreg System at the end of this section of the final rule. Comment We received a comment from the applicant in support of the TPNIES approval for the Tablosupreg System. With respect to the claim that patients can achieve dialysis adequacy in as little as three treatments per week and the concern we expressed in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule that the Tablosupreg System IDE study did not test whether patients receive adequate dialysis on a thrice-weekly schedule, the applicant clarified that the intent was not to position three times per week home dialysis as substantial clinical improvement over short daily or more frequent dialysis. Instead, their claim is that more frequent dialysis, which they believe is a requirement for NxStage, is significantly more burdensome for patients with ESRD for whom thrice-weekly treatments may be appropriate. The applicant stated that the Tablosupreg Systems ability to achieve KtV targets of 1.2 on a thrice-weekly treatment schedule at home represents substantial clinical improvement because they believe it allows patients the benefits of home dialysis whether administered three or four times per week, which had not been an option previously because of the technical limitations of the NxStagesupreg system. Specifically, per the applicant, on a standard treatment duration, three day per week schedule patients with weights above 79kg do not have sufficient dialysate with NxStagesupreg maximum of 60L to achieve the CMS mandated target without increasing the amount of time per treatment that the patient has to dialyze. The applicant further stated that the Tablosupreg System can achieve levels of efficiency nearly on par with in-center hemodialysis on conventional hardware. The applicant also noted that patients treated with NxStagesupreg would exhaust its dialysate at 3 hours 20 minutes at an equivalent dialysate flow rate of 300mlmin. In support of that claim, the applicant referred to kinetic modeling, the clearance kinetics of the NxStagesupreg dialyzer, and the percentage of body water 96 97 in patients weighing 174 pounds or greater. The applicant concluded that patients treated with NxStagesupreg would require greater than thrice-weekly treatments to achieve hemodialysis adequacy with spKtV of gt1.2 The applicant stated that because the Tablosupreg System is able to generate dialysate on demand at 300mlmin for up to 12 hours without volume limitations, it allows patients the flexibility to adequately dialyze at the frequency that is best for them ratherPage 61902than requiring them to perform more frequent treatments.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 96 Leypoldt, J.

Am J Kidney Dis. 1999 Jan331142-9.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant stated that their evidence on achieving KtV of 1.2 on a conventional three times per week dialysis schedule came from an observational study conducted on an in-center patient population using the Tablosupreg System prior to its FDA marketing authorization for home HD. The applicant referred to abstracts presented at the 2019 Annual Dialysis Conference as summarized in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule. The applicant emphasized that evidence from published and unpublished sources may be sufficient in establishing substantial clinical improvement. In response to concerns regarding the sufficiency of the clinical evidence presented, the applicant commented that because the patient population in the Tablosupreg System IDE study, was more diverse and reflective of the general dialysis population with respect to diabetes and other comorbidities than the population in the NxStagesupreg IDE study, study results regarding Tablosupreg System can be better applied to the Medicare population. In their application, the applicant claimed that Tablosupreg System patients can be expected to have fewer vascular access interventions, and health care providers will have increased flexibility in personalizing the frequency and duration of patient treatments.98 99 The applicant emphasized in its comment that Tablosupreg System users may experience reduced vascular access infection related hospitalizations, relying on data from the Tablosupreg System IDE study. The applicant stated that patients prescribed 5-6 days weekly dialysis sessions with NxStagesupreg who were converted to 4 weekly dialysis sessions with the Tablosupreg System, experienced no hospitalizations during the home arm of the trial. The applicant commented that these data were not included in the Tablosupreg System IDE publication because the sample size was modest and relatively few patients required hospitalization. The applicant also stated that 14 of the 35 patients enrolled in the NxStagesupreg IDE dropped out before completing the trial, making it difficult to calculate an unbiased estimate of the hospitalization rate. The applicant compared the Tablosupreg System IDE hospitalization rate to two North American observational studies by Weinhandl et al.100 and Suri et al.101 of patients receiving home HD likely NxStagesupreg or KHome. The applicant further stated that Suri et al. reported a hospitalization rate of 930 per 1000 patient-years and Weinhandl et al. noted a rate of 1663 per 1000 patient-years. The applicant stated that results from these studies suggest that patients receiving treatment at home with NxStagesupreg 5-6 times per week had similar, not lower, rates of hospitalization relative to matched patients receiving in-center hemodialysis. The applicant further noted that the modest sample size of the Tablosupreg System IDE precludes valid inference testing, but that the hospitalization rate observed 426 per 1000 patient-years was roughly one-quarter that seen among a national cohort of patients on home HD in the US, and less than one-half that seen among a Canadian cohort, despite the high proportion of non-white patients and patients with diabetes, characteristics typically associated with higher rates of hospitalization.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 98 FHN Trial Group. 2010.

American Journal of Kidney Diseases, 671, 98-110. 101 Suri, R. S., Li, L., amp Nesrallah, G. E. 2015. The risk of hospitalization and modality failure with home dialysis. Kidney international, 882, 360-368.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- With respect to the claim that the Tablosupreg System increases adherence to dialysis treatment and retention to home therapy, the applicant provided additional support. Specifically, the applicant stated that in its real-world home population, to date, no patients have chosen to return to in-center HD once going home with the Tablosupreg System. The applicant submitted new data to further establish first-year attrition comparisons. The applicant stated that it contracted with a third-party research firm 102 to conduct an analysis of patients dialyzing at home using the Tablosupreg System, matched to patients in the USRDS who completed home HD training between the years 2016 through 2018. Per the applicant, home HD attrition was defined as either death or conversion to in-facility HD and kidney transplantation was excluded from attrition. The applicant further stated that the cohort included 39 patients that initiated home HD with the Tablosupreg System since the devices FDA marketing authorization for home use in March of 2020.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 102 Analysis conducted by the Chronic Disease Research Group CDRG, a division of the Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicant further clarified that this patient population is separate and distinct from the participants in the Tablosupreg System IDE study. The applicant stated that there were 4 attrition events among the 39 Tablosupreg System users and 3,602 attrition events among the 9,827 home HD starts in the broader population of patients receiving home HD. The applicant further noted that the cumulative incidence of attrition at 1 year was 26.8 percent among Tablosupreg System users and 42.5 percent among all home HD starts with the unadjusted Cox regression hazard ratio of home HD attrition among Tablosupreg System users versus home HD starts in years 2016 through 2018 at 0.38 95 confidence interval, 0.14-1.02 p  0.06, a more than 60 percent reduction in attrition with the Tablosupreg System. The applicant also acknowledged that the limited sample size reduces power in demonstrating a statistically significant result, but asserted that the preliminary data suggest that use of the Tablosupreg System should reduce home HD attrition. In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, CMS acknowledged the applicants claim regarding the benefit of greater flexibility for patients in the way that they receive their dialysis treatments. The applicant stated in their comment that the Tablosupreg System represents substantial clinical improvement over NxStagesupreg in several ways Allowing patients, in consultation with their clinicians, to develop a treatment schedule tailored to their individual needs, reducing the time spent on dialysis-related tasks including the elimination of a 6-8 hour pre-treatment dialysate production, and reducing supply storage requirements. With respect to the claim that the Tablosupreg System improves patient quality of life, the applicant stated in their comment that Tablosupreg System IDE showed favorable effects on patient-reported outcomes, including the EQ-5D survey instrument that has been widely applied to many chronic disease populations, as well as a number of surveys related to the process of home dialysis. The applicants comment included the results from an online survey conducted by a third-party research firm 103 and a network of dialysis organizations and regional offices 104 between July 29 and August 9, 2021. PerPage 61903the applicant, 184 nephrologists and 202 patients were surveyed regarding a list of potential benefits and system features of a blinded home HD system concept reflecting the features of the Tablosupreg System. The applicant stated that 77 percent of nephrologists rated the Tablosupreg Systems features as a substantial clinical improvement in home HD care and 98 percent indicated that the Tablosupreg Systems benefits would make them more likely to recommend home HD to their patients. The applicant further stated that 72 percent of patients receiving in-center HD or PD rated the Tablosupreg Systems features as a significant improvement in home HD care and 77 percent of those patients stated they would be more likely to try home HD. The applicant stated that of the current home HD population dialyzing on the incumbent device, 84 percent rated the Tablosupreg Systems features as a significant improvement in home HD care.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 103 Health Advances, US Home Hemodialysis Nephrologist and Patient Perspectives Presentation, August 13, 2021. 104 National Kidney Foundation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicants comment acknowledged that NxStagesupreg would be an available option to patients who prefer to travel with a home dialysis device but stated that the majority of patients ranked the effectiveness of treatment above the ability to travel with their device. With respect to CMSs recall bias concern that participants experiences with NxStagesupreg were not recorded at the time they were receiving NxStagesupreg treatments, but rather, were based on recall at the time of the Tablosupreg System IDE study, the applicant clarified that 13 of the 29 Tablosupreg System IDE study participants who completed the trial had been dialyzing at home with NxStagesupreg in advance of the Tablosupreg System IDE study and that baseline surveys were taken while patients were actively treating with NxStagesupreg. The applicant commented that survey questions were sourced from validated sleep questionnaires and did not ask patients for a comparison to a prior time point, but focused on a rating of sleep during the prior week. The applicant commented that to further assess the prevalence of sleep related symptoms in home HD patients, a third-party research firm conducted a survey of current non-Tablosupreg System HD patients. The applicant stated that of home HD respondents, 64 percent reported very poor to poor sleep quality and all respondents stating that improved sleep would represent substantial clinical improvement.105 The applicant stated that collectively, its results confirm that achieving satisfactory sleep remains a major challenge for patients on dialysis and that using the Tablosupreg System has the potential to improve sleep quality, which may also enhance physical, cognitive, and sexual function, and expand functional capacity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 105 Health Advances, US Home Hemodialysis Nephrologist and Patient Perspectives Presentation, August 13, 2021.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The applicants comment emphasized the safety features and ease-of-use of the Tablosupreg System. The applicant stated that the Tablosupreg System offers patients a differentiated level of safety in having met higher, more updated safety standards of performance, such as fluid removal, air detection, temperature, dialysate flow rate and other parameters than the previously approved NxStagesupreg device. The applicant also stated that the remote monitoring and remote technical support features are only available with the Tablosupreg System and reduce patient apprehension to perform treatments at home. The applicants comment again asserted that, overall, the totality of the evidence demonstrates that the Tablosupreg System offers substantial clinical improvement in home HD treatment. Response We thank the applicant for their comment and have taken the additional information provided into consideration in our determination of whether the Tablosupreg System meets the eligibility criteria at Sec. 413.236b5 and Sec. 412.87b1. We have responded in further detail to comments discussing the significant clinical improvement claims for the Tablosupreg System at the end of this section II.C.5.c of the final rule. Comment We received many comments from clinicians, patients, and caregivers supporting the Tablosupreg Systems TPNIES application. For example, many commenters stated that using the Tablosupreg System is convenient and allows for the flexibility to personalize treatment for a diversity of patient needs. Commenters stated that patients are allowed to create their own schedules, which enables them to continue working and enjoying lifes activities. Patient commenters stated that they have become more active and engaged participants in their own care. Commenters appreciated the convenience and comfort of being able to dialyze at home instead of in-center, stating that doing so alleviates stress, reduces exposure to COVID-19 and reduces the burden of arranging for and traveling to in-center treatments. Patient and caregiver commenters expressed appreciation for the Tablosupreg Systems on-demand dialysate for several reasons. First, commenters stated that patients have more dialysis-free time by not needing to prepare solution or handle heavy bags of dialysate. Second, commenters stated that there are fewer supplies to store for the Tablosupreg System as compared to the NxStagesupreg System for which it was necessary to store up to 20 boxes of dialysate and supplies. Third, commenters stated that dialysate delivery may be challenged in regions with extreme climates and could compromise treatment. Commenters also stated that there is less wasted dialysate with use of the Tablosupreg System. Patient commenters identified several clinical improvements that they attribute to treatment with the Tablosupreg System including reduced cramping and fatigue after dialysis treatment, reduced need for blood pressure medication, improved mood, and less frequent use and wear on the vascular access site with fewer weekly treatments. Commenters also stated that that features and conveniences of the Tablosupreg System result in less burn out 106 of patients and caregivers, better adherence, retention and overall quality of life.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 106 As discussed in the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule 85 FR 71462, a significant challenge to increasing the use of home dialysis includes burn out or technique failure and return to in-center HD. According to one recent observational study, approximately 25 percent of patients who initiate home HD return to in-center HD within the first year Seshasai RK, Mitra N, Chaknos CM, Li J, Wirtalla C, Negoianu D, Glickman JD, Dember LM. Factors Associated With Discontinuation of Home Hemodialysis. Am J Kidney Dis. 2016 Apr674629-37.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Many commenters including patients, caregivers and clinicians commented on the Tablosupreg Systems features and ease-of-use. Commenters stated that the complexity of a dialysis machine and lengthy training can be intimidating and act as a deterrent in the adoption of home dialysis. Commenters stated that some patients and caregivers cannot afford extended absences from work, childcare or other responsibilities to complete dialysis training and that training with the Tablosupreg System ranges from 10 days to 2 weeks compared to training with NxStagesupreg which averages 4-6 weeks. Several commenters stated that patients with prior home dialysis experience can begin home treatments using the Tablosupreg System after just 3-4 training days. One commenter stated that a comparison of training for the Tablosupreg System versus other devices in the market does not exist. Commenters stated that patients may also fear not being able to remember what to do in an urgent situation and highlighted the Tablosupreg Systems safety features that prevent patient harm, including step-by-step instructions with less memorization, and fewer treatment steps, and 247 technical support.Page 61904Commenters stated that remote treatment monitoring in real time, allows clinicians to intervene as needed with treatment modifications. Commenters stated that the Tablosupreg Systems instructions can be set in other languages. Commenters also expressed appreciation for the Tablosupreg Systems built-in warmer that helps to prevent hypothermia during treatment, built-in blood pressure monitoring, flush feature, closed loop cartridge to minimize risk of infection, automatic record keeping, and the quicker set up and take down times. Commenters stated that the Tablosupreg System looks less like an intrusive medical device and the built-in wheels make it easy to move it from room to room. One commenter stated that patients previously not deemed suitable for home HD, due to large body size, work schedules, etc. may now become candidates with the use of the Tablosupreg System. Another commenter stated that patients lacking social support and financial resources may not be good candidates for home dialysis. Response We appreciate the input provided by these commenters. We have taken this information into consideration in our determination of whether the Tablosupreg System meets the eligibility criteria at Sec. 413.236b5 and Sec. 412.87b1. We have responded in further detail to comments discussing the significant clinical improvement claims for the Tablosupreg System at the end of this section II.C.5.c of the final rule. Comment We received several comments from health care providers and patients regarding the Tablosupreg System and less frequent dialysis treatments. A physician commenter stated that the question of whether less frequent dialysis is clinically preferable to shorter, more frequent dialysis sessions does not appear to be definitively decided in clinical research for all patients. The commenter stated that while patients derive significant benefit from more frequent dialysis, having the ability to achieve at least adequate dialysis at three days per week is a significant advancement compared with what has been offered. Commenters stated that the treating clinician remains in the best position to prescribe the appropriate frequency of dialysis for their patients but that it is possible for researchers to accurately assess improvements in clinical outcomes related to frequency of dialysis treatments. A commenter, who is a health care provider, shared their experience with the Tablosupreg System in a dialysis unit, stating that their unit tested the Tablosupreg System and found that on the whole, the patients could reach dialysis adequacy on a traditional thrice-weekly frequency. While this commenter referred to an abstract documenting these results, it was not provided. Response We appreciate the input provided by these commenters. We have taken this information into consideration in our determination of whether the Tablosupreg System meets the eligibility criteria at Sec. 413.236b5 and Sec. 412.87b1. We have responded in further detail to comments discussing the significant clinical improvement claims for the Tablosupreg System at the end of this section II.C.5.c of the final rule. Comment We received several comments from the public, including health care providers and patients, regarding how to demonstrate substantial clinical improvement in connection with a home hemodialysis machine such as the Tablosupreg System. One commenter stated that clinical trials, abstract data and expert opinion is sufficient to support substantial clinical improvement and that this type of evidence is often the basis of clinical guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation NKF Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative. The commenter stated that new companies are not equipped to conduct in-depth studies until they have significant numbers of patients on their device or therapy which creates a barrier to recruiting study participants and thus, limiting investment in the new technology. Another commenter stated that the ESRD sector does not easily lend itself to robust clinical trials, and this fact should be considered when determining whether an applicant for TPNIES has demonstrated substantial clinical improvement. Commenters referred to the CMS TPNIES application template, which indicates that published, unpublished, and clinical expertise are all acceptable forms of supporting evidence and that placing a heavy emphasize on published long-term studies for purposes of evaluating substantial clinical improvement limits the ability of new companies to enter the market and deprives patients of potentially lifesaving technologies. A non-profit dialysis association stated that CMS should consider the extent to which the technology has demonstrated improved quality of life in determining whether the technology represents substantial clinical improvement. Many commenters stated that patients should be given a choice in deciding which home hemodialysis machine is best for them, and that providing patients with an additional choice is evidence of substantial clinical improvement. A physician commenter indicated that it is not clear why patients prefer one machine over another or feel better with one prescription over another, but a choice based on patient preference can improve patient retention to a particular therapy, one of the ways to demonstrate substantial clinical improvement. This commenter stated that evidence that a home dialysis machine improves retention should be sufficient evidence to approve the TPNIES for that home dialysis machine. Response We appreciate the commenters input regarding whether the Tablosupreg System meets the innovation criterion at Sec. 413.236b5 and substantial clinical improvement criteria at Sec. 412.87b1. After carefully reviewing the application, the information submitted by the applicant addressing our concerns raised in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, as well as the many comments submitted by the public, we agree with the applicant and several members of the dialysis community that the Tablosupreg System represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. We find that the data submitted demonstrate greater medication adherence or compliance of home HD among users of the Tablosupreg System that is not as evident for users of existing home HD technologies, as specified under Sec. 412.87b1C7. We also believe that the Tablosupreg System may provide added flexibility around the frequency and duration of home HD that could benefit some patients, specifically, patients who may prefer fewer, slightly longer treatments but who would otherwise be limited to more frequent home HD treatments. We believe additional flexibilities around home HD treatments may represent an improvement in one or more activities of daily living and an improved quality of life for Medicare beneficiaries, as specified under Sec. 412.87b1C4 and Sec. 412.87b1C5, respectively. We also recognize that patient preference and choice is especially important for patients with ESRD, who undergo demanding, often grueling, dialysis therapy, and we believe that patients who prefer their method and frequency of dialysis are more likely to adhere to the therapy, and thus increase adherence rates overall. We acknowledge the concerns raised by commenters regarding the substantial clinical improvement claims in the Tablosupreg System application. As we had previously noted in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, we had some of the same concerns as commenters regardingPage 61905the evidence submitted to support the claims of significant clinical improvement. However, at this time, we feel that our concerns have been sufficiently addressed. For example, with respect to the applicants claim that the Tablosupreg System increases adherence to dialysis treatment and retention to home therapy, although the adherence and retention data provided in the initial application had limitations, additional information was submitted by the applicant to support this claim in its comment on the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule. This data showed lower attrition rates at 1 year between patients using the Tablosupreg System for home HD, separate from the group of patients in the Tablosupreg System IDE, matched with patients who had completed home HD patients, using data from the USRDS. With respect to the applicants claim that the Tablosupreg System improves patient quality of life, we note that the applicant addressed our concerns about the potential for recall bias in their claim of improved sleep quality and related symptoms in their comment, explaining that baseline surveys were taken while patients were actively treating with NxStagesupreg. Also, while some commenters opposed the applicants use of unpublished data to support its claim of improved hospitalization, we note that under Sec. 413.236b5 and 412.87b1iii, CMS may consider unpublished data in making a determination of substantial clinical improvement as we recognize in some situations, published data may not be available. Overall, we believe the applicant was able to address our concerns about its substantial clinical improvement claims from the discussion in the CY 2022 ESRD proposed rule. We also note that, under our TPNIES policy and Sec. 412.87b1i, CMS is required to consider the totality of the circumstances when making a determination that a new renal dialysis equipment or supply represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to renal dialysis services previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. We believe the circumstances we may consider in our review of the TPNIES applications, specifically within the context of the ESRD PPS, include the state of the ESRD landscape and the particular challenges and vulnerabilities of patients with ESRD. While we recognize that published studies and randomized controlled trials are often the gold standard in demonstrating superiority of one product over another, our review is not limited to evidence from large randomized controlled trials we also consider a range of evidence from published or unpublished information sources, including other appropriate information sources not otherwise listed under Sec. 412.87b1iii. As codified under Sec. 412.87b1iii, evidence from published or unpublished information sources may be sufficient to establish that a new technology represents a substantial clinical improvement. Additional information we considered in our review of the Tablosupreg System was the new data provided by the applicant surveying over 180 nephrologists and over 200 patients undergoing dialysis treatment HD, along with substantial supportive comments from patients, caregivers, and health care providers, about the benefits of the Tablosupreg System in providing an improved quality of life, an improvement in one or more activities of daily living, and a decreased rate of at least one subsequent therapeutic intervention, as specified under Sec. Sec. 12.87b1C6, 412.87b1C5, 412.87b1C2, respectively. We also note that, at this time, patients with ESRD are facing new, additional risks when receiving dialysis treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As some of the commenters noted, ESRD patients are among the most vulnerable in the Medicare population and are at an increased risk for COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality.107 108 As we discussed in the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule, Medicares ESRD population aligns with the profile of patients who are more susceptible to COVID-19. As we stated in that rule, we believe it is important to reduce the risk of infection among beneficiaries with ESRD, and this can be done through isolating patients from in-center exposure by encouraging home HD 85 FR 71416. We also believe that providing patients with an additional option for home HD is especially important given that the adoption of home HD has been limited, with approximately only 1 of ESRD patients utilizing this modality.109 Therefore, we are interested in supporting the use of technologies that expand patient options for dialyzing safely at home at this time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 107 Ziemba R, Campbell KN, Tang T, et al.

Home Hemodialysis. Uptodate. Nov 18, 2016.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- For all of these reasons, we conclude that the Tablosupreg System meets the TPNIES innovation criteria under Sec. 413.236b5 and Sec. 412.87b1.6 Capital Related Assets Criterion Sec. 413.236b6 Regarding the final TPNIES eligibility criterion under Sec. 413.236b6, whether the item is a capital-related asset that is a home dialysis machine, these terms are defined in Sec. 413.236a2. The applicant identified the Tablosupreg System as an asset that an ESRD facility has an economic interest in through ownership, is subject to depreciation, and is an HD machine that received FDA marketing authorization for home use. We received no public comments on this criterion. We agree that the Tablosupreg System is a capital-related asset and home dialysis machine and therefore meets this criterion. The remaining comments and our responses regarding the Tablosupreg System and its eligibility for the TPNIES are set forth below. Comment We received a comment that 70 of the patient population in the Tablosupreg System IDE study were non-white, suggesting Tablosupreg Systems ability to create greater home adoption and retention in ways that are aligned with the proposed incentive for closing gaps in health equity access to home HD. Response We thank the commenter for their input. While health equity is not a specific TPNIES eligibility criteria under Sec. 413.236b, we strongly support health equity and believe that the approval of the Tablosupreg System under the criterion of Sec. 413.236b will encourage uptake of home HD for vulnerable patients with ESRD. Comment We received several comments pertaining to the relationship between the cost of the Tablosupreg System and its connection to beneficiary access. Several commenters stated that the initial cost of the Tablosupreg System is 2 to 3 times that of older technologies, and that combined with potentially fewer treatments over which to amortize the cost, it would be difficult for ESRD facilities to incorporate the Tablosupreg System into their businesses without a payment adjustment under the ESRD PPS. These commenters expressed support for CMS approving the TPNIES for the Tablosupreg System. The applicant stated that after the initial capital investment, the per treatment costs of using the Tablosupreg System are considerably less than that of the NxStagesupreg System. Another commenter stated that the Tablosupreg System is more affordable than other home dialysis machines and is costPage 61906effective. Commenters stated that a TPNIES approval for the Tablosupreg System would help to offset the Tablosupreg Systems acquisition costs, particularly for small and mid-size dialysis organizations and independent providers and facilitate economies of scale, allowing ESRD facilities to lower the cost of home HD care in the future. Commenters also asserted that a TPNIES approval would increase home dialysis utilization and retention of patients on home dialysis, and improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes, overall. For example, several commenters stated that use of the Tablosupreg System may help to push the national home hemodialysis prevalence above its stagnant level of 2 percent and a TPNIES approval would further support the goals of the ETC Model. Response We appreciate the commenters input. We note that cost is not a consideration for TPNIES eligibility under Sec. 413.236b, and therefore is not relevant to our review of the Tablosupreg Systems application. However, we believe that approval of the Tablosupreg System supports the goals of the ETC model by expanding beneficiary access to and retention of home HD. Comment The Tablosupreg System applicant commented on the CMS spending estimate of Medicare payment for additional home HD sessions, noting differences between its analysis and that of CMS but agreeing with CMS estimates on spending for the fifth treatment. Several commenters stated that while existing guidance 110 allows for treatments more than three times per week when they are reasonable and necessary, coverage decisions are unrelated to the TPNIES eligibility determination. A commenter stated that the applicant provided no evidence regarding dialysis frequency for the population of patients that meet Medicares clinical coverage criteria for additional treatments.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 110 Medicare Coverage Database. Retrieved May 24, 2021 from Response We thank the commenters for their input and note that our CMS spending estimate of Medicare payment for additional home HD sessions that was included in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36339 was not part of our analysis of the TPNIES eligibility criteria in Sec. 413.236b. In addition, while Medicare clinical coverage criteria are beyond the scope of this rulemaking, we are not suggesting that the way in which ESRD facilities reflect home HD treatments on their claims would change due to our decision on the Tablosupreg System application. Comment We received several comments from health care professionals with experience in using the Tablosupreg System in a clinical setting, rather than a home setting. One commenter stated that the Tablosupreg System is a benefit for ESRD facilities with staffing shortages because less time will need to be spent with each patient. Several commenters shared their favorable experiences in using the Tablosupreg System in the hospital inpatient and intensive care unit settings and in treating COVID-19 patients. One commenter stated that 15 AKI inpatients with a mean age of 65 years were provided multiple Tablosupreg System treatments 3-6 times per week. The commenter further explained that the best urea reduction ratio achieved in the first 1-4 treatments, if available, was 41 most treatments were successful and were slowed for hypotension or tachycardia and some were aborted because of water pressure alarms signaling the need for filter replacement or clotted lines related to hypercoagulability among COVID-19 patients. The commenter further stated that most treatments were limited to 3-4 hours but up to 8 hours. Some commenters stated that patients treated with the Tablosupreg System in the hospital or ESRD facility setting gain familiarity and comfort with the device making it an easier transition to using the system at home. Response We thank the commenters for their input. Currently, the only capital-related assets not excluded from eligibility for the TPNIES under Sec. 413.236b6 are home dialysis machines used in the home for a single patient, as defined in Sec. 413.236a2. While these commenters experiences with the Tablosupreg System do not involve its use in the home setting, we appreciate the additional input regarding the benefits of the Tablosupreg System. After a consideration of all the public comments received, we have determined that the evidence and public comments submitted are sufficient to demonstrate that the Tablosupreg System meets all of the eligibility criteria to qualify for the TPNIES for CY 2022. As a result, the Tablosupreg System will be paid for using a TPNIES per Sec. 413.236d.III. Calendar Year CY 2022 Payment for Renal Dialysis Services Furnished to Individuals With Acute Kidney Injury AKIA. Background The Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 TPEA Pub. L. 114-27 was enacted on June 29, 2015, and amended the Act to provide coverage and payment for dialysis furnished by an ESRD facility to an individual with acute kidney injury AKI. Specifically, section 808a of the TPEA amended section 1861s2F of the Act to provide coverage for renal dialysis services furnished on or after January 1, 2017, by a renal dialysis facility or a provider of services paid under section 1881b14 of the Act to an individual with AKI. Section 808b of the TPEA amended section 1834 of the Act by adding a subsection r to provide payment, beginning January 1, 2017, for renal dialysis services furnished by renal dialysis facilities or providers of services paid under section 1881b14 of the Act to individuals with AKI at the ESRD PPS base rate, as adjusted by any applicable geographic adjustment applied under section 1881b14DivII of the Act and adjusted on a budget neutral basis for payments under section 1834r of the Act by any other adjustment factor under section 1881b14D of the Act that the Secretary elects. In the CY 2017 ESRD PPS final rule, we finalized several coverage and payment policies to implement subsection r of section 1834 of the Act and the amendments to section 1881s2F of the Act, including the payment rate for AKI dialysis 81 FR 77866 through 77872, and 77965. We interpret section 1834r1 of the Act as requiring the amount of payment for AKI dialysis services to be the base rate for renal dialysis services determined for a year under the ESRD PPS base rate as set forth in Sec. 413.220, updated by the ESRD bundled market basket percentage increase factor minus a productivity adjustment as set forth in Sec. 413.196d1, adjusted for wages as set forth in Sec. 413.231, and adjusted by any other amounts deemed appropriate by the Secretary under Sec. 413.373 We codified this policy in Sec. 413.372 81 FR 77965.B. Summary of the Proposed Provisions, Public Comments, and Responses to Comments on the CY 2022 Payment for Renal Dialysis Services Furnished to Individuals With AKI The proposed rule, titled Medicare Program End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System, PaymentPage 61907for Renal Dialysis Services Furnished to Individuals With Acute Kidney Injury, End-Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Program, and End-Stage Renal Disease Treatment Choices Model 86 FR 36322 through 36437, referred to as the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, was published in the Federal Register on July 9, 2021, with a comment period that ended on August 31, 2021. In that proposed rule, we proposed to update the AKI dialysis payment rate for CY 2022. We received 6 public comments on our proposal from large dialysis organizations, a non-profit dialysis association, a professional association, a provider advocacy organization, and a healthcare group. In this final rule, we provide a summary of each proposed provision, a summary of the public comments received and our responses to them, and the policies we are finalizing for CY 2022 payment for renal dialysis services furnished to individuals with AKI.C. Annual Payment Rate Update for CY 2022 The payment rate for AKI dialysis is the ESRD PPS base rate determined for a year under section 1881b14 of the Act, which is the finalized ESRD PPS base rate, including the applicable annual productivity-adjusted market basket payment update, geographic wage adjustments, and any other discretionary adjustments, for such year. We note that ESRD facilities could bill Medicare for non-renal dialysis items and services and receive separate payment in addition to the payment rate for AKI dialysis. As discussed in section II.B.1.d of this final rule, the CY 2022 ESRD PPS base rate is 257.90, which reflects the application of the CY 2022 wage index budget-neutrality adjustment factor of 0.99985 and the CY 2022 ESRDB market basket increase of 2.4 percent reduced by the productivity adjustment of 0.5 percentage point, that is, 1.9 percent. Accordingly, we are finalizing a CY 2022 per treatment payment rate of 257.90 for renal dialysis services furnished by ESRD facilities to individuals with AKI. This payment rate is further adjusted by the wage index, as discussed in the next section of this final rule.2. Geographic Adjustment Factor Under section 1834r1 of the Act and Sec. 413.372, the amount of payment for AKI dialysis services is the base rate for renal dialysis services determined for a year under section 1881b14 of the Act updated by the ESRD bundled market basket and reduced by the productivity adjustment, as adjusted by any applicable geographic adjustment factor applied under section 1881b14DivII of the Act. Accordingly, we apply the same wage index under Sec. 413.231 that is used under the ESRD PPS and discussed in section II.B.1.b of this final rule. The AKI dialysis payment rate is adjusted by the wage index for a particular ESRD facility in the same way that the ESRD PPS base rate is adjusted by the wage index for that facility 81 FR 77868. Specifically, we apply the wage index to the labor-related share of the ESRD PPS base rate that we utilize for AKI dialysis to compute the wage adjusted per-treatment AKI dialysis payment rate. As stated previously, we are finalizing a CY 2022 AKI dialysis payment rate of 257.90, adjusted by the ESRD facilitys wage index. The comments and our responses to the comments on our AKI dialysis payment proposal are set forth below. Comment Several commenters, including a large dialysis organization and a professional association, commented in support of the proposed update to the AKI dialysis payment rate for CY 2022. They also expressed support for using the same methodology as in previous years for the AKI update. A large dialysis organization expressed specific appreciation for the detailed explanation of the CMS process and methodology to develop the AKI payment amount that has been included in prior rules. This organization noted that CMS has recognized that treatment for AKI differs from treatment for ESRD. The organization stated that although the services provided to AKI patients may be the same, their frequency may exceed those typically required by patients with ESRD. The organization also noted that in the CY 2017 ESRD PPS final rule, CMS indicated that it planned to make available public use files on utilization of services by AKI patients once the agency had compiled one full year of claims. The organization stated that CMS subsequently reported that the agency would continue to monitor utilization trends of items and services furnished to individuals with AKI. Along with other commenters, the large dialysis organization supports the data collection effort and CMSs commitment to ensure a data-driven approach to developing methodological changes to the AKIs rate development. The commenters urged CMS to share its monitoring plans to allow the public to better understand the specific data elements that CMS is collecting and analyzing. Response We appreciate the comments in support of the AKI payment rate update. As the commenter stated, we have been monitoring the trends of AKI beneficiaries in ESRD facilities and acute inpatient hemodialysis. This has included quantification of drugs, laboratory tests and other services provided on acute inpatient dialysis claims. We also examine other diagnoses recorded before an acute inpatient dialysis claim. During the TEP held in December 2020, we reviewed dialysis-related costs, resource utilization and characteristics of the AKI-D outpatient dialysis for patients with AKI population beginning January 1, 2017, when their outpatient dialysis treatment first became eligible under the ESRD PPS claims. That report can be found at the following link As we continue to analyze costs, utilization and patient characteristics, we will also examine data as it relates to an additional site of service for AKI patients. We will also incorporate additional data monitoring for COVID-19 patients who have experienced AKI. The results of the data analysis will be shared in the future in public use files on the ESRD PPS website. Final Rule Action We are finalizing the AKI payment rate as proposed, that is, the AKI payment rate is based on the finalized ESRD PPS base rate. Specifically, the final CY 2022 ESRD PPS base rate is 257.90 Accordingly, we are finalizing a CY 2022 payment rate of 257.90 for renal dialysis services furnished by ESRD facilities to individuals with AKI.IV. End-Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Program ESRD QIPA. Background For a detailed discussion of the End-Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Programs ESRD QIPs background and history, including a description of the Programs authorizing statute and the policies that we have adopted in previous final rules, we refer readers to the following final rules CY 2011 ESRD PPS final rule 75 FR 49030, CY 2012 ESRD PPS final rule 76 FR 628, CY 2012 ESRD PPS final rule 76 FR 70228, CY 2013 ESRD PPS final rule 77 FR 67450, CY 2014 ESRD PPS final rule 78 FR 72156, CY 2015 ESRD PPS final rule 79 FR 66120, CY 2016 ESRD PPS final rule 80 FR 68968,Page 61908 CY 2017 ESRD PPS final rule 81 FR 77834, CY 2018 ESRD PPS final rule 82 FR 50738, CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule 83 FR 56922, CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule 84 FR 60648, and CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule 85 FR 71398. We have also codified many of our policies for the ESRD QIP at 42 CFR 413.177 and 413.178 B. Extraordinary Circumstances Exception ECE Previously Granted for the ESRD QIP Including Notification of ECE Due to ESRD Quality Reporting System Issues1. Extraordinary Circumstance Exception ECE Previously Granted in Response to the COVID-19 PHE On March 22, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 PHE, we announced relief for clinicians, providers, hospitals, and facilities participating in Medicare quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs.111 On March 27, 2020, we published a supplemental guidance memorandum that described the scope and duration of the ECEs we were granting under each Medicare quality reporting and value-based purchasing VBP program.112 Each of these ECEs relieved these providers and facilities of their obligation to report data for Q4 CY 2019, Q1 and Q2 CY 2020, but we stated that we would score such data if optionally reported.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 111 CMS, Press Release, CMS Announces Relief for Clinicians, Providers, Hospitals and Facilities Participating in Quality Reporting Programs in Response to COVID-19 Mar. 22, 2020, 112 CMS, Exceptions and Extensions for Quality Reporting Requirements for Acute Care Hospitals, PPS-Exempt Cancer Hospitals, Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities, Skilled Nursing Facilities, Home Health Agencies, Hospices, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities, Long-Term Care Hospitals, Ambulatory Surgical Centers, Renal Dialysis Facilities, and MIPS Eligible Clinicians Affected by COVID-19 Mar. 27, 2020, The September 2020 IFC updated the ECE we granted in response to the COVID-19 PHE for the ESRD QIP and several other quality reporting programs 85 FR 54827 through 54838. In the IFC, we updated the ECE policy for the ESRD QIP 85 FR 54828 through 54830. First, we updated our regulations at Sec. 413.178d7 to state that a facility has opted out of the ECE for COVID-19 with respect to the reporting of Q4 CY 2019 NHSN data if the facility actually reported the data by the March 31, 2020 deadline but did not notify CMS that it would do so. Additionally, we finalized that facilities would not have the option to opt-out of the ECE we granted with respect to Q1 and Q2 2020 ESRD QIP data. We stated that measures calculated using excepted data could affect the national comparability of these data due to the geographic differences of COVID-19 incidence rates and hospitalizations along with different impacts resulting from different State and local law and policy changes implemented in response to COVID-19, and therefore may not provide a nationally comparable assessment of performance in keeping with the program goal of national comparison. In the September 2020 IFC, we welcomed public comments on our policy to update our regulations at Sec. 413.178d7 to consider a facility as having opted out of the ECE with respect to NHSN data reported for Q4 2019 if the facility actually reported the data by the submission deadline, without notifying CMS, and on the exception we finalized to the ECE opt out policy for the ESRD QIP to exclude any ESRD QIP data that facilities optionally reported during Q1 and Q2 2020 from our calculation of PY 2022 TPSs and from the baseline for PY 2023. The comments we received on these policies and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters supported CMS updated application of the ECE granted in response to the PHE due to COVID-19. A few commenters also agreed with CMS concerns regarding the national comparability of data from Q1 and Q2 of CY 2020 and noted that the integrity and validity of any measurement calculations associated with these data could be compromised. Response We thank commenters for their support. Comment A few commenters expressed strong concern that the data collected under the ESRD QIP will not adequately reflect the quality of care provided due to the impact of COVID-19 and the shortened data collection period. A few commenters noted that the data collected under the ESRD QIP for 2020 will be limited due to the COVID-19 PHE and the nationwide ECE excluding Q1 and Q2 data from consideration, and will undermine the reliability of measure results for scoring purposes. A few commenters recommended that CMS suspend penalties and payment adjustments for the 2020 performance year, expressing concern that the data collected under the ESRD QIP will not adequately reflect the quality of care provided due to the impact of the COVID-19 PHE and the nationwide ECE. Response We share commenters concerns regarding the potential impact on ESRD QIP measure calculations for PY 2022 due to the COVID-19 PHE and the shortened data collection period resulting from the nationwide ECE. In order to avoid unfairly penalizing facilities based on data that may not accurately reflect the quality of care provided due to circumstances beyond their control, in section IV.D of this final rule we are finalizing our proposal to adopt a special scoring and payment policy for PY 2022, under which we will not score or apply payment reductions to any ESRD facilities for PY 2022 under the ESRD QIP. Comment A few commenters expressed strong support for extending the ECE through the end of 2020, noting the continuing impact of COVID-19 on dialysis facilities. A few commenters also noted that COVID-19 case rates were higher in Q3 and Q4 of 2020 for patients attributed to dialysis facilities in certain geographic regions, and that these higher case rates may have affected performance scores under ESRD QIP. Response We agree that the impact of COVID-19 on dialysis facilities in 2020 has affected our ability to accurately measure their performance. We resumed data collection for the ESRD QIP on July 1, 2020 because we believe that collecting ESRD QIP measure data is important in order to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the data as it relates to factors such as the changing geographic differences in COVID-19 incidence and the quality of ESRD care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. However, to avoid unfairly penalizing facilities based on data that may not accurately reflect their quality of care, we are finalizing a measure suppression policy for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE and a special scoring and payment policy for PY 2022 in sections IV.C and IV.D of this final rule. Comment One commenter expressed support for CMS intention to provide subregulatory notice of decisions surrounding payment adjustments and penalties under the ESRD QIP. Response In the September 2020 IFC, we stated that in the interest of time and transparency, we may provide subregulatory advance notice of our intentions regarding payment adjustments and penalties 85 FR 54830. However, we would like to clarify that we would use rulemaking to propose any actual modifications to the ESRD QIP scoring and payment adjustment methodologies and that wePage 61909are using this final rule to finalize our scoring and payment adjustment policy for PY 2022. Comment One commenter requested that CMS provide further guidance to facilities regarding the criteria for requesting an ECE during a pandemic. Response The criteria for requesting an ECE under the ESRD QIP during a pandemic are the same as the criteria for requesting an ECE under the ESRD QIP due to other extraordinary circumstances beyond a facilitys control. These requirements can be found in our regulations at 42 CFR 413.178d3 through 7. Under these requirements, a facility may request an ECE within 90 days of the extraordinary circumstance occurring and must submit an ECE request form to CMS with the following information i Facility CCN. ii Facility name. iii CEO name and contact information. iv Additional contact name and contact information. v Reason for requesting an exception. vi Dates affected. vii Date the facility will start submitting data again, with justification for this date. viii Evidence of the impact of the extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to photographs, newspaper, and other media articles. In certain circumstances, such as a determination that an extraordinary circumstance has occurred that affects an entire region or locale, CMS may grant exceptions to facilities without a request. We note that facilities may also reject an ECE granted by CMS under certain circumstances. Technical details can be viewed on the QualityNet website.113--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 113 tab5.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- As established in the September 2020 IFC, we have finalized our updated application of the ECE granted in response to the COVID-19 PHE.2. ECE Due to ESRD Quality Reporting System EQRS Issues On November 9, 2020,114 we launched the ESRD Quality Reporting System EQRS. The EQRS contains the functionalities of the following three legacy ESRD Systems in one global application 1 A quality measure and VBP performance score review system ESRD QIP System 2 an ESRD patient registry and quality measure reporting system through the Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-enabled Network CROWNWeb and 3 Medicare coverage determination support through the Renal Management Information System REMIS. The transition to EQRS supports our efforts to consolidate the functionalities of the CROWNWeb, ESRD QIP System, and REMIS applications into a single system, and aims to provide ongoing support to the ESRD user community to foster accurate and timely monthly data submission. This migration eliminates the need for multiple user accounts, and will in the long-term also improve the overall user experience and reduce burden due to enhanced navigation features.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 114 In order to access EQRS, all authorized users must create an account with the Health Care Quality Information Systems HCQIS Access Roles and Profile, known as HARP, which is a secure identity management portal provided by CMS. Previously, users created separate accounts for each ESRD application through CMS Enterprise Identity Data Management EIDM system. Creating an account via HARP provides users with a user ID and password that can be used to access many CMS applications. It also provides a single location for users to modify their profile, change their password, update their challenge question, and add or remove two-factor authentication devices. Users can register for a HARP account by going to the QualityNet HARP Registration page, available at We stated in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36348 that since the launch of EQRS, several critical data submission issues had been identified that impact the overall quality and accuracy of data available to support the implementation of the ESRD QIP, and we suspended all clinical data submissions into EQRS to allow time to resolve the issue.115 Based on our assessment, the data submission issues only impacted ESRD QIP, Dialysis Star Ratings, Dialysis Facility Compare and data submitted for ESRD Network quality improvement activities. In the proposed rule, we noted that we had analyzed the data submission issues and stated our belief that the data systems issues would be resolved on or about July 12, 2021.116--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 115 116 On July 9, 2021, we announced that the EQRS data suspension will be concluded as of July 12, 2021, and that EQRS testing had been performed to ensure that the system is working as expected. We recognized that these operational systems issues would prevent facilities from submitting ESRD QIP clinical data until the data systems issues were resolved. Therefore, we announced a blanket extension of remaining CY 2020 clinical reporting deadlines 86 FR 36348 through 36349. Under this extension, facilities would have until September 1, 2021 to submit September through December 2020 ESRD QIP clinical data. In the proposed rule 86 FR 36348, we stated our belief that this reporting extension aligned with the time estimated for resolution of our operational systems issues and would give dialysis facilities nearly 7 weeks to submit their data to EQRS. We stated that we would provide further details to facilities when the EQRS issues were resolved, as well as when facilities could begin submitting their data for CY 2020 and CY 2021, through routine communication channels to facilities, vendors, Quality Improvement Organizations QIOs and ESRD Networks. We stated that the communications could include memos, emails, and notices on the public QualityNet website  As this situation was ongoing at the time, we stated in the proposed rule that we would announce any relevant extension deadlines and data submission requirements for impacted CY 2021 data through the routine communication channels discussed above. On September 3, 2021, we announced that the September 1, 2021 data submission deadline for September-December 2020 clinical data had been extended to September 15, 2021 in order to give facilities additional time to submit their data.117--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 117 We also have provided additional information at Because the current data submissions issue would not be resolved until or about July 12, 2021 and had impacted all facilities that participate in ESRD QIP, we stated our belief that granting a blanket ECE to all facilities without a request under 42 CFR 413.178d6ii was the appropriate remedy under these circumstances. We also stated our belief that requiring facilities to report the CY 2020 data impacted by this ECE by September 1, 2021 was reasonable. In our data suspension announcements, we noted that facilities were expected to continue to use EQRS to collect clinical data to complete tasks such as admit and discharge patients, complete CMSPage 61910forms such as the CMS-2728 End Stage Renal Disease Medical Evidence Report Medicare Entitlement andor Patient Registration, CMS-2744 End Stage Renal Disease Annual Facility Survey Form, and CMS-2746 ESRD Death Notification, add or update treatment summaries, resolve notifications within a timely manner, and should also continue to keep facilities information up-to-date.118 In other words, although facilities were unable to submit clinical data through EQRS, facilities were advised that they must continue to collect the clinical data.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 118 In the proposed rule 86 FR 36349, we stated that while we were working to resolve all known systems issues by July 12, 2021 and reopen submissions so that facilities may submit their September through December 2020 ESRD QIP data no later than September 1, 2021, we would only be able to ensure the validity of the impacted data after they are submitted. Given that the system issues experienced during the initial implementation of the EQRS, if not fully resolved, could potentially impact the accuracy and reliability of the data reported, we were concerned that facilities may be unfairly penalized because the current systems issues may impact the quality of the data. The EQRS system issues had resulted in multiple or incorrect dates of patient admissions andor discharges, as well as showing duplicate patient records. Facilities had also expressed concerns about their experience with EQRS issues, noting that there was no way for a facility to verify accuracy or completeness. They had reported issues including missing record status in response files, which meant that facilities did not know if the records were accepted or received an error response, and issues with determining whether clinical data were accepted because the information did not show in the user interface or the reports that facilities were receiving from EQRS. We stated in the proposed rule that we recognized stakeholders concerns about the potential impact to the quality of data for CY 2020. We stated our belief that the observed system issues, and any unresolved issues that may be identified only after data submissions are resumed, could impact the quality and accuracy of the data needed to calculate accurate ESRD QIP scores used for PY 2022 ESRD QIP calculations because patient admittance dates, discharge dates, record status in response files, clinical data, and the number of active patient cases are data points that are included in measure calculations for all of the PY 2022 ESRD QIP measures. If these data points were incorrect, then this would impact our ability to accurately calculate measures and would distort a facilitys measure performance. Therefore, because of the EQRS system issues described above, and additionally, due to the impact of the COVID-19 PHE on some of the PY 2022 ESRD QIP measures, as described more fully in section IV.C of this final rule, we proposed to not score or award a TPS to any facility, or reduce payment to any facility, in PY 2022. As discussed more fully in section IV.D below, we are finalizing that proposal in this final rule. Although we considered if there may be any alternative data sources for the measures impacted by these EQRS system issues, we concluded that this was not feasible for several reasons. First, all 14 ESRD QIP measures for PY 2022 were impacted by these system issues. Although certain measures do not require that facilities submit clinical data into EQRS, we use EQRS data to determine whether a facility has treated a sufficient number of patients in order to meet the measures minimum patient case threshold necessary to calculate the measure for ESRD QIP. For example, the National Healthcare Safety Network NHSN Bloodstream Infection BSI clinical measure requires that facilities report data to NHSN. However, the measure also has a requirement to exclude facilities that do not treat at least 11 eligible in-center hemodialysis patients during the 12 month performance period. In order to determine whether a facility has treated at least 11 eligible patients, we use EQRS admission data and Medicare claims data in order to determine whether the facility is eligible to receive a score on the measure.119--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 119 We ultimately decided to propose the special rule for PY 2022, as described further, because not only do these system issues impact all ESRD QIP measures, which could lead to distorted performance scores and unfair penalties, but we also wanted to provide facilities with the business certainty they need regarding their PY 2022 payments. In order to determine whether all data quality issues have been resolved when EQRS reopens for data submissions, we stated that we would need time to validate the impacted data after facilities are able to resume data submission. Due to the timing of this reporting extension, we stated our belief that there were no feasible alternative data sources for PY 2022. Therefore, we stated that the scoring and payment modifications we proposed for PY 2022 were appropriate in this situation. Comment Several commenters expressed appreciation and support for the reporting extension granted due to EQRS issues. A few commenters noted that facilities have experienced challenges with reporting data to EQRS and that the extension is helpful particularly as facilities continue to also address the impact of the COVID-19 PHE. Response We thank the commenters for their support. Comment A few commenters requested that CMS extend the reporting extension to the end of CY 2021, noting the ongoing COVID-19 PHE and continued challenges with data reporting. One commenter expressed the belief that extending the reporting deadline to the end of CY 2021 will help to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data submitted. One commenter expressed concern that EQRS issues may not be fully resolved by the anticipated deadline, and requested that CMS issue further flexibilities if necessary. Response Although we initially extended the data submission deadline to September 1, 2021, we subsequently extended that deadline to September 15, 2021 in order to give facilities additional time to submit their data. We note that all outstanding EQRS issues have been resolved and we reopened access to EQRS on July 12, 2021. We believe that 2 months was sufficient time for facilities to report September through December 2020 ESRD QIP data. Comment A few commenters expressed support for the issuance of notifications through routine communication channels, in the event that an additional extension is granted due to unresolved EQRS issues. Response We thank the commenters for their support.C. Flexibilities for the ESRD QIP in Response to the COVID-19 PHE1. Adoption of a Measure Suppression Policy for the Duration of the COVID-19 PHE In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, we stated that in previous rules, we have identified the need for flexibility in our quality measurement programs to account for changing conditions that are beyond participating facilities or practitioners control. We identified this need because we would like to ensure that participants in ourPage 61911programs are not affected negatively when their quality performance suffers for reasons not due to the care provided, but instead due to external factors. A significant example of the type of external factor that may affect quality measurement is the COVID-19 PHE, which has had, and continues to have, significant and ongoing effects on the provision of medical care in the country and around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated PHE have impeded effective quality measurement in many ways. Changes to clinical practices to accommodate safety protocols for medical personnel and patients, as well as unpredicted changes in the number of stays and facility-level case mixes, have affected the data used in quality measurement and the resulting quality scores. Measures used in the ESRD QIP need to be evaluated to determine whether their specifications need to be updated to account for new clinical guidelines, diagnosis or procedure codes, and medication changes that we have observed during the PHE. Additionally, because COVID-19 prevalence is not consistent across the country, dialysis facilities located in different areas have been affected differently at different times throughout the pandemic. Under those circumstances, we stated in the proposed rule that we remain significantly concerned that the ESRD QIPs quality measure scores that are calculated using data submitted during the PHE for COVID-19 will be distorted and will result in skewed payment incentives and inequitable payments, particularly for dialysis facilities that have treated more COVID-19 patients than others. We further stated that it is not our intention to penalize dialysis facilities based on measure scores that we believe are distorted by the COVID-19 pandemic and, thus, not reflective of the quality of care that the measures in the ESRD QIP were designed to assess. As previously discussed, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, significant and enduring effects on health care systems around the world, and affects care decisions, including those made on clinical topics covered by the ESRD QIPs measures. As a result of the COVID-19 PHE, dialysis facilities could provide care to their patients that meets the underlying clinical standard but results in worse measured performance, and by extension, payment penalties in the ESRD QIP. We also stated that we are concerned that regional differences in COVID-19 prevalence during the performance period for PY 2022 have directly affected dialysis facilities measure scores on the ESRD QIP for PY 2022. Although these regional differences in COVID-19 prevalence rates do not reflect differences in the quality of care furnished by dialysis facilities, they could directly affect the payment penalties that these facilities could receive and could result in an unfair and inequitable distribution of those penalties. These inequities could be especially pronounced for dialysis facilities that have treated a large number of COVID-19 patients. We therefore proposed to adopt a policy for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE that would enable us to suppress the use of ESRD QIP measure data for all facilities if we determine that circumstances caused by the COVID-19 PHE have affected those measures and the resulting total performance scores TPSs significantly 86 FR 36350. We also proposed to suppress certain measures for the PY 2022 program year because we have determined that circumstances caused by the COVID-19 PHE have affected those measures significantly. In addition, due to both the impacts of the COVID-19 PHE on certain measures and the EQRS system issues described in section IV.B.2 we proposed to adopt a special scoring and payment rule for PY 2022, as described more fully in section IV.D In developing the proposed policy, we considered what circumstances caused by the COVID-19 PHE would affect a quality measure significantly enough to warrant its suppression in a value-based purchasing VBP program. We stated our belief that a significant deviation in measured performance that can be reasonably attributed to the COVID-19 PHE is a significant indicator of changes in clinical conditions that affect quality measurement. Similarly, we stated our belief that a measure may be focused on a clinical topic or subject that is proximal to the disease, pathogen, or other health impacts of the PHE. As has been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, we stated our belief that rapid or unprecedented changes in clinical guidelines and care delivery, potentially including appropriate treatments, drugs, or other protocols may affect quality measurement significantly and should not be attributed to the participating facility positively or negatively. We also noted that scientific understanding of a particular disease or pathogen may evolve quickly during an emergency, especially in cases of new disease or conditions. Finally, we stated our belief that, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic, national or regional shortages or changes in health care personnel, medical supplies, equipment, diagnostic tools, and patient case volumes or case mix may result in significant distortions to quality measurement. Based on these considerations, we developed a number of Measure Suppression Factors that we believe should guide our determination of whether to propose to suppress ESRD QIP measures for one or more payment years that overlap with the COVID-19 PHE. We proposed to adopt these Measure Suppression Factors for use in the ESRD QIP and, for consistency, the following other VBP programs Hospital VBP Program, Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, Hospital-Acquired Condition HAC Reduction Program, and Skilled Nursing Facility VBP Program see, for example, 86 FR 25460 through 25462, 25470 through 25472, and 25497 through 25499. We stated our belief that these Measure Suppression Factors will help us evaluate measures in the ESRD QIP and that their adoption in the other VBP programs noted previously will help ensure consistency in our measure evaluations across programs. The proposed Measure Suppression Factors are as follows Factor 1 Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during the COVID-19 PHE, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years. Factor 2 Clinical proximity of the measures focus to the relevant disease, pathogen, or health impacts of the COVID-19 PHE. Factor 3 Rapid or unprecedented changes in  Clinical guidelines, care delivery or practice, treatments, drugs, or related protocols, or equipment or diagnostic tools or materials or  the generally accepted scientific understanding of the nature or biological pathway of the disease or pathogen, particularly for a novel disease or pathogen of unknown origin. Factor 4 Significant national shortages or rapid or unprecedented changes in  Healthcare personnel  medical supplies, equipment, or diagnostic tools or materials or  patient case volumes or facility-level case mix. In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, we also considered alternatives to this proposed policy that could fulfill our objective to not penalize dialysis facilities for measure results that are distorted due to the COVID-19 PHE. As previously noted, the country continues to grapple with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in MarchPage 619122020, CMS issued a nationwide, blanket Extraordinary Circumstances Exception ECE for all hospitals and other facilities participating in our quality reporting and VBP programs in response to the COVID-19 PHE. This blanket ECE excepted all data reporting requirements for Q1 and Q2 2020 data, including claims data and data collected through the CDCs web-based surveillance system for this data period, and quality data collection resumed on July 1, 2020. For claims-based measures, we also stated that we would exclude all qualifying Q1 and Q2 2020 claims from our measure calculations. We considered extending this blanket ECE that we issued for Q1 and Q2 2020 to also include Q3 and Q4 2020. This alternative would have protected providers and suppliers from having their quality data used for quality scoring purposes if those data were likely to have been affected significantly by the COVID-19 PHE. However, this option would have made quality data collection and reporting to CMS no longer mandatory and would have left us with no comprehensive data available to provide confidential performance feedback to providers nor for monitoring and to inform decision-making for potential future programmatic changes, particularly as the PHE is extended. As an alternative to the proposed quality measure suppression policy, we also considered not suppressing any measures under the ESRD QIP. However, this alternative would mean assessing dialysis facilities using quality measure data that has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, given the geographic disparities in the COVID-19 pandemics effects, we stated in the proposed rule that implementation of the PY 2022 ESRD QIP as previously finalized would place dialysis facilities in regions that were more heavily impacted by the pandemic in Q3 and Q4 of 2020 at a disadvantage compared to facilities in regions that were more heavily impacted during the first two quarters for CY 2020 86 FR 36350 through 36351. We stated in the proposed rule that we viewed this measure suppression proposal as a necessity to ensure that the ESRD QIP does not penalize facilities based on external factors that were beyond the control of facilities. We intended for this proposed policy to provide short-term relief to dialysis facilities when we have determined that one or more of the Measure Suppression Factors warrants the suppression of an ESRD QIP measure. We welcomed public comments on this proposal for the adoption of a measure suppression policy for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE, and also on the proposed Measure Suppression Factors that we developed for purposes of this proposed policy. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Many commenters expressed support for the measure suppression policy for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE. Several commenters expressed appreciation that the proposed measure suppression policy would help to address the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 PHE. Several commenters expressed support for the proposed measure suppression policy, noting that measure scores may be distorted due to the substantial impact of the COVID-19 PHE on facility performance and that such a policy would help to avoid penalizing facilities based on potentially distorted data due to the COVID-19 PHE. Response We thank commenters for their support. Comment One commenter acknowledged the benefit of the proposed measure suppression policy, but also expressed concern regarding the exclusion of data showing the high morbidity and mortality of ESRD patients with COVID-19. Response Although we will not score facilities using data submitted during the ECE, we do intend to make individual facility data that was reported available to that facility so that the facility has an opportunity assess the impact of COVID-19 on its ESRD patients. We will also publicly report the measure rates with appropriate caveats. We believe that providing as much information as possible to facilities in this way while also publicly reporting performance data to the public with appropriate caveats balances fairness in our value-based purchasing programs with the publics need for transparency. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposals to address the negative impact of the pandemic on the ESRD QIP and recommended that CMS consider similar considerations for CY 2021 measure data. A few commenters strongly recommended that CMS consider extending relief under the ESRD QIP to PY 2023, citing the rise of the Delta variant and continuing impact of COVID-19 on facilities as well as the healthcare system nationwide. These commenters noted the continuing impact of the PHE on ESRD QIP measures, due both to the impact of COVID-19 on ESRD patients which may result in new hospital admissions and impact facility performance on SHR and SRR measures, as well as the strain on the healthcare system due to the influx of COVID-19 patients which may impact the availability of vascular access procedures and transplant evaluations. A few commenters noted that geographic variations in the COVID-19 PHE during CY 2021 continue to exacerbate distortions in ESRD QIP measure performance. Response The measure suppression policy that we are finalizing in this final rule applies for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE. We will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 PHE on dialysis facilities, and we would consider proposing in a future rulemaking to suppress one or more individual ESRD QIP measures for a future ESRD QIP payment year if we conclude that circumstances caused by the COVID-19 PHE have affected those measures and the resulting TPSs based on CY 2021 data. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposed Measure Suppression Factors. Several commenters noted that they will help to mitigate the negative impact of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 PHE such as significant deviation in national performance, the distorting impact on measures themselves, changing guidelines and protocols related to the PHE, and challenges due to shortages in both medical supplies, staffing, and patient volume and case-mix on quality measures. One commenter expressed support for the proposed Measure Suppression Factors, noting that they will help to ensure consistency in measure evaluation and suppression. Response We thank commenters for their support. Comment A few commenters expressed concern regarding the proposed Measure Suppression Factors. One commenter expressed concern that proposed Measure Suppression Factor 2 may overlook indirect or downstream clinical impacts that may not be considered proximate, noting for example the impact of the COVID-19 PHE shutdown on non-urgent scheduled vascular placement procedures leading to reduced catheter insertions and fistula rates as well as a delay in patient follow up regarding such procedures due to patient fears of COVID-19 exposure. One commenter expressed concern that proposed Measure Suppression Factor 4 does not sufficiently address regional or State-by-State impacts on personnel, patient volumes or case-mix, and medicalPage 61913supplies or equipment, and recommended that CMS broaden application of its scope to include sub-national, regional, and State impacts. One commenter recommended that CMS consider under Measure Suppression Factor 4 the impact of healthcare personnel shortages on ESRD facilities as a result of the COVID-19 PHE. One commenter recommended that CMS consider including under Measure Suppression Factor 4 circumstances where there is a statistically meaningful lower denominator from prior years due to factors outside of a facilitys control, such as changes in demographics. Response We developed the Measure Suppression Factors based on several considerations specifically related to the PHE for COVID-19, including national, regional, and State impacts. For example, we note that Measure Suppression Factor 4 addresses healthcare shortages in personnel as well as patient volumes and facility-level case mix. We believe the Measure Suppression Factors we are adopting for the COVID-19 PHE are sufficient to guide us in identifying whether circumstances caused by the COVID-19 PHE have affected ESRD QIP measures and the resulting TPSs. Comment One commenter recommended adding an additional measure suppression factor to suppress a measure in cases where the measure denominator is statistically meaningfully lower due to circumstances beyond the facilitys control such as COVID-19 mortality, noting that this may significantly also impact measure performance. Response We believe that the commenters suggestion would be captured by the proposed Measure Suppression Factor 4. As we discussed in the proposed rule 86 FR 36350, we developed these suppression factors to assess changing conditions due to the COVID-19 PHE and proposed them consistently in several of our value-based purchasing programs. As we stated above, we believe the Measure Suppression Factors we are adopting for the COVID-19 PHE are sufficient to guide us in identifying whether circumstances caused by the COVID-19 PHE have affected ESRD QIP measures and the resulting TPSs. Comment A few commenters expressed support for the proposal to provide confidential feedback reports to dialysis facilities under the proposed measure suppression policy, noting that it will allow facilities to focus on performance improvement and also allow CMS to track developments in the field. Response We thank the commenters for their support and note that we are finalizing this proposal in this final rule. Comment One commenter expressed support for the public reporting of performance scores from CY 2020 with appropriate caveats. Response We thank the commenter for its support. Comment A few commenters did not support the public reporting of suppressed measures, noting reliability concerns due to the impact of the COVID-19 PHE on measure data. Response We believe it is important to balance fairness with the publics need for transparency. Therefore, we intend to make the data publicly available. In order to address concerns about publicly reporting data that was collected by facilities during the COVID-19 PHE, we will appropriately caveat the publicly displayed data for suppressed measures to note that the measures have been suppressed for purposes of scoring and payment adjustments because of the effects of the COVID-19 PHE. We believe these caveats will mitigate any public confusion that could otherwise result from the display. Final Rule Action After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to adopt a measure suppression policy for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE. We are also finalizing the proposed Measure Suppression Factors that we proposed for purposes of this measure suppression policy. We will also publicly report the data with appropriate caveats.2. Suppression of Four ESRD QIP Measures for PY 2022a. Background In response to the PHE for COVID-19, we conducted analyses of the 14 current ESRD QIP measures to determine whether and how COVID-19 may have impacted the validity of these measures. For the reasons discussed in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, we concluded that COVID-19 has so severely impacted the validity of four measures that we believe we cannot fairly and equitably score these measures for the PY 2022 program year. Accordingly, we proposed to suppress these measures for the PY 2022 program year for all ESRD QIP participants 86 FR 36351. Specifically, the measures we proposed to suppress for the PY 2022 ESRD QIP are as follows SHR clinical measure under Measure Suppression Factor 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during the COVID-19 PHE, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years and Measure Suppression Factor 4, Significant national shortages or rapid or unprecedented changes in  healthcare personnel  medical supplies, equipment, or diagnostic tools or materials or  patient case volumes or facility-level case mix Standardized Readmission Ratio SRR clinical measure under Measure Suppression Factor 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during the COVID-19 PHE, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years and Measure Suppression Factor 4, Significant national shortages or rapid or unprecedented changes in  healthcare personnel  medical supplies, equipment, or diagnostic tools or materials or  patient case volumes or facility-level case mix In-Center Hemodialysis Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems ICH CAHPS Survey Administration clinical measure under Measure Suppression Factor 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during the COVID-19 PHE, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years and Long-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure under Measure Suppression Factor 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during the COVID-19 PHE, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years. We received comments on additional measures that we should consider suppressing and address them below. Comment Several commenters recommended that we suppress the Standardized Fistula Rate measure. A few commenters noted that the Standardized Fistula Rate measure and the Long-Term Catheter Rate measure are both Hemodialysis Vascular Access measures, but only the Long-Term Catheter Rate measure is proposed for suppression. A few commenters noted that AV fistula placements may have been delayed because it was not clear whether such procedures were considered an elective surgery in the beginning of the PHE and also becausePage 61914ESRD patients may have delayed or avoided medical treatments because of COVID-19 concerns. Several commenters recommended that CMS suppress the Percentage of Prevalent Patients Waitlisted PPPW measure, noting that the COVID-19 PHE had a significant negative impact on transplant surgeries, referrals and waitlists, as well as other related areas. A few commenters also noted that waitlist additions significantly decreased during the COVID-19 PHE. A few commenters recommended that CMS consider suppressing the KtV Dialysis Adequacy measure, noting that the impact of the COVID-19 PHE on catheter rates has a corresponding impact on the KtV measure, as patients with catheters will have lower KtV rates. One commenter recommended suppressing the KtV Dialysis Adequacy measure under proposed Measure Suppression Factor 1, due to significant deviation in national measure performance. One commenter recommended that CMS suppress the NHSN BSI clinical measure under Measure Suppression Factor 3 and Factor 4, noting that challenges in care delivery and treatment related to catheter removal and AVF insertion resulted in an increased likelihood of patient infection, as well as an increase in patient volume and case-mix due to COVID-19 patients developing AKI and requiring catheterization. Response At the time of the proposed rule, there was not sufficient data to determine whether suppression was appropriate for the Standardized Fistula Rate measure, the PPPW measure, the KtV Dialysis Adequacy measure, or the NHSN BSI clinical measure. We note that the status of the data remains unchanged since the proposed rule was published. Although we agree with commenters that performance on the Standardized Fistula Rate measure is linked to measure performance on the Long-Term Catheter Rate measure, the data that was available at the time of the proposed rule indicated that the COVID-19 PHE had a comparatively lower impact on the Standardized Fistula Rate measure. For the PPPW measure, our analysis of the relevant data available at the time of the proposed rule indicated temporal declines in waitlist removal among prevalent patients and similarly a decline in waitlisting and transplants in incident ESRD patients in March 2020 through May 2020 compared to prior years. However, we also observed that trends generally returned to normal starting in June and July 2020 and reflected data similar to prior years. Although performance on the KtV Dialysis Adequacy measure deviated temporarily, our analysis indicated that KtV rates stabilized shortly thereafter and reflect measure performance similar to prior years. Based on our analysis, KtV rates in CY 2020 were similar to rates in CY 2019 until April, where they dropped by an average of 0.4 percent. However, beginning in June 2020, KtV rates were the same as or higher than national average rates in March 2020. We were unable to assess the impact of the COVID-19 PHE on the NHSN BSI clinical measure, which requires a full 12 months of data in order to calculate measure performance. The CDC will not be able to calculate measure performance for the NHSN BSI clinical measure because the nationwide ECE granted in response to the COVID-19 PHE excepted data from Q1 and Q2 of CY 2020. As a result, facilities will not receive scores for the NHSN BSI clinical measure. We also note that suppressing the NHSN BSI clinical measure would be unlikely under Measure Suppression Factor 3 and Factor 4, as the links between those factors and the impacts on measure performance cited by the commenter are not sufficiently direct. Although challenges in care delivery and treatment related to catheter removal and AVF insertion resulted in an increased likelihood of patient infection, as well as an increase in patient volume and case-mix due to COVID-19 patients developing AKI and requiring catheterization, neither of those directly caused patients to develop more bloodstream infections as a result of the COVID-19 PHE. However, we will continue to monitor and review the data and consider proposing in a future rulemaking to suppress one or more individual ESRD QIP measures for a future ESRD QIP payment year if we conclude that circumstances caused by the COVID-19 PHE have affected those measures and the resulting TPSs based on CY 2021 data.b. Suppression of the SHR clinical measure for PY 2022 In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36351 through 36352, we proposed to suppress the SHR clinical measure for the PY 2022 program year under proposed Measure Suppression Factor 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during the COVID-19 PHE, which could be significantly better or significantly worse as compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years. The SHR clinical measure is an all-cause, risk-standardized rate of hospitalizations during a 1-year observation window. The standardized hospitalization ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of hospital admissions that occur for Medicare ESRD dialysis patients treated at a particular facility to the number of hospitalizations that would be expected given the characteristics of the dialysis facilitys patients and the national norm for dialysis facilities. This measure is calculated as a ratio but can also be expressed as a rate. The intent of the SHR clinical measure is to improve health care delivery and care coordination to help reduce unplanned hospitalization among ESRD patients. Based on our analysis of Medicare dialysis patient data from January 2020 through August 2020, we found that hospitalizations involving patients diagnosed with COVID-19 resulted in higher mortality rates, higher rates of discharge to hospice or skilled nursing facilities, and lower rates of discharge to home than hospitalizations involving patients who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Specifically, the hospitalization rate for Medicare dialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was more than 7 times greater than the hospitalization rate during the same period for Medicare dialysis patients who were not diagnosed with COVID-19, which is much greater than the relative risk of hospitalization for any other comorbidity. In the proposed rule 86 FR 36351, we stated that this indicates that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the hospitalization rate for dialysis patients. Because COVID-19 Medicare dialysis patients are at significantly greater risk of hospitalization, and the SHR clinical measure was not developed to account for the impact of COVID-19 on this patient population, we expressed our concern about the effects of the observed COVID-19 hospitalizations on the SHR clinical measure. We also noted that COVID-19 affected different regions of the country at different rates depending on factors like time of year, geographic density, State and local policies, and health care system capacity. Because of the increased hospitalization risk associated with COVID-19 and the Medicare dialysis patient population, we expressed our concern that these regional differences in COVID-19 rates have led to distorted hospitalization rates such that we could not reliably measure national performance on the SHR clinical measure. Our analysis of the available Medicare claims data indicated that the COVID-19 PHE has had significant effects on hospital admissions of dialysis patients,Page 61915and would result in significant deviation in national performance on the measure during the COVID-19 PHE which could be significantly worse as compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years. Not only are there effects on patients diagnosed with COVID-19, but the presence of the virus strongly affected hospital admission patterns of dialysis patients from March 2020 to June 2020, and we expressed our concern that similar effects would be seen in the balance of the calendar year CY as the PHE continued. Because the COVID-19 pandemic swept through geographic regions of the country unevenly, we expressed our concern that dialysis facilities in different regions of the country would have been affected differently throughout the 2020 year, thereby skewing measure performance and affecting national comparability due to significant and unprecedented changes in patient case volumes or facility-level case mix. Given the limitations of the data available to us for CY 2020, we stated our belief the resulting performance measurement on the SHR clinical measure would not be sufficiently reliable or valid for use in the ESRD QIP. We proposed to suppress this measure for the PY 2022 program year, rather than remove it, because we believe that the SHR clinical measure is an important part of the ESRD QIP measure set. However, we were concerned that the COVID-19 PHE affected measure performance on the current SHR clinical measure such that we would not be able to score facilities fairly or equitably on it. Additionally, we stated that we would continue to collect the measures claims data from participating facilities so that we could monitor the effect of the circumstances on quality measurement and determine the appropriate policies in the future. We would also continue to provide confidential feedback reports to facilities as part of program activities to ensure that they are made aware of the changes in performance rates that we observe. We also stated our intent to publicly report PY 2022 data where feasible and appropriately caveated. In the proposed rule, we stated that we were currently exploring ways to adjust effectively for the systematic effects of the COVID-19 PHE on hospital admissions for the SHR clinical measure. However, we are still working to improve these COVID-19 adjustments and verify the validity of a potential modified version of the SHR clinical measure as additional data become available. As an alternative, we considered whether we could exclude patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 from the SHR clinical measure cohort, but we determined suppression will provide us with additional time and additional months of data potentially impacted by COVID-19 to more thoroughly evaluate a broader range of alternatives. We want to ensure that the measure reflects care provided to Medicare dialysis patients and we are concerned that excluding otherwise eligible patients may not accurately reflect the care provided, particularly given the unequal distribution of COVID-19 patients across facilities and hospitals over time. As an alternative approach, we stated that we also might consider updating the specifications for the SHR clinical measure to eliminate any exposure time and events after infection for patients who contract COVID-19, as COVID-19 symptoms may continue to affect patients after infection. We stated our belief that this approach might help distinguish between ESRD-related hospitalizations and COVID-19 related hospitalizations that might otherwise impact SHR clinical measure calculations. We welcomed public comment on our proposal to suppress the SHR clinical measure for PY 2022. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposal to suppress the SHR clinical measure for PY 2022, agreeing that the COVID-19 PHE has impacted the validity and reliability of performance scoring for PY 2022. Response We thank the commenters for their support. Final Rule Action After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to suppress the SHR clinical measure for PY 2022.c. Suppression of the SRR Clinical Measure for PY 2022 In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36352 through 36353, we proposed to suppress the SRR clinical measure for the PY 2022 program year under proposed Measure Suppression Factor 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during the COVID-19 PHE, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years. The SRR assesses the number of readmission events for the patients at a facility, relative to the number of readmission events that would be expected based on overall national rates and the characteristics of the patients at that facility as well as the number of discharges. The intent of the SRR clinical measure is to improve care coordination between dialysis facilities and hospitals to improve communication prior to and post discharge. Based on our analysis, we found that index discharge hospitalizations involving dialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19 resulted in lower readmissions and higher mortality rates within the first 7 days. We used index hospitalizations occurring from January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020 to identify eligible index hospitalizations and unplanned hospital readmissions. In an analysis of unadjusted readmission and death rates by COVID-19 hospitalization status and days since index discharge, during the first 4 to 7 days after discharge there was a readmission rate of 81.3 percent of dialysis patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as compared to 82.6 percent of dialysis patients hospitalized without COVID-19. During that same 4 to 7 day time period, the unadjusted mortality rate for dialysis patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was 16.9 percent, compared with 10.9 percent of patients hospitalized without COVID-19. Based on this discrepancy, we were concerned about the effects of these observations on the calculations for the SRR clinical measure. The denominator of SRR reflects the expected number of index discharges followed by an unplanned readmission within 4 to 30 days in each facility, which is derived from a model that accounts for patient characteristics, the dialysis facility to which the patient is discharged, and the discharging acute care or critical access hospitals involved. Our analysis indicated potential competing risks of higher mortality and lower readmissions due to patient death or discharge to hospice, both of which would remove them from the denominator for the SRR clinical measure. If readmissions rates are lower because patient mortality is higher due to the impact of COVID-19 on dialysis patients, then readmission rates would be distorted by appearing significantly better compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years. Based on the impact of COVID-19 on SRR results, including the deviance in measurement, we concluded that the SRR clinical measure met our criteria for Factor 1 where performance data would significantly deviate from historical data performance and would be considered unreliable. Therefore, we stated our belief that the resulting performance measurement on the SRR clinicalPage 61916measure would not be sufficiently reliable or valid for use in the ESRD QIP. We proposed to suppress this measure for the PY 2022 program year, rather than remove it, because we believe that the SRR clinical measure is an important part of the ESRD QIP Program measure set. However, we were concerned that the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic affected measure performance on the current SRR clinical measure such that we would not be able to score facilities fairly or equitably on it. Additionally, we stated that we would continue to collect the measures claims data from participating facilities so that we could monitor the effect of the circumstances on quality measurement and determine the appropriate policies in the future. We would also continue to provide confidential feedback reports to facilities as part of program activities to ensure that they are made aware of the changes in performance rates that we observe. We also stated our intent to publicly report PY 2022 data where feasible and appropriately caveated. In the proposed rule, we stated that we were currently exploring ways to adjust effectively for the systematic effects of the COVID-19 PHE on hospital admissions for the SRR clinical measure. However, we are still working to improve these COVID-19 adjustments and verify the validity of a potential modified version of the SRR clinical measure as additional data becomes available. As an alternative approach, we stated that we might also consider eliminating from the calculation of the SRR clinical measure any cases of patients who had a COVID-19 event prior to or at the time of index hospitalization. We stated our belief this approach might help distinguish between ESRD-related readmissions and COVID-19 related readmissions that might otherwise impact SRR clinical measure calculations. We welcomed public comment on our proposal to suppress the SRR clinical measure for PY 2022. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposal to suppress the SRR clinical measure for PY 2022, agreeing that the COVID-19 PHE has impacted the validity and reliability of performance scoring for PY 2022. Response We thank the commenters for their support. Final Rule Action After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to suppress the SRR clinical measure for PY 2022.d. Suppression of the ICH CAHPS Clinical Measure for PY 2022 In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36353, we proposed to suppress the ICH CAHPS clinical measure for the PY 2022 program year under proposed Measure Suppression Factor 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during the COVID-19 PHE, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years. Based on our analysis of CY 2020 ICH CAHPS data, we found a significant decrease in response scores as compared to previous years. The ICH CAHPS clinical measure is scored based on three composite measures and three global ratings.120 Global ratings questions employ a scale of 0 to 10, worst to best each of the questions within a composite measure use either Yes or No responses, or response categories ranging from Never to Always to assess the patients experience of care at a facility. Facility performance on each composite measure is determined by the percent of patients who choose top-box responses that is, most positive or Always to the ICH CAHPS survey questions in each domain. The ICH CAHPS survey is administered twice yearly, once in the spring and once in the fall.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 120 Groupings of questions and composite measures can be found at Because of the ECE we granted in response to the COVID-19 PHE, facilities were not required to submit CY 2020 spring ICH CAHPS data for purposes of the ESRD QIP. On September 2, 2020, we published an interim final rule with comment IFC in the Federal Register titled, Medicare and Medicaid Programs, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments CLIA, and Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Additional Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency 85 FR 54820 referred to herein as the September 2020 IFC. In the September 2020 IFC, we noted that we would not use any first or second quarter CY 2020 data to calculate TPSs for the applicable performance period 85 FR 54829 through 54830. Because the PY 2022 performance period for the ICH CAHPS measure is January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and the ICH CAHPS survey is administered twice a year once in the spring and once in the fall, in the proposed rule we stated that we only have data available from the fall CY 2020 survey to calculate facility performance on this measure. Therefore, facilities would only be scored on data based on one ICH CAHPS survey administration for CY 2020, rather than two. Even if we were to score facilities based on the one ICH CAHPS survey administered in the fall, our preliminary data indicated that 95 percent of facilities would not be eligible for scoring on ICH CAHPS for CY 2020. By contrast, 58.9 percent of facilities were not eligible for ICH CAHPS during CY 2018. If we were to score the 5 percent of eligible facilities on ICH CAHPS, we stated our belief that there would be a significant deviation in national performance on this measure compared to the national performance based on 41.1 percent of facilities eligible for scoring on ICH CAHPS during 2018 86 FR 36353. We also stated that this is a significant deviation in national performance on this measure compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years. Given this significant deviation in national performance during the PHE, we expressed our belief that the ICH CAHPS clinical measure meets the criteria for Measure Suppression Factor 1. We also stated our belief that this significant change in performance may unfairly penalize facilities and that suppressing this measure for the PY 2022 program year would address concerns about the potential unintended consequences of penalizing facilities that treat COVID-19 diagnosed patients in the ESRD QIP. As alternative approaches, we considered changing the performance period or scoring facilities on one survey administration, but otherwise meeting the 30 completed surveys requirement. However, we found that neither of these approaches were feasible extending the performance period would not accurately reflect ICH CAHPS performance during CY 2020, and as discussed above, an estimated 95 percent of facilities would not be eligible for ICH CAHPS scoring on one survey. Therefore, to avoid unfairly penalizing facilities due to their performance on the ICH CAHPS survey for the PY 2022 ESRD QIP, we stated our belief that it is appropriate to suppress the ICH CAHPS measure for CY 2020, which is the performance period for the PY 2022 ESRD QIP program year 83 FR 57010. We proposed to suppress this measure for the PY 2022 program year, rather than remove it, because we believe that the ICH CAHPS measure is an important part of the ESRD QIP measure set.Page 61917However, we were concerned that the COVID-19 PHE affected measure performance on the current ICH CAHPS measure such that we would not be able to score facilities fairly or equitably on it. Additionally, participating facilities would continue to report the measures data to CMS so that we could monitor the effect of the circumstances on quality measurement and determine the appropriate policies in the future. In the proposed rule, we stated that we would also continue to provide confidential feedback reports to facilities as part of program activities to ensure that they are made aware of the changes in performance rates that we observe 86 FR 36353. We also stated our intent to publicly report PY 2022 data where feasible and appropriately caveated. We welcomed public comment on our proposal to suppress the ICH CAHPS measure for the PY 2022 program year. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposal to suppress the ICH CAHPS measure for PY 2022, agreeing that the COVID-19 PHE has impacted the validity and reliability of performance scoring for PY 2022. Response We thank the commenters for their support. Final Rule Action After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to suppress the ICH CAHPS measure for PY 2022.e. Suppression of the Long-Term Catheter Rate Clinical Measure for PY 2022 In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36353 through 36354, we proposed to suppress the Long-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure for the PY 2022 program year under proposed Measure Suppression Factor 1, Significant deviation in national performance on the measure during the COVID-19 PHE, which could be significantly better or significantly worse compared to historical performance during the immediately preceding program years. Based on our analysis of Long-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure data during CY 2020, we found a significant increase in long-term catheter use as compared to previous years, which may be the result of hesitancy to seek medical treatment among dialysis patients concerned about being exposed to COVID-19 during the PHE. In the CY 2018 ESRD PPS final rule, we finalized the inclusion of the Hemodialysis Vascular Access Long-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure in the ESRD QIP measure set beginning with the PY 2021 program 82 FR 50778. The Long-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure is defined as the percentage of adult hemodialysis patient-months using a catheter continuously for three months or longer for vascular access. The measure is based on vascular access data reported in CROWNWeb now EQRS and excludes patient-months where a patient has a catheter in place and has a limited life expectancy. Our analysis based on the available data indicated that long-term catheter use rates increased significantly during the COVID-19 PHE. Average long-term catheter rates were averaging around 12 percent in CY 2017 and CY 2018. In CY 2019, rates increased to average around 12.25 percent. This increase continued into CY 2020, with rates reaching a peak of 14.7 percent in June 2020 and declining slightly to 14.3 percent in July and August 2020. After remaining around 12 percent for 3 consecutive years, in the proposed rule we stated that we view a sudden 2 percent increase in average long-term catheter rates as a significant deviation compared to historical performance during immediately preceding years 86 FR 36354. We were concerned that the COVID-PHE impacted the ability of ESRD patients to seek treatment from medical providers regarding their catheter use, either due to difficulty accessing treatment due to COVID-19 precautions at healthcare facilities, or due to increased patient reluctance to seek medical treatment because of risk of COVID-19 exposure and increased health risks resulting therefrom, and that these contributed to the significant increase in long-term catheter use rates. We proposed to suppress this measure for the PY 2022 program year, rather than remove it, because we believe that the Long-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure is an important part of the ESRD QIP measure set. However, we were concerned that the PHE for COVID-19 affected measure performance on the current Long-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure such that we would not be able to score facilities fairly or equitably on it. Additionally, participating facilities would continue to report the measures data to CMS so that we could monitor the effect of the circumstances on quality measurement and determine the appropriate policies in the future. In the proposed rule 86 FR 36354, we stated that we would also continue to provide confidential feedback reports to facilities as part of program activities to ensure that they are made aware of the changes in performance rates that we observe. We also stated our intent to publicly report PY 2022 data where feasible and appropriately caveated. We welcomed public comment on our proposal to suppress the Long-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure for the PY 2022 program year. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposal to suppress the Long-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure for PY 2022, agreeing that the COVID-19 PHE has impacted the validity and reliability of performance scoring for PY 2022. Response We thank the commenters for their support. Final Rule Action After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to suppress the Long-Term Catheter Rate clinical measure for PY 2022.D. Special Scoring Methodology and Payment Policy for the PY 2022 ESRD QIP As described in section IV.B.2 of the proposed rule, we have considered the impact of operational systems issues preventing facilities from submitting September through December 2020 patient and clinical data into the EQRS from November 1, 2020 through on or about July 12, 2021. Even when facilities are able to submit the September through December 2020 patient and clinical data by September 1, 2021, we will need time to validate the quality and reliability of the impacted data in order to determine whether all data quality issues have been resolved 86 FR 36354. In addition, as described in section IV.C we stated our belief that four of the ESRD QIP measures have been impacted by the COVID-19 PHE that could result in distorted measure performance for PY 2022. It is not our intention to penalize dialysis facilities based on the performance on data that are not reliable, thus, not reflective of the quality of care that the measures in the program are designed to assess. Therefore, we proposed a special rule for PY 2022 scoring for the ESRD QIP under which we would calculate measure rates for all measures, but would not calculate achievement and improvement points for any of them because they have all been impacted by the operational systems issues and, as we stated previously, we believe that four of them have additionally been significantly impacted by COVID-19. Because we would not calculate achievement and improvement scores for any measures, we also proposed under this special rule that we wouldPage 61918not score any of the measures in the four domains or calculate or award Total Performance Scores for any facility. We also proposed to not apply any payment reductions to ESRD facilities for PY 2022. In order to ensure that a facility is aware of any changes to its measure rates that we have observed, we proposed to provide confidential feedback reports that contain the measure rates we calculated for PY 2022. Performance scores for facilities would be released on Dialysis Facility Compare and footnoted to indicate potential accuracy concerns with the scores. Performance score certificates would be generated with the TPS showing as Not Applicable. We proposed to codify these policies for PY 2022 at 42 CFR 413.177a and 413.178h. However, we stated that if the proposed measure suppression policies and proposed special scoring and payment policies in the proposed rule were not finalized, the PY 2022 ESRD QIP payment would be implemented in accordance with our current policy, as well as the payment reduction ranges finalized in the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule 84 FR 60725 through 60727. We invited public comment on this proposed special scoring and payment policy for the PY 2022 ESRD QIP. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Many commenters expressed support for the proposed special scoring methodology and payment policy for PY 2022. Several commenters agreed that quality measure data submitted during the COVID-19 PHE should not be used for performance scoring or payment in the ESRD QIP, and expressed their concerns regarding the impact of the COVID-19 PHE on quality measure data. Several commenters agreed that facilities should not be penalized due to the potential impact of EQRS issues on the reliability and accuracy of the data. One commenter expressed the belief that this proposal would allow staff members to remain focused on COVID-19 safety. Response We thank the commenters for their support. Comment A few commenters recommended that CMS apply this special scoring methodology and payment policy to PY 2023 and possibly future years, noting the continuing impact of the COVID-19 PHE on facilities and the ESRD patient population. A few commenters expressed the belief that it is appropriate to let the healthcare system stabilize from the effects of the PHE before imposing penalties. Response We thank the commenters for this feedback. We acknowledge the continuing impact of the COVID-19 PHE on facilities and the ESRD patient population. We will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 PHE on the ESRD QIP in order to consider, based on the data, whether to propose changes to the scoring methodology for PY 2023. Final Rule Action After considering public comments, we are finalizing our special scoring and payment policy for the PY 2022 ESRD QIP as proposed. We are also finalizing our proposal to codify these policies for PY 2022 at 42 CFR 413.177a and 413.178h.E. Updates to Requirements Beginning With the PY 2024 ESRD QIP1. PY 2024 ESRD QIP Measure Set Under our current policy, we retain all ESRD QIP measures from year to year unless we propose through rulemaking to remove them or otherwise provide notification of immediate removal if a measure raises potential safety issues 77 FR 67475. Accordingly, the PY 2024 ESRD QIP measure set will include the same 14 measures as the PY 2023 ESRD QIP measure set 85 FR 71465 through 71466. These measures were described in Table 2 in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36355 and are described in Table 2 in this final rule. For the most recent information on each measures technical specifications for PY 2024, we refer readers to the CMS ESRD Measures Manual for the 2021 Performance Period.121--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 121 We note that information for the 2022 Performance Period is also now available at CODE 4120-01-PPage 61919GRAPHIC TIFF OMITTED TR08NO21.001BILLING CODE 4120-01-C We discuss our proposal to update the SHR clinical measure in the following section.a. Update to the Standardized Hospitalization Ratio SHR Clinical Measure Beginning With the PY 2024 ESRD QIP In the CY 2017 ESRD PPS final rule, we adopted the SHR clinical measure under the authority of section 1881h2Bii of the Act 81 FR 77906 through 77911. The SHR clinical measure is a National Quality Forum NQF-endorsed all-cause, risk-standardized rate of hospitalizations during a 1-year observation window. The standardized hospitalization ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of hospital admissions that occur for Medicare ESRD dialysis patients treated at a particular facility to the number of hospitalizations that would be expectedPage 61920given the characteristics of the dialysis facilitys patients and the national norm for dialysis facilities. This measure is calculated as a ratio but can also be expressed as a rate. In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36356, we stated that hospitalizations are an important indicator of patient morbidity and quality of life. On average, dialysis patients are admitted to the hospital nearly twice a year and spend an average of 11.2 days in the hospital per year.122 Hospitalizations account for approximately 33 percent of total Medicare expenditures for ESRD patients.123 Studies have shown that improved health care delivery and care coordination may help reduce unplanned acute care including hospitalization.124 Hospitalization rates vary across dialysis facilities even after adjustment for patient characteristics, suggesting that hospitalizations might be influenced by dialysis facility practices. An adjusted facility-level standardized hospitalization ratio, accounting for differences in patients characteristics, plays an important role in identifying potential problems, and helps facilities provide cost-effective quality health care to help limit escalating medical costs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 122 United States Renal Data System. 2018 United States Renal Data System annual data report Epidemiology of kidney disease in the United States.

Advancing American Kidney Health. 2019. Available at In the CY 2017 ESRD PPS final rule, we finalized our proposal to adopt the SHR clinical measure, which was a modified version of the NQF-endorsed SHR clinical measure NQF 1463, as part of the ESRD QIP measure set 81 FR 77911. In that final rule, we stated that our modified SHR clinical measure would incorporate 210 prevalent comorbidities into our risk adjustment calculation, as our analyses suggested that incorporating prevalent comorbidities would result in a more robust and reliable measure of hospitalization 81 FR 77906 through 77907. In that final rule, we explained that data used to calculate the SHR clinical measure are derived from an extensive national ESRD patient database 81 FR 77908. We noted that the database is comprehensive for Medicare Parts A and B patients, and that non-Medicare patients are included in all sources except for the Medicare payment records. In that final rule, we also stated that the Standard Information Management SystemCROWNWeb provides tracking by dialysis provider and treatment modality for non-Medicare patients, and information on hospitalizations and patient comorbidities are obtained from Medicare Inpatient Claims Standard Analysis Files. In the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule, we increased the weight of the SHR clinical measure from 8.25 percent to 14 percent of the TPS 83 FR 56992 through 56997. On November 20, 2020, NQF completed its most recent review of the SHR clinical measure, a measure maintenance review, and renewed the measures endorsement. As part of this review, the NQF endorsed updating the prevalent comorbidity adjustment, which would group 210 individual ICD-9-CM prevalent comorbidities into 90 condition groups, derived from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ Clinical Classifications Software CCS groups. The updated prevalent comorbidity adjustment would also limit the source of prevalent comorbidities to inpatient claims. The switch to using only Medicare inpatient claims to identify prevalent comorbidities is due to the lack of Medicare outpatient claims data for the growing Medicare Advantage MA patient population. By using the original set of Medicare claims datasets inpatient, outpatient, hospice, skilled nursing, and home health, the NQF stated its concern that MA patient prevalent comorbidities would be systematically biased. These MA patient prevalent comorbidities would only be populated by Medicare inpatient claims, as compared to non-MA patient prevalent comorbidities that would be populated by the aforementioned set of Medicare claim sources. The updated NQF-endorsed SHR clinical measure would also include all time at risk for MA patients, and added a MA indicator for adjustment in the model. The NQF-endorsed specifications also included updates to parameterization of existing adjustment factors and re-evaluation of interactions, and also created three distinct groups of patients to use in the SHR model based on time spent in a skilled nursing facility, noting that nursing home residence is a marker of higher morbidity. The updated SHR clinical measure was included on the publicly available List of Measures under Consideration for December 21, 2020 MUC List, a list of measures under consideration for use in various Medicare programs.125 When the Measure Applications Partnership Hospital Workgroup convened on January 11, 2021, it reviewed the MUC List, including the SHR clinical measure. The Measure Applications Partnership Hospital Workgroup recognized that hospitalization rates vary across dialysis facilities, even after adjusting for patient characteristics, which suggests that hospitalizations might be influenced by dialysis facility practices. The Measure Applications Partnership Hospital Workgroup also noted that the SHR clinical measure seeks to improve patient outcomes by measuring hospitalization ratios among dialysis facilities, and that the measure seeks to promote communication between the dialysis facilities and other care settings to improve care transitions.126 In its final report, the Measure Applications Partnership supported this measure for rulemaking.127--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 125 National Quality Forum.

Accessed on April 28, 2021 at In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36356, we proposed to update the SHR clinical measure specifications to align with the NQF-endorsed updates. These included updates to the risk adjustment method of the measure, which include a prevalent comorbidity adjustment, the addition of MA patients and a MA indicator in the model, updates to parameterization of existing adjustment factors and re-evaluation of interactions, and an indicator for a patients time spent in a skilled nursing facility. In the proposed rule, we expressed our belief that adopting these updates would be consistent with our stated goal of evaluating opportunities to more closely align ESRD QIP measures with NQF measure specifications 84 FR 60724. The SHR clinical measure seeks to improve patient outcomes by measuring hospitalization ratios among dialysis facilities, and we stated our belief that these updates would result in a more reliable and robust SHR clinical measure. We sought comment on this proposal to update the SHR clinical measurePage 61921specifications for use in the ESRD QIP beginning with PY 2024. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment A few commenters expressed support for the proposed updates to the SHR clinical measure specifications. One commenter noted that such updates are NQF-endorsed and supported by the MAP. Response We thank the commenters for their support. Comment A few commenters expressed concern regarding the proposed updates to the risk adjustment method of the SHR clinical measure and recommended that CMS perform a sensitivity analysis of the risk model fit, comparing the prior risk models outcomes with the updated risk models performance to assess the impact of the new approach. Response We are finalizing the proposed updates to the SHR clinical measure because they are endorsed by the NQF and would align the specifications of the SHR clinical measure with the NQF-endorsed specifications. Although we are not bound by the NQFs decisions regarding measure specifications, we believe that adopting these updates is consistent with our stated goal of evaluating opportunities to more closely align ESRD QIP measures with NQF measure specifications 84 FR 60724. The updates to the SHR clinical measure were reviewed and endorsed by NQF in 2020. As part of that NQF review, both the current and proposed SHR risk adjustment model results were presented in the Testing Forms and were available for discussion during the NQF review process. In addition, the NQF review included comparisons of both the prior and updated risk adjustment model performance for other aspects of the Scientific Acceptability criteria reliability and validity. Both the NQF Methodology Panel and AdmissionsReadmissions Standing Committee had the opportunity to review the models performance that is, the risk model fit on those and other endorsement criteria prior to NQFs decision to endorse the proposed model changes. Because the NQF review included an analysis of the risk models performance, we believe that the NQF review effectively constituted a sensitivity review that is, an analysis of the degree to which the elements of the risk model contribute to the risk of hospitalization of the proposed specification changes, because it compared all important criteria used by NQF between the prior and proposed versions of SHR. Comment A few commenters expressed concern that the proposed update to the comorbidity adjustment may skew the model toward a sicker patient population, noting that the approach would result in inaccurately low hospitalization rates leading to erroneously high scores. One commenter expressed concern that this may be misleading to patients and might disincentivize improvements that might actually lower hospitalizations. Response We developed the proposed updated version of the SHR clinical measure to directly correct a progressive bias related to our prior definition of an active Medicare patient in the context of the rapid increase in Medicare chronic dialysis patients with Medicare Advantage coverage. In the prior version of the SHR clinical measure, active Medicare status was defined by use criteria. An individual patient met our use criteria if they either had 900 or more in paid Medicare outpatient dialysis claims or an acute inpatient hospitalization. Either claims-based criterion conveyed active Medicare status for purposes of the measure for the event month and two consecutive following months. Nearly all Medicare fee-for-service patients meet the use criterion of 900 paid claims for dialysis because this amount reflects between 2 to 3 outpatient dialysis treatments at current reimbursement rates. However, the only MA patients meeting these use criteria were those hospitalized in the year. As a result, the time at risk calculated in the old SHR clinical measure underestimated the time at risk for MA patients because not all are hospitalized in a year and virtually no MA patients meet the other use criterion, due to CMS lack of access to outpatient claims for MA enrollees. The proposed updated version of the SHR clinical measure currently utilizes Medicares Enrollment Database to identify Medicare Advantage patient status monthly. Combined with our patient-level treatment history file, we are able to calculate true MA patient time at risk at a given dialysis facility, without bias from the use test. For the purposes of identifying co-morbidities from Medicare Claims for risk adjustment, we use all inpatient claims in the prior calendar year. We are able to obtain inpatient claims for both Medicare fee-for-service patients as well as MA patients, as hospitals and other inpatient providers furnish inpatient claims for MA patients to their Medicare Administrative Contractors MACs for informational purposes. For beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage, those inpatient claims are often referred to as shadow claims, as they are not used for direct billing. For Medicare Fee-for Service beneficiaries, we only use paid inpatient claims. Unlike for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, CMS has virtually no access to outpatient claims for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. We no longer use outpatient claims sources to identify co-morbidities, eliminating potential bias related to the lack of access to outpatient claims for MA patients. Identification of prevalent comorbidities based on only inpatient claims results in fewer comorbidities for each patient compared to use of the universe of Medicare claims. However, use of only inpatient claims results in similar numbers and types of comorbidities for MA patients and other Medicare patients. For instance, in an analysis of a set of comorbidity groups used in a recent SRR calculation, we found that inpatient claims identified 12 comorbid conditions for MA patients on average compared to 12.4 comorbid conditions for other non-MA Medicare patients. In the revised SHR clinical measure, we use all available inpatient claims in the prior calendar year for both Fee-For-Service FFS and MA patients. While we agree that limiting co-morbidity ascertainment to inpatient claims results in a less comprehensive set of co-morbidities, our proposed updated risk-adjustment methodology protects against potential bias in determining comorbidity burden due to differences in our access to claims data for FFS and MA patients discussed above. As the SHR clinical measure relies on use of inpatient claims to identify co-morbidities in the prior calendar year, we expect that this lookback period reflects more current conditions that are more likely to be predictive of hospitalization risk. Therefore, we do not believe that outpatient claim derived co-morbidities are as clinically relevant to the risk-adjustment needed for the SHR clinical measure. Moreover, our approach does not require us to exclude MA patients from the measures. We do not want to eliminate a sizable percentage of the current observations from the SHR clinical measure, particularly given the anticipated growth of MA patients with diagnoses of ESRD that will result from changes to the MA program regulations related to the ability of prevalent ESRD patients to choose MA plans beginning in 2021, as finalized in the Medicare Program Contract Year 2021 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, and Medicare Cost Plan Program final rulePage 6192285 FR 33821 through 33824, which implemented provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act to remove the prohibition on ESRD beneficiaries enrolling in an MA plan.128 Finally, to account for potential underlying co-morbidity differences between MA and FFS patients that cannot be observed due to potentially incomplete claims-based ascertainment of health status for MA patients, we included all time at risk for Medicare Advantage patients and added a Medicare Advantage indicator for adjustment in the model.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 128 The 21st Century Cures Act Pub. L. 114-255 amended sections 1851, 1852, and 1853 of the Act to expand enrollment options for individuals with ESRD and make associated payment and coverage changes to the MA and original Medicare programs. Specifically, since the beginning of the MA program, individuals with ESRD have not been able to enroll in MA plans subject to limited exceptions. Section 17006a of the Cures Act removed this prohibition effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2021.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Regarding the possibility that the SHR risk model changes described above would increase model bias, we disagree and believe that the concern that the revised model would bias the SHR toward sicker patients is unfounded. First, we have discussed above the frequency of inpatient claims diagnoses for FFS and MA patients under the new approach. The average number of diagnoses reported from inpatient claims for FFS and MA patients are very similar, strongly suggesting that using only the inpatient claims source is an accurate reflection of the comorbidities for both patient populations. The proposed SHR risk model also includes a Medicare Advantage indicator variable in the model that would guard against bias by minimizing the potential impact of differences in unobserved comorbidities from outpatient claims sources. Considering that the proposed model eliminates a sizeable known bias related to the lack of data about outpatient claims for MA patients, we believe the proposed SHR risk model provides a more accurate representation of dialysis facility performance and, therefore, utility to the dialysis community. Comment A few commenters expressed concern regarding the parameterization modifications of existing adjustment factors included in the proposed updates to the SHR clinical measure. Although a few commenters agreed that the updated parameterization of existing adjustment factors and reevaluation of interactions is important, they expressed concern that the p-values, or calculated probability values, of SHR risk models indicate that the model would not be generalizable. Response We believe that the proposed risk adjustment model, which includes updates to the parameterization of existing adjustment factors that is, modifying the functional forms of adjustment factors and re-evaluation of interactions, is more appropriate because it captures all Medicare patients. Since we are only using the SHR risk models for purposes of the SHR clinical measure, we believe that generalizability is not an issue. Comment One commenter requested that CMS indicate how Medicare Advantage patients will be identified under the proposed SHR measure specifications. Response Medicare Advantage patient status will be obtained from the Medicare Enrollment Database EDB. We will confirm the presence of usable ICD diagnosis codes from MA inpatient claims. Comment A few commenters recommended that the ESRD QIP should use true risk-standardized rate measures in order to more accurately reflect facility performance, as the ratio measures have relatively wide confidence intervals that can lead to facilities being misclassified and their actual performance not being reported. One commenter expressed the belief that a more direct, transparent, risk-adjusted rate measure would result in more significant improvement, noting that ESRD patient hospitalization rates have increased between 2016 and 2018 and questioned whether the SHR clinical measure has had a meaningful impact. Response We believe that the use of a ratio is appropriate for the SHR clinical measure. The ratio estimate that we proposed is the ratio of the facility adjusted rate to the standard rate. The ratio is also a scientifically valid approach, and ratio measures are well accepted in the published literature. Additionally, the risk-adjustment approach which is based on application of a specific risk-adjustment model currently used for the SHR, SRR, and SWR measures leads naturally to a standardized ratio, which compares the rate for this facility with the national rate, having adjusted for the patient mix and is relatively straightforward. We do not believe that rates are more direct and transparent than ratios, and we disagree with the commenter who stated that a risk-adjusted rate measure would lead to significant improvement in performance on the SHR clinical measure. Like ratios, risk-adjusted rates are not the same as actual rates and require a consideration of the patient mix adjustment for interpretation. Furthermore, because the indirect standardized rate is equal to the multiplication of the indirect standardized ratio and a national rate, where the national rate is a constant for all facilities, classifications of facilities based on indirect standardized ratios and rates are equivalent. Finally, we disagree that hospitalization rates have increased between 2016 and 2018. Hospitalization rates have decreased since 2015 as evidenced by the negative coefficients for calendar year from the SHR model. The hospitalization rate for 2016 decreased by 2.7 percent compared to 2015 p-value lt0.0001. Subsequent years had a larger decrease in the hospitalization rate compared to 2015 at 6.8 percent lower for 2017 and about 5.7 percent lower for 2018 p-valuelt0.0001 for both compared to 2015. Although 2018 had a slightly higher rate than 2017, there is an overall downward trend. Final Rule Action After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to update the SHR clinical measure specifications for use in the ESRD QIP beginning with PY 2024.2. Performance Standards for the PY 2024 ESRD QIP Section 1881h4A of the Act requires the Secretary to establish performance standards with respect to the measures selected for the ESRD QIP for a performance period with respect to a year. The performance standards must include levels of achievement and improvement, as required by section 1881h4B of the Act, and must be established prior to the beginning of the performance period for the year involved, as required by section 1881h4C of the Act. We refer readers to the CY 2013 ESRD PPS final rule 76 FR 70277 for a discussion of the achievement and improvement standards that we have established for clinical measures used in the ESRD QIP. We define the terms achievement threshold, benchmark, improvement threshold, and performance standard in our regulations at Sec. 413.178a1, 3, 7, and 12, respectively.a. Update to the Performance Standards Applicable to the PY 2024 Clinical Measures Our current policy is to automatically adopt a performance and baseline period for each year that is 1 year advanced from those specified for the previous payment year 84 FR 60728. Under this policy, CY 2022 is currently the performance period and CY 2020 is the baseline period for the PY 2024 ESRD QIP. However, under the nationwide ECE that we granted inPage 61923response to the COVID-19 PHE, first and second quarter data for CY 2020 are excluded from scoring for purposes of the ESRD QIP. In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36357, we stated that we were concerned that it would be difficult to assess levels of achievement and improvement if the performance standards were based on partial year data.129 Our preliminary analysis indicated that the effect of the excluded data would create higher performance standards for certain measures and lower performance standards for other measures, which may skew achievement and improvement thresholds for facilities and therefore may result in performance standards that do not accurately reflect levels of achievement and improvement.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 129 We note that for most ESRD QIP measures, this partial year data would be measure data from July and August 2020.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our current policy substitutes the performance standard, achievement threshold, andor benchmark for a measure for a performance year if final numerical values for the performance standard, achievement threshold, andor benchmark are worse than the numerical values for that measure in the previous year of the ESRD QIP 82 FR 50764. We stated in the proposed rule that we adopted this policy because we believe that the ESRD QIP should not have lower performance standards than in previous years 86 FR 36357. However, our general policy provides flexibility to substitute the performance standard, achievement threshold, and benchmark in appropriate cases 82 FR 50764. Although the lower performance standards would be substituted with those from the prior year, the higher performance standards would be used to set performance standards for certain measures, even though they would be based on partial year data. In the proposed rule 86 FR 36357, we stated that we were concerned that this may create performance standards for certain measures that would be difficult for facilities to attain with a full 12 months of data. Therefore, in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36357, we proposed to calculate the performance standards for PY 2024 using CY 2019 data, which are the most recently available full calendar year of data we can use to calculate those standards. Due to the impact of CY 2020 data that are excluded from the ESRD QIP for scoring purposes, we stated our belief that using CY 2019 data for performance standard setting purposes is appropriate. Consistent with our established policy, we would continue to use the prior years numerical values for performance standard, achievement threshold, and benchmark if the most recent full CYs final numerical values are worse. We welcomed public comments on this proposal. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposed use of CY 2019 data for calculating performance standards, achievement thresholds, and benchmarks for PY 2024. A few commenters noted that the significant impact of the COVID-19 PHE would make CY 2020 measure data inappropriate for setting PY 2024 performance standards. A few commenters supported the proposal because CY 2019 is the most recently available full calendar year of data. Response We thank the commenters for their support. Comment One commenter expressed concern with the proposed use of CY 2019 data for calculating performance standards, achievement thresholds, and benchmarks for PY 2024, noting that the ongoing COVID-19 PHE continues to impact measure performance and that using CY 2019 as a pre-pandemic baseline for setting performance standards may unfairly penalize facilities. Response We acknowledge the commenters concern regarding the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 PHE, but disagree that using CY 2019 data for calculating performance standards will unfairly penalize facilities. We note that, due to the nationwide ECE granted in response to the COVID-19 PHE that excluded first and second quarter data from CY 2020, only 6 months of CY 2020 data would be used to calculate performance standards, achievement thresholds, and benchmarks for PY 2024. We believe that there is a greater risk of unfairly penalizing facilities based on performance standards calculated using only 6 months of CY 2020 data, as our preliminary analysis indicated that the effect of the excluded data would create higher performance standards for certain measures and lower performance standards for other measures which may not accurately reflect levels of achievement and improvement. Comment One commenter expressed concern that the proposed update only addresses achievement scores, and requested that CMS clarify what year improvement scores will be based on. Response We proposed to use CY 2019 data to calculate all performance standards for PY 2024, including achievement and improvement thresholds. This is consistent with the definition of performance standards codified at 42 CFR 413.178a12, which includes all of the performance levels used to award points to a facility. Therefore, the improvement scores will be calculated using CY 2019 as the baseline year. Final Rule Action After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal to calculate the performance standards for PY 2024 using CY 2019 data.b. Finalized Performance Standards for the PY 2024 ESRD QIP Table 3 displays the achievement thresholds, 50th percentiles of the national performance, and benchmarks for the PY 2024 clinical measures, and in the proposed rule we stated that we would use these standards if our proposal to use CY 2019 as the baseline period is finalized 86 FR 36357. As discussed in IV.E.2.a of this final rule, we are finalizing our proposal to calculate the performance standards for the PY 2024 ESRD QIP using CY 2019 data.BILLING CODE 4120-01-PPage 61924GRAPHIC TIFF OMITTED TR08NO21.002 In addition, we summarize in Table 4 existing requirements for successful reporting on reporting measures in the PY 2024 ESRD QIP. We did not make any proposals to change these standards as a result of the COVID-19 PHE.Page 61925GRAPHIC TIFF OMITTED TR08NO21.0033. Eligibility Requirements for the PY 2024 ESRD QIP Our current minimum eligibility requirements for scoring the ESRD QIP measures are described in Table 5.Page 61926GRAPHIC TIFF OMITTED TR08NO21.0044. Payment Reduction Scale for the PY 2024 ESRD QIP Under our current policy, a facility will not receive a payment reduction for a payment year in connection with its performance for the ESRD QIP if it achieves a TPS that is at or above the minimum TPS mTPS that we establish for the payment year. We have defined the mTPS in our regulations at Sec. 413.178a8 as, with respect to a payment year, the TPS that an ESRD facility would receive if, during the baseline period it performed at the 50th percentile of national performance on all clinical measures and the median of national ESRD facility performance on all reporting measures. Our current policy, which is codified at Sec. 413.177 of our regulations, also implements the payment reductions on a sliding scale using ranges that reflect payment reduction differentials of 0.5 percent for each 10 points that the facilitys TPS falls below the mTPS 76 FR 634 through 635. For PY 2024, based on available data, a facility must meet or exceed a mTPS of 57 in order to avoid a payment reduction. We note that the mTPS in this final rule is based on data from CY 2019 because we are finalizing our proposal to calculate the performance standards using CY 2019 data. We refer readers to Table 3 of this final rule for the finalized values of the 50th percentile of national performance for each clinical measure. We stated in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule that under our current policy, a facility that achieves a TPS of 56 or below would receive a payment reduction based on the TPS ranges indicated in Table 6 86 FR 36360 through 36361. Table 6 of this final rule is a reproduction of Table 6 from the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule without any changes.Page 61927GRAPHIC TIFF OMITTED TR08NO21.005BILLING CODE 4120-01-C In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36361, we stated that if we did not finalize the proposed update to our performance standards policy as described in the proposed rule 86 FR 36357, then we would update the mTPS for PY 2024, as well as the payment reduction ranges for that payment year, in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS final rule using data from CY 2020. However, as discussed in section IV.E.2.a of this final rule, we are finalizing as proposed the update to our performance standards for PY 2024, and therefore we will use the mTPS and payment reduction ranges for PY 2024 that are described in Table 6.F. Updates for the PY 2025 ESRD QIP1. Continuing Measures for the PY 2025 ESRD QIP Under our previously adopted policy, the PY 2024 ESRD QIP measure set will also be used for PY 2025. We did not propose to adopt any new measures beginning with the PY 2025 ESRD QIP.2. Performance Period for the PY 2025 ESRD QIP We continue to believe that 12-month performance and baseline periods provide us sufficiently reliable quality measure data for the ESRD QIP. Under this policy, we would adopt CY 2023 as the performance period and CY 2021 as the baseline period for the PY 2025 ESRD QIP. We did not propose any changes to this policy.3. Performance Standards for the PY 2025 ESRD QIP Section 1881h4A of the Act requires the Secretary to establish performance standards with respect to the measures selected for the ESRD QIP for a performance period with respect to a year. The performance standards must include levels of achievement and improvement, as required by section 1881h4B of the Act, and must be established prior to the beginning of the performance period for the year involved, as required by section 1881h4C of the Act. We refer readers to the CY 2012 ESRD PPS final rule 76 FR 70277 for a discussion of the achievement and improvement standards that we have established for clinical measures used in the ESRD QIP. We define the terms achievement threshold, benchmark, improvement threshold, and performance standard in our regulations at Sec. 413.178a1, 3, 7, and 12, respectively. In section IV.E.2.a of this final rule, we note that we are finalizing our proposal to use CY 2019 data for purposes of calculating the performance standards for PY 2024 because, due to the anticipated impact of CY 2020 data that is excluded from the ESRD QIP for scoring purposes during CY 2020, we believe that using CY 2019 data for performance standard setting purposes would be appropriate.a. Performance Standards for Clinical Measures in the PY 2025 ESRD QIP At this time, we do not have the necessary data to assign numerical values to the achievement thresholds, benchmarks, and 50th percentiles of national performance for the clinical measures for the PY 2025 ESRD QIP because we do not have CY 2021 data. We intend to publish these numerical values, using CY 2021 data, in the CY 2023 ESRD PPS final rule.b. Performance Standards for the Reporting Measures in the PY 2025 ESRD QIP In the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule, we finalized the continued use of existing performance standards for the Screening for Clinical Depression and Follow-Up reporting measure, the Ultrafiltration Rate reporting measure, the NHSN Dialysis Event reporting measure, and the MedRec reporting measure 83 FR 57010 through 57011. In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36361, we stated that we will continue use of these performance standards in PY 2025.4. Scoring the PY 2025 ESRD QIPa. Scoring Facility Performance on Clinical Measures In the CY 2014 ESRD PPS final rule, we finalized policies for scoring performance on clinical measures based on achievement and improvement 78 FR 72215 through 72216. In the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule, we finalized a policy to continue use of this methodology for future payment years 83 FR 57011 and we codified these scoring policies at Sec. 413.178e. We did not propose any changes to this policy for PY 2025.b. Scoring Facility Performance on Reporting Measures Our policy for scoring performance on reporting measures is codified at Sec. 413.178e, and more information on our scoring policy for reporting measures can be found in the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule 84 FR 60728. We previously finalized policies for scoring performance on the NHSN Dialysis Event reporting measure in the CY 2018 ESRD PPS final rule 82 FR 50780 through 50781, as well as policies for scoring the MedRec reporting measure and Clinical Depression Screening and Follow-up reporting measure in the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule 83 FR 57011. We also previously finalized the scoring policy for the STrR reporting measure in the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule 84 FR 60721 through 60723. In the CY 2021 ESRD PPS final rule, we finalized our updated scoring methodology for the Ultrafiltration Rate reporting measure 85 FR 71468 through 71470. We did not propose any changes to these policies for PY 2025.Page 619285. Weighting the Measure Domains and the TPS for PY 2025 Under our current policy, we assign the Patient amp Family Engagement Measure Domain a weight of 15 percent of the TPS, the Care Coordination Measure Domain a weight of 30 percent of the TPS, the Clinical Care Measure Domain a weight of 40 percent of the TPS, and the Safety Measure domain a weight of 15 percent of the TPS. In the CY 2019 ESRD PPS final rule, we finalized a policy to assign weights to individual measures and a policy to redistribute the weight of unscored measures 83 FR 57011 through 57012. In the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule, we finalized a policy to use the measure weights we finalized for PY 2022 for the PY 2023 ESRD QIP and subsequent payment years, and also to use the PY 2022 measure weight redistribution policy for the PY 2023 ESRD QIP and subsequent payment years 84 FR 60728 through 60729. We did not propose any updates to these policies for PY 2025.G. Requests for Information RFIs on Topics Relevant to ESRD QIP1. Closing the Health Equity Gap in CMS Quality Programs Request for Information Persistent inequities in health care outcomes exist in the United States U.S , including among Medicare patients. In recognition of persistent health disparities and the importance of closing the health equity gap, in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule we requested information on expanding several related CMS programs to make reporting of health disparities based on social risk factors and race and ethnicity, and disability more comprehensive and actionable for dialysis facilities, providers, and patients 86 FR 36362 through 36369. The RFI that was included in the proposed rule is part of an ongoing effort across CMS to evaluate appropriate initiatives to reduce health disparities. Feedback will be used to inform the creation of a future, comprehensive, RFI focused on closing the health equity gap in CMS programs and policies. This RFI contained four parts Background. This section provided information on existing statements describing our commitment to health equity, and existing initiatives with an emphasis on reducing disparity. Current CMS Disparity Methods. This section described the methods, measures, and indicators of social risk currently used with the CMS Disparity Methods. Future potential stratification of quality measure results. This section described four potential future expansions of the CMS Disparity Methods, including a Future potential stratification of quality measure results by dual eligibility b Future potential stratification of quality measure results by race and ethnicity c Improving Demographic Data Collection and d Potential Creation of an ESRD Facility Equity Score to Synthesize Results Across Multiple Social Risk Factors. Solicitation of public comment. This section specified 11 requests for feedback on these topics. We reviewed feedback on these topics and note our intention for an additional RFI or rulemaking on this topic in the future.a. Background Significant and persistent inequities in health care outcomes exist in the U.S 130 Belonging to a racial or ethnic minority group, living with a disability, being a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer LGBTQ community, living in a rural area, or being near or below the poverty level, is often associated with worse health outcomes.131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 Such disparities in health outcomes are the result of number of factors, but importantly for CMS programs, although not the sole determinant, poor access and provision of lower quality health care contribute to health disparities. For instance, numerous studies have shown that among Medicare beneficiaries, racial and ethnic minority individuals often receive lower quality of care, report lower experiences of care, and experience more frequent hospital readmissions and operative complications.139 140 141 142 143 144 Readmission rates for common conditions in the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program are higher for Black Medicare beneficiaries and higher for Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries with Congestive Heart Failure and Acute Myocardial Infarction.145 146 147 148 149 Although Black Americans represent 7.5 percent of all older adult Medicare beneficiaries, they represent 28 percent of those with ESRD.150 Among individuals with ESRD the odds of 30-day hospital readmission are 19 percent higher for Black beneficiaries as compared with white beneficiaries.151 Studies have also shown that African Americans are significantly more likely than white Americans to die prematurely from heart disease andPage 61929stroke.152 The COVID-19 pandemic has further illustrated many of these longstanding health inequities with higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality among Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons relative to white persons.153 154 In the ESRD patient population, one study found that the rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations among dialysis patients peaked at 40 times higher than the rate in the general population during the pandemic, with Black, Latino, and Asian persons hospitalized at a higher rate than white persons.155 As noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put many people from racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19.156 One important strategy for addressing these important inequities is by improving data collection to allow for better measurement and reporting on equity across our programs and policies.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 130 United States Department of Health and Human Services.

The CMS Equity Plan for Improving Quality in Medicare outlines a path to equity which aims to support Quality Improvement Networks and Quality Improvement Organizations QIN-QIOs Federal, State, local, and tribal organizations providers researchers policymakers beneficiaries and their families and other stakeholders in activities to achieve health equity.159 The CMS Equity Plan for Improving Quality in Medicare focuses on three core priority areas which inform our policies and programs 1 Increasing understanding and awareness of disparities 2 developing and disseminating solutions to achieve health equity and 3 implementing sustainable actions to achieve health equity.160 The CMS Quality Strategy 161 and Meaningful Measures Framework 162 include elimination of racial and ethnic disparities as a central principle. Our efforts aimed at closing the health equity gap to date have included both providing transparency of health disparities, supporting providers with evidence-informed solutions to achieve health equity, and reporting to providers on gaps in quality in the following--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 159 Centers for Medicare amp Medicaid Services Office of Minority Health.

Available at The CMS Disparity Methods which provide hospital-level confidential results stratified by dual eligibility for condition-specific readmission measures currently included in the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program see 84 FR 42496 through 42500 for a discussion of using stratified data in additional measures. These programs are informed by reports by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine NASEM 168 and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation ASPE 169 which have examined the influence of social risk factors on several of our quality programs. In this request for public comment, we addressed only the eighth initiative listed above, the CMS Disparity Methods, which we have implemented for measures in the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program and are considering in other programs, including the ESRD QIP. We discussed the implementation of these methods to date and presented considerations for continuing to improve and expand these methods to provide providers and ultimately consumers with actionable information on disparities in health care quality to support efforts at closing the equity gap.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 168 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Accounting for Social Risk Factors in Medicare Payment Identifying Social Risk Factors. Washington, DC The National Academies Press. 169 Current CMS Disparity Methods We first sought public comment on potential confidential and public reporting of ESRD QIP measure data stratified by social risk factors in the CY 2018 ESRD PPS proposed rule 82 FR 31202. We initially focused on stratification by dual eligibility, which is consistent with recommendations from ASPEs First Report to Congress which was required by the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation IMPACT Act of 2014 Pub. L. 113-185.170 This report found that in the context of value-based purchasing VBP programs, dual eligibility was among the most powerful predictors of poor health outcomes among those social risk factors that ASPE examined and tested.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 170 In the FY 2018 IPPSLTCH PPS final rule, we also solicited feedback on two potential methods for illuminating differences in outcomes rates among patient groups within a providers patient population that would also allow for a comparison of those differences, or disparities, across providers for the Hospital IQR Program 82 FR 38403 through 38409. The first method the Within-Hospital disparity method promotes quality improvement by calculating differences in outcome rates among patient groups within a hospital while accounting for their clinical risk factors. This method also allows for a comparison of the magnitude of disparity across hospitals, so hospitals could assess how well they are closing disparity gaps compared to other hospitals. The second methodological approach the Across-Hospital method is complementary and assesses hospitals outcome rates for dual-eligible patients only, across hospitals, allowing for a comparison among hospitals on their performance caring for their patients with social risk factors. In the CY 2018 ESRD PPS proposed rule 82 FR 31202 through 31203, we also specifically solicited feedback on which social risk factors provide the most valuable information to stakeholders. In addition, feedback was solicited on the methodology for illuminating differences in outcomes rates among patient groups within a providers patient population that would also allow for a comparison of those differences, or disparities, across providers. Overall, comments supported the use of dual eligibility as a proxy for social risk, although commenters also suggested investigation of additional social risk factors, and we continue to consider commenter suggestions for which risk factors provide the most valuable information to stakeholders.c. Future Potential Expansion of the CMS Disparity Methods to the ESRD QIP We are committed to advancing health equity by improving data collection to better measure and analyze disparities across programs and policies.171 As we previously noted, we have been considering, among other things, expanding our efforts to provide stratified data for additional social risk factors and measures, optimizing the ease-of-use of the results, enhancing public transparency of equity results, and building towards provider accountability for health equity. We sought public comment on the potential stratification of quality measures in the ESRD QIP across two social risk factors dual eligibility and raceethnicity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 171 Centers for Medicare amp Medicaid Services. CMS Quality Strategy. 2016. Stratification of Quality Measure Results--Dual Eligibility As described in the previous section, landmark reports by NASEM 172 and ASPE,173 which have examined the influence of social risk factors on several of our quality programs, have shown that in the context of VBP programs, dual eligibility, as an indicator of social risk, is a powerful predictor of poor health outcomes. We are considering stratification of quality measure results in the ESRD QIP and are considering which measures would be most appropriate for stratification and if dual eligibility would be a meaningful social risk factor for stratification.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 172 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Accounting for Social Risk Factors in Medicare Payment Identifying Social Risk Factors. Washington, DC The National Academies Press. 173 For the ESRD QIP, we would consider disparity reporting using two disparity methods derived from the Within-Facility and Across-Facility methods. The first method based on the Within-Hospital disparity method, described previously would aim to promote quality improvement by calculating differences in outcome rates between dual and non-dual eligible patient groups within a facility while accounting for their clinical risk factors. This method would allow for a comparison of those differences, or disparities, across facilities, so facilities could assess how well they are closing disparity gaps compared to other facilities. The second approach based on the Across-Hospital method would be complementary and assesses facilities outcome rates for subgroups of patients, such as dual eligible patients, across facilities, allowing for a comparison among facilities on their performance caring for their patients with social risk factors.2 Stratification of Quality Measure Results--Race and Ethnicity The Administrations Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved CommunitiesPage 61931Through the Federal Government directs agencies to assess potential barriers that underserved communities and individuals may face to enrollment in and access to benefits and services in Federal programs. As summarized earlier in the preamble, studies have shown that among Medicare beneficiaries, racial and ethnic minority persons often experience worse health outcomes, including more frequent hospital readmissions and procedural complications.174 We also note that the prevalence of ESRD is higher among racial minorities.175 For example, in 2016 ESRD prevalence was approximately 9.5 times greater in Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, 3.7 times greater in African Americans, 1.5 times greater in American Indians and Alaska Natives, and 1.3 times greater in Asians.176 An important part of identifying and addressing inequities in health care is improving data collection to allow us to better measure and report on equity across our programs and policies. We are considering stratification of quality measure results in the ESRD QIP by race and ethnicity, and are identifying which measures would be most appropriate for stratification.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 174 175 United States Renal Data System. 2018 Annual Data Report ESRD Incidence, Prevalence, Patient Characteristics, and Treatment Modalities. Available online at 176 United States Renal Data System. 2018 Annual Data Report, Vol 2, Figure 1.12 Available online at As outlined in the 1997 Office of Management and Budget OMB Revisions to the Standards for the Collection of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity, the racial and ethnic categories which may be used for reporting the disparity methods are considered to be social and cultural, not biological or genetic.177 The 1997 OMB Standard lists five minimum categories of race 1 AmericanIndian or Alaska Native 2 Asian 3 Black or African American 4 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 5 and White. In the OMB standards, Hispanic or Latino is the only ethnicity category included, and since race and ethnicity are two separate and distinct concepts, persons who report themselves as Hispanic or Latino can be of any race.178 Another example, the Race amp Ethnicity--CDC code system in Public Health Information Network PHIN Vocabulary Access and Distribution Systems VADS 179 permits a much more granular structured recording of a patients race and ethnicity with its inclusion of over 900 concepts for race and ethnicity. The recording and exchange of patient race and ethnicity at such a granular level can facilitate the accurate identification and analysis of health disparities based on race and ethnicity. Further, the Race amp Ethnicity--CDC code system has a hierarchy that rolls up to the OMB minimum categories for race and ethnicity and, thus, supports aggregation and reporting using the OMB standard. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology ONC includes both the CDC and OMB standards in its criterion for certified health IT products.180 For race and ethnicity, a certified health IT product must be able to express both detailed races and ethnicities using any of the 900 plus concepts in the Race amp Ethnicity--CDC code system in PHIN VADS, as well as aggregate each one of a patients races and ethnicities to the categories in the OMB standard for race and ethnicity. This approach can reduce burden on providers recording demographics using certified products.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 177 Executive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.

However, historical inaccuracies in Federal data systems and limited collection classifications have contributed to the limited quality of race and ethnicity information in our administrative data systems.181 In recent decades, to address these data quality issues, we have undertaken numerous initiatives, including updating data taxonomies and conducting direct mailings to some beneficiaries to enable more comprehensive race and ethnic identification.182 183 Despite those efforts, studies reveal varying data accuracy in identification of racial and ethnic groups in Medicare administrative data, with higher sensitivity for correctly identifying white and Black individuals, and lower sensitivity for correctly identifying individuals of Hispanic ethnicity or of AsianPacific Islander and AmericanIndianAlaskan Native race.184 Incorrectly classified race or ethnicity may result in overestimation or underestimation in the quality of care received by certain groups of beneficiaries.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 181 Eicheldinger, C., amp Bonito, A. 2008.

We continue to work with public and private partners to better collect and leverage data on social risk to improve our understanding of how these factors can be better measured in order to close the health equity gap. Among other things, we have developed an Inventory of Resources for Standardized Demographic and Language Data Collection 185 and supported collection of specialized International Classification of Disease, 10th Edition, Clinical Modification ICD-10-CM codes for describing the socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental determinants of health, and sponsored several initiatives to statistically estimate race and ethnicity information when it is absent.186--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 185 Centers for Medicare amp Medicaid Services.

In working with our contractors, two algorithms have been developed to indirectly estimate the race and ethnicity of Medicare beneficiaries as described further in the next section. We believe that using indirect estimation can help to overcome the current limitations of demographic information and enable timelier reporting of equity results until longer term collaborations to improve demographic data quality across the health care sector materialize. The use of indirectly estimated race and ethnicity for conducting stratified reporting does not place any additional collection or reporting burdens on facilities as these data are derived using existing administrative and Census-linked data. Indirect estimation relies on a statistical imputation method for inferring a missing variable or improving an imperfect administrative variable using a related set of information that is more readily available.188 Indirectly estimated data are most commonly used at the population level such as the facility or health plan-level, where aggregated results form a more accurate description of the population than existing, imperfect data sets. These methods often estimate race and ethnicity using a combination of other data sources which are predictive of self-identified race and ethnicity, such as language preference, information about race and ethnicity in our administrative records, first and last names matched to validated lists of names correlated to specific national origin groups, and the racial and ethnic composition of the surrounding neighborhood. Indirect estimation has been used in other settings to support population-based equity measurement when self-identified data are not available.189--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 188 IOM. 2009.

Washington, DC The National Academies Press.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- As discussed earlier in the preamble, we have previously supported the development of two such methods of indirect estimation of race and ethnicity of Medicare beneficiaries. One indirect estimation approach, developed by our contractor, uses Medicare administrative data, first name and surname matching, derived from the U.S Census and other sources, with beneficiary language preference, State of residence, and the source of the race and ethnicity code in Medicare administrative data to reclassify some beneficiaries as Hispanic or Asian Pacific Islander API.190 In recent years, we have also worked with another contractor to develop a new approach, the Medicare Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding MBISG, which combines Medicare administrative data, first and surname matching, geocoded residential address linked to the 2010 U.S Census, and uses both Bayesian updating and multinomial logistic regression to estimate the probability of belonging to each of six racialethnic groups.191--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 190 Eicheldinger, C., amp Bonito, A. 2008.

Rockville, MD, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. January 2008.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- However, despite the high degree of statistical accuracy of the indirect estimation algorithms under consideration there remains the small risk of unintentionally introducing bias. For example, if the indirect estimation is not as accurate in correctly estimating race and ethnicity in certain geographies or populations it could lead to some bias in the method results. Such bias might result in slight overestimation or underestimation of the quality of care received by a given group. We believe this amount of bias is considerably less than would be expected if stratified reporting was conducted using the race and ethnicity currently contained in our administrative data. Indirect estimation of race and ethnicity is envisioned as an intermediate step, filling the pressing need for more accurate demographic information for the purposes of exploring inequities in service delivery, while allowing newer approaches, as described in the next section, for enhancing demographic data collection. We expressed interest in learning more about, and solicited comments about, the potential benefits and challenges associated with measuring facility equity using an imputation algorithm to enhance existing administrative data quality for race and ethnicity until self-reported information is sufficiently available.3 Improving Demographic Data Collection Stratified facility-level reporting using indirectly estimated race and ethnicity and dual eligibility would represent an important advance in our ability to provide equity reports to facilities. However, self-reported disability status, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity data remain the gold standard for classifying an individual according to disability status, race, or ethnicity. The CMS Quality Strategy outlines our commitment to strengthening infrastructure and data systems by ensuring that standardized demographic information is collected to identify disparities in health care delivery outcomes.196 Collection andPage 61933sharing of a standardized set of social, psychological, and behavioral data by facilities, including disability status and race and ethnicity, using electronic data definitions which permit nationwide, interoperable health information exchange, can significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of our equity reporting.197 This could potentially include expansion to additional social risk factors, such as language preference and disability status, where accuracy of administrative data is currently limited. We are mindful that additional resources, including data collection and staff training may be necessary to ensure that conditions are created whereby all patients are comfortable answering all demographic questions, and that individual preferences for non-response are maintained.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 196 The Centers for Medicare amp Medicaid Services. CMS Quality Strategy. 2016. 197 The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. United State Core Data for Interoperability Draft Version 2. 2021. We are also interested in learning about and solicited comments on current data collection practices by facilities to capture demographic data elements such as race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation and gender identity SOGI, language preference, and disability status. Further, we are interested in potential challenges facing facility collection of a minimum set of demographic data elements in alignment with national data collection standards such as the standards finalized by the Affordable Care Act 198 and standards for interoperable exchange such as the U.S Core Data for Interoperability put forth by ONC for incorporation in certified health IT products as part of the 2015 Edition of health IT certification criteria 199. Advancing data interoperability through collection of a minimum set of demographic data collection has the potential for improving the robustness of the disparity methods results, potentially permitting reporting using more accurate, self-reported, information, such as race and ethnicity, and expanding reporting to additional dimensions of equity, including stratified reporting by disability status.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 198 199 Potential Creation of an ESRD Facility Equity Score To Synthesize Results Across Multiple Social Risk Factors As we describe previously, we are considering expanding the disparity methods to include two social risk factors dual eligibility and raceethnicity. This approach would improve the comprehensiveness of health equity information provided to facilities. Aggregated results from multiple measures and multiple social risk factors, from the CMS Disparity Methods, in the format of a summary score, can improve the usefulness of the equity results. In working with our contractors, we recently developed an equity summary score for Medicare Advantage contractplans, the Health Equity Summary Score HESS, with application to stratified reporting using two social risk factors Dual eligibility and race and as described in Incentivizing Excellent Care to At-Risk Groups with a Health Equity Summary Score.200--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 200 Agniel D, Martino SC, Burkhart Q, et al. Incentivizing Excellent Care to At-Risk Groups with a Health Equity Summary Score. J Gen Intern Med. Published online November 11, 2019 Nov 11. doi 10.1007s11606-019-05473-x.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The HESS calculates standardized and combined performance scores blended across the two social risk factors. The HESS also combines results of the within-plan similar to the Within-Facility method and across-plan method similar to the Across-Facility method across multiple performance measures. We are considering building an ESRD Facility Equity Score, not yet developed, which would be modeled off the HESS but adapted to the context of risk-adjusted facility outcome measures and potentially other ESRD QIP quality measures. We envision that the ESRD Facility Equity Score would synthesize results for a range of measures and using multiple social risk factors, using measures and social risk factors which would be reported to facilities as part of the CMS Disparity Methods. We believe that creation of the ESRD Facility Equity Score has the potential to supplement the overall measure data already reporting on the Care Compare or successor website, by providing easy to interpret information regarding disparities measured within individual facilities and across facilities nationally. A summary score would decrease burden by minimizing the number of measure results provided and providing an overall indicator of equity. The ESRD Facility Equity Score under consideration would potentially Summarize facility performance across multiple social risk factors initially dual eligibility and indirectly estimated race and ethnicity, as described above. Summarize facility performance across the two disparity methods that is, the Within-Facility Disparity Method and the Across-Facility Disparity Method and potentially multiple measures. Prior to any future public reporting of stratified measure data using indirectly estimated race and ethnicity information, if we determine that an ESRD Facility Equity Score can be feasibly and accurately calculated, we would provide results of the ESRD Facility Equity Score, in confidential facility specific reports which facilities and their ESRD Networks would be able to download. Any potential future proposal to display the ESRD Facility Equity Score on the Care Compare or successor website would be made through future RFI or rulemaking.d. Solicitation of Public Comment We sought comment on the possibility of stratifying ESRD QIP measures by dual eligibility and race and ethnicity. We solicited public comments on the application of the within-facility or across-facility disparities methods if we were to stratify ESRD QIP measures. We also sought comment on the possibility of facility collection of standardized demographic information for the purposes of potential future quality reporting and measure stratification. In addition, we sought comment on the potential design of a facility equity score for calculating results across multiple social risk factors and measures, including race and disability. Any data pertaining to these areas that are recommended for collection for measure reporting for a CMS program and any potential public disclosure on Care Compare or successor website would be addressed through a separate and future notice-and-comment rulemaking. We plan to continue working with ASPE, facilities, the public, and other key stakeholders on this important issue to identify policy solutions that achieve the goals of attaining health equity for all patients and minimizing unintended consequences. We noted for readers that responses to the RFI will not directly impact payment decisions. We also noted our intention for additional RFI or rulemaking on this topic in the future. Specifically, we invited public comment on the followingPage 61934Future Potential Stratification of Quality Measure Results The possible stratification of facility-specific reports for ESRD QIP measure data by dual-eligibility status, including which measures would be most appropriate for stratification The potential future application of indirect estimation of race and ethnicity information to permit stratification of measure data for reporting ESRD facility-level disparity results Appropriate privacy safeguards with respect to data produced from the indirect estimation of race and ethnicity to ensure that such data is properly identified ifwhen it is shared with facilities. Ways to address the challenges of defining and collecting, accurate and standardized self-identified demographic information, including information on race and ethnicity, disability, and language preference for the purposes of reporting, measure stratification and other data collection efforts relating to quality. Recommendations for other types of readily available data elements for measuring disadvantage and discrimination for the purposes of reporting, measure stratification and other data collection efforts relating to quality, in addition, or in combination with race and ethnicity Recommendations for types of quality measures or measurement domains to prioritize for stratified reporting by dual eligibility, race and ethnicity, and disability. Examples of approaches, methods, research, andor considerations for use of data-driven technologies that do not facilitate exacerbation of health inequities, recognizing that biases may occur in methodology or be encoded in datasets. We received comments on these topics. Comments Many commenters expressed support for stratification by dual eligibility, race, and ethnicity. A few commenters expressed the belief that stratification of quality measures by social risk factors, such as dual eligibility and race and ethnicity, is essential to advancing health equity as such factors have been shown to have a likely impact on health outcomes. A few commenters expressed the belief that stratification will improve transparency, help identify existing disparities and inform efforts to reduce those disparities. A few commenters recommended that CMS take a stepwise approach to stratification. A few commenters stated that stratifying data is important to help identify health equity gaps, but recommended that CMS take action on its findings in order to address the health equity gap and reduce disparities in care. A few commenters recommended that CMS make stratified data publicly available to inform both CMS and stakeholders of the diverse needs of different patient populations, and identify needed policy changes to improve patient access to treatment. A few commenters expressed support for stratification but suggested setting a threshold at the 10th decile of low-income patient distribution to include facilities that serve a disproportionately high percentage of low-income patients. One commenter recommended that adjusting measures for social risk factors, including dual-eligibility or income, may reduce the likelihood of program penalties increasing existing disparities. One commenter supported the proposed stratification of facility-specific reports for ESRD QIP measure data by dual-eligibility status and race and ethnicity however, this commenter also recommended CMS monitor for unintended consequences believing that stratification risks disparities in patient treatment. Many commenters expressed support for stratification by dual eligibility. A few commenters supported stratification by dual eligible status, noting that it can be used as a proxy for socio-economic status and is an objective classification that may have less biased data. A few commenters expressed the belief that stratification could help facilities identify and reduce disparities, but noted that differences in Medicaid eligibility between states may impact comparability when stratifying measures by dual eligibility. One commenter expressed concern that dual eligibility may be too blunt a data point to identify the underlying cause of disparity, noting that disparities experienced by ESRD patients stem from a wide range of social risk factors. One commenter noted that understanding differences between dual-eligible and non-dual-eligible patients in baseline chronic kidney disease care could inform ways to allocate resources aimed at slowing the progression of CKD. One commenter noted the correlation between a facilitys dual-eligible patient population and a facilitys payment reduction based on its ESRD QIP scores, citing studies indicating that facilities serving a higher proportion of dual eligiblelow-income patients are more likely to have higher ESRD QIP payment reductions. Several commenters noted that, although stratification may help identify and address health equity gaps, many disparities begin decades prior to starting dialysis, and encouraged CMS to explore ways to address health disparities earlier in the progression of kidney disease. One commenter expressed concern that stratification may create unintended consequences such as disparities in patient treatment based on social determinants of health. One commenter recommended CMS consider options beyond stratification of ESRD QIP measures by dual eligible status or race and ethnicity to address health equity gaps. One commenter expressed its belief that the segmentation of populations using dual eligibility or race and ethnicity as the proxy for social risk, for example, is problematic and that the primary goal across all CMS programs should be to prioritize self-reported race, ethnicity, and other social determinants of health data as the sole source of stratifying populations to understand disparities. Many commenters expressed support for stratification of measures by race and ethnicity, noting that such factors have been identified as likely having an impact on health outcomes. A few commenters expressed support for the use of indirect estimation of race and ethnicity for purposes of calculating facility level performance measures as a preliminary step while more precise methods are developed. One commenter expressed support for the expansion of CMS Disparity Methods to the ESRD QIP and stratifying by race and ethnicity, both within and across facilities. One commenter recommended that disparities methods should be implemented in a way that is minimally burdensome and confidentially reported. A few commenters requested clarification regarding the application of disparity methods to the ESRD QIP, noting that disparity methods are currently applied to hospital readmissions measures which may be linked to factors outside the facilitys ability to influence. A few commenters expressed concern regarding the indirect estimation of race and ethnicity, believing that it was not worth the increased and unknown risk of bias that it could unintentionally create and recommended that indirect data be evaluated to ensure CMS is not introducing bias into the system or underestimating or overestimating the quality of care for a certain population. A few commenters expressed concern that the imputation method is imprecise, particularly for indigenous and multi-racial patients and recommended that self-reported data was more accurate. One commenterPage 61935questioned whether either of the two disparities methods would help close the health equity gap, and suggested that CMS consider whether an indirect estimation approach might divert resources away from developing better methods. One commenter recommended a step-wise approach to use the Within Facility Disparity Method before expanding to apply an Across-Facility Disparity Method to assess how a facility is addressing equity, as well as to better establish what resources may be required to effectively address equity. Several commenters expressed support for the stratification of the SRR, STrR, and SHR measures by dual-eligibility status and raceethnicity, noting that evidence has indicated disparities may factor into measure performance in other healthcare settings, and that such stratification may inform clinical practices and care. Several commenters suggested that the vascular access measures are appropriate for stratification by dual eligibility and raceethnicity. A few commenters also recommended that these measures be stratified by insurance status at the time of dialysis initiation in order to provide insight into patients abilities to access pre-dialysis care and vascular access placement. A few commenters stated that the PPPW measure is appropriate for potential stratification by dual eligibility status, raceethnicity, as well as geographic area. A few commenters recommended that stratification is adopted for measures where it has been shown, or is clearly suspected based on research from other care settings, that disparities are driving differences in the outcomes being reported. A few commenters expressed the belief that most ESRD QIP measures would benefit from stratification. One commenter recommended that CMS encourage all health care providers and organizations to collect and stratify both patient and caregiver data for all measures. A few commenters recommended that CMS develop best practices to ensure the security of data and its utilization, noting the sensitive nature of the data and the importance of gaining beneficiaries trust. A few commenters agreed that data elements should be subject to existing privacy and security requirements, and recommended that CMS establish an open and transparent process to work with NQF and other stakeholders to develop data options. One commenter expressed its belief in the unassailable importance of privacy safeguards for all uses of sensitive personal information such as race, ethnicity, and other social risk factors and recommended CMS consider using only self-reported data to alleviate risk of misidentification and to promote robust collection of patient-reported information. A few commenters expressed the belief that patient self-reporting is the most appropriate way to collect social determinants of health data such as race and ethnicity, agreeing with CMS assessment that self-reported patient data is the gold standard. A few commenters noted that one challenge may be that the concept of race is subjective and may be imprecise due to differences in cultural understanding. A few commenters recommended that CMS encourage facilities to collect self-reported race and ethnicity data, as well as establish a timeframe for meeting specific data collection goals including data completeness and accuracy requirements. One commenter noted that many health care organizations are already collecting self-reported demographic information and have been for years. One commenter expressed its belief that the primary goal across all CMS programs should be to prioritize self-reported race, ethnicity, and other social determinants of health data as the sole source of stratifying populations to understand disparities. One commenter recommended that, given the importance of self-reported data, CMS work on developing data collection language that is more person-centric in order to encourage trust among those patients whose data are being collected. Several commenters expressed support for collecting additional information that will likely impact patient outcomes, such as insurance status at dialysis initiation and geographic area of residence. Several commenters recommended the use of Z-codes or other data sources to collect data to report on factors such as housing insecurity, financial insecurity, caregiver support, mental illness, physical illness, age, education level, transportation insecurity, food insecurity, marital status, violence, safety concerns, and child care. One commenter recommended that CMS adopt a definition of health equity that takes into account the needs of various patient populations and structural issues associated with equity, such as race, ethnicity, sex, SOGI, language preference, tribal membership, and disability status. A few commenters recommended that CMS work with the kidney care community to develop risk adjusters for measures. A few commenters requested that methodologies use data elements that are available to providers and that calculations can be replicated to promote transparency. A few commenters recommended that CMS also consider eliminating bias in kidney function testing, noting for example that the eGFR test is biased based on racial assumptions and can impact transplant eligibility among Black patients. One commenter expressed concern that many approaches based on data-driven technologies are less accessible to vulnerable patient populations and would potentially exacerbate existing inequities. This commenter also noted that smartphone technologies may be more promising as an example of a data-driven technology that does not facilitate exacerbation of health inequities. Response We appreciate all of the comments and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of the CMS health equity quality measurement efforts. We will continue to take all concerns, comments, and suggestions into account for future development and expansion of our health equity quality measurement efforts.Improving Demographic Data Collection Experiences of users of certified health IT regarding local adoption of practices for collection of social, psychological, and behavioral data elements, the perceived value of using these data for improving decision-making and care delivery, and the potential challenges and benefits of collecting more granular, structured demographic information, such as the Race amp Ethnicity--CDC code system. The possible collection of a minimum set of social, psychological, and behavioral data elements by ESRD facilities at the time of admission using structured, interoperable electronic data standards, for the purposes of reporting, measure stratification and other data collection efforts relating to quality. We received comments on these topics. Comments Many commenters expressed support for CMS efforts to address inequities in health outcomes through improving data collection and patient outcome measurement. Several commenters supported the use of minimally burdensome data collection efforts. A few commenters noted that much of the information that CMS would like to collect is reported on Form 2728--ESRD Medical Evidence Report Medicare Entitlement AndOr Patient Registration OMB control number 0938-0046, and encouraged that CMS to be economical in its expansion of data collection on the Form 2728 so as to not create additional patient concerns. One commenter recommended that a system of dataPage 61936collection and reporting should not add to the confusion about what the terms race and ethnicity mean, and what labels appropriately fit either of these broad concepts. One commenter recommended that CMS collect data on demographic characteristics in a way that aligns with adoption of FHIR standards, noting that FHIR may be used to appropriately group demographic characteristics in a standardized way. One commenter noted the potential challenge of uploading data from facility EMR systems to CMS for measure calculation purposes. A few commenters expressed concerns with adjusting for social factors when there is a small numbers problem in ESRD QIP that can impact the accuracy of performance measurement and that will be aggravated with dividing categories into smaller subsets. One commenter expressed its belief that modifications to current data collection related to social, psychological, and behavioral data could be useful to CMS to address equity and quality of care. However, the commenter did not recommend the application of CDCs 900-variable system of identifying race and ethnicity, as provided in the CDCs Race and Ethnicity Code Set Version 1.0, in a highly granular way believing the volume of data that would need to be collected would make the process labor intensive for clinical staff. One commenter recommended that CMS work to improve and standardize the underlying data collection and metrics this commenter recommended a joint development process that includes the Center for Medicare amp Medicaid Innovation CMMI and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology ONC in collaboration with health systems, practices, and patientcommunity representation. Other commenters noted the importance of closing the health equity gap through measurement of demographic characteristics. One commenter suggested that agencies leverage the role of social workers in identifying sociodemographic factors and barriers to health equity. Another commenter supported this method, noting that although this may add another step to data collection processes, it would be valuable in addressing health equity gaps. To reduce possible workload burden on organizations that are new to this process, a commenter recommended a gradual approach to data collection. In addition, commenters suggested reducing burden by adopting standardized screening tools to collect this information, such as ICD-10-CM Z-codes, which in practice would allow patients to be referred to resources and initiatives when appropriate. Several commenters encouraged collection of comprehensive social determinants of health and demographic information in addition to race and ethnicity, such as disability, sexual orientation, and primary language. Several commenters provided feedback on the potential use of an indirect estimation algorithm when race and ethnicity are missing or incorrect, and emphasized the sensitivity of demographic information and recommended that CMS use caution when using estimates from the algorithm, including assessing for potential bias, reporting the results of indirect estimation alongside direct self-report at the organizational level for comparison, and establishing a timeline to transition to entirely directly collected data. Commenters also advised that CMS be transparent with beneficiaries and explain why data are being collected and the plans to use these data. A commenter noted that information technology infrastructure should be established in advance to ensure that this information is being used and exchanged appropriately. Response We appreciate all of the comments and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of the CMS health equity quality measurement efforts. We will continue to take all concerns, comments, and suggestions into account for future development and expansion of our health equity quality measurement efforts.Potential Creation of an ESRD Facility Equity Score To Synthesize Results Across Multiple Social Risk Factors The possible creation and confidential reporting of an ESRD Facility Equity Score to synthesize results across multiple social risk factors and disparity measures. Interventions ESRD facilities could institute to improve a low facility equity score and how improved demographic data could assist with these efforts. We received comments on these topics. Comments Several commenters expressed support for the concept of an ESRD Facility Equity Score, but requested that CMS provide further details. Several commenters recommended that CMS work with stakeholders in the kidney care community to develop an equity score in order to ensure transparency and to make sure providers are able to address identified inequities. One commenter recommended that CMS include education, training, and resources for implementation of an equity score. A few commenters noted the challenge of developing a scoring methodology that could address risk across different factors. A few commenters questioned whether the score would be meaningful for patients. A few commenters expressed concern for public reporting of a Facility Equity Score, noting that it might be misleading to patients and may not reflect quality of care because facilities are limited in their ability to influence disparities that impact health outcomes. One commenter expressed the belief that a Facility Equity Score is premature, and that CMS should focus on establishing the right set of patient characteristics and contrasting them with meaningful clinical and consumer measures in order to develop a meaningful scoring methodology to propose in future notice and comment rulemaking. One commenter expressed caution that the component measures should reflect actual differences in care provided by ESRD facilities and not factors outside of those facilities control, believing the inclusion of measures not much under the control of ESRD facilities will penalize those facilities serving a large number of vulnerable patients and not really speak to issues of equity in the care provided. This commenter recommended that measures are selected carefully to reflect activities and factors that are under facilities control and then apply all of the standard tools of quality improvement. One commenter expressed its belief that the use of an imputed raceethnicity methodology risks misattributing people to the wrong categories, and carrying that over into a facility equity score could lead to incorrect or misguided responses. This commenter recommended a careful, inclusive development process to avoid establishing processes and metrics that exacerbate harms and recommended a CMMI initiative to test and shape reporting. A few commenters expressed support for the production of reports to help facilities, patients and payers understand the disparities in their patient populations. A few commenters noted that many barriers such as anti-kickback rules and other regulations prevent facilities from providing additional services and supports that would help to address health disparities, and recommended that CMS work to find ways to remove these barriers. A few commenters recommended that CMS provide support to facilities in order to help them close gaps in health equity. OnePage 61937commenter recommended that additional resources be allocated to help assist and support facilities in their health equity goals, such as taking money from ESRD QIP penalties to reward facilities that attain the benchmarks and also allocate funds to help low performing facilities improve. One commenter noted that anything that requires additional staff time and effort without either additional payment or some tangible savings elsewhere, will not be sustainable. This commenter gave examples of care coordination, more time in patient education, more frequent patient home visits, and additional electronic home monitoring, as potential paths to equity improvement that require additional funding. We appreciate all of the comments and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of the CMS health equity quality measurement efforts. We will continue to take all concerns, comments, and suggestions into account for future development and expansion of our health equity quality measurement efforts. We also received comments on the general topic of health equity in the ESRD QIP. Comments Many commenters expressed overall support of CMS goals to advance health equity. There were a few comments regarding the need to further extend and specify the definition of equity provided in the proposed rule. Commenters also noted that equity initiatives should be based on existing disparities and population health goals, be mindful of the needs of the communities served, and work to bridge dialysis facilities with community-based providers. Several commenters recommended that CMS further investigate ways to provide outreach and education aimed at slowing down the progress of chronic kidney disease and address health disparities before dialysis is necessary. Several commenters encouraged CMS to be mindful about whether collection of additional quality measures and standardized patient assessment elements might increase provider burden. We appreciate all of the comments and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of the CMS health equity quality measurement efforts. We will continue to take all concerns, comments, and suggestions into account for future development.2. COVID-19 Vaccination Measures Request for Informationa.

FDA Approves First COVID-19 Vaccine, Available at As part of its national strategy to address COVID-19, the Biden Administration stated that it would work with states and the private sector to execute an aggressive vaccination strategy and outlined a goal of administering 200 million shots in 100 days.220 After achieving this goal,221 the Biden Administration announced a new goal to administer at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot to 70 percent of the U.S adult population by July 4, 2021.222 Although the goal of the U.S government is to ensure that every American who wants to receive a COVID-19 vaccine can receive one, Federal agencies recommended that early vaccination efforts focus on those critical to the PHE response, including HCP providing direct care to patients with COVID-19, and individuals at highest risk for developing severe illness from COVID-19.223 For example, the CDCs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP recommended that HCP should be among those individuals prioritized to receive the initial, limited supply of the COVID-19 vaccination, given the potential for transmission in health care settings and the need to preserve health care system capacity.224 Research suggests most states followed this recommendation,225 and HCP began receiving the vaccine in mid-December of 2020.226 Although the vaccination strategy for individuals at highest risk for developing severe illness from COVID-19, including ESRD patients, has varied from State to State,227 ACIP recommendations indicated that ESRD patients would be offered the COVID-19 vaccine based on their high-risk status as part of phase 1c.228--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 220 The White House.

This action will create a consistent standard across the country, while giving patients assurance of the vaccination status of those delivering care.---------------------------------------------------------------------------b. COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage Among Healthcare Personnel HCP Measure In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36369, we stated our belief that it is important to incentivize and track HCP vaccination in dialysis facilities through quality measurement in order to protect health care workers, patients, and caregivers, and to help sustain the ability of these facilities toPage 61939continue serving their communities throughout the PHE and beyond. We recognize the importance of COVID-19 vaccination, and have finalized proposals to include a COVID-19 HCP vaccination measure in various pay for reporting programs, such as the Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting Program 86 FR 42633 through 42640, the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program 86 FR 45374 through 45382, the PPS-Exempt Cancer Hospital Quality Reporting PCHQR Program 86 FR 45428 through 45434, the Long-Term Care Hospital Quality Reporting Program LTCH QRP 86 FR 45438 through 45446, the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Quality Reporting Program IRF QRP 86 FR 42385 through 42396, and the Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program 86 FR 42480 through 42489. In the proposed rule, we noted that there is not a pay for reporting program under the ESRD PPS, however, we stated our belief that the public reporting of vaccination data on Dialysis Facility Compare is important and would help to inform patients of a facilitys COVID-19 vaccination rates of HCP. Currently, there is a measure for HCP 234 and another for patient COVID-19 vaccination 235 rates and such measures are currently reported to CDCs National Healthcare Safety Network via ESRD Networks. The two measures track the proportions of a facilitys HCP and patient population, respectively, that have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Facilities were able to begin weekly COVID-19 vaccination reporting for HCP in December 2020,236 and were able to begin weekly COVID-19 vaccination reporting for patients in March 2021.237 When the proposed rule was published, we noted that 89 percent of ESRD facilities were reporting HCP vaccination rates and almost 95 percent of ESRD facilities were reporting patient vaccination rates on these measures. In the proposed rule 86 FR 36369, we stated that we were evaluating options for publicly reporting the data on official CMS datasets that compare the quality of care provided in Medicare-certified dialysis facilities nationwide. We further stated that we were also exploring the potential future inclusion of a COVID-19 vaccination measure to the ESRD QIP. Therefore, we sought public comment on adding a new measure, COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage Among HCP, to the ESRD QIP measure set in the next rulemaking cycle. The measure would assess the proportion of a facilitys health care workforce that has been vaccinated against COVID-19.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 234 235 236 237 HCP are at risk of carrying COVID-19 infection to patients, experiencing illness or death as a result of COVID-19 themselves, and transmitting it to their families, friends, and the general public. In the proposed rule 86 FR 36369, we stated our belief that facilities should track the level of vaccination among their HCP as part of their efforts to assess and reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 within their facilities. HCP vaccination can potentially reduce illness that leads to work absence and limit disruptions to care.238 Data from influenza vaccination demonstrates that provider uptake of the vaccine is associated with that provider recommending vaccination to patients,239 and we stated our belief that HCP COVID-19 vaccination in dialysis facilities could similarly increase uptake among that patient population. We also stated our belief that publishing the HCP vaccination rates would be helpful to many patients, including those who are at high-risk for developing serious complications from COVID-19, as they choose facilities from which to seek treatment. Under CMS Meaningful Measures Framework, the COVID-19 measure would address the quality priority of Promoting Effective Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Disease through the Meaningful Measures Area of Preventive Care.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 238 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

COVID-19 can cause outbreaks in ESRD facilities, and may disproportionately affect ESRD patients due to the nature of the treatment and sharing of common spaces.240 Many patients treated in ESRD facilities have other underlying chronic conditions, and therefore are highly susceptible to illness and disease.241 Sufficient vaccination coverage among patients in ESRD facilities may reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, thereby protecting them from COVID-19 mortality. Therefore, we sought public comment on adding new measure, COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage Among Patients, to the ESRD QIP measure set in future rulemaking. The measure would assess the proportion of a facilitys patient population that has been vaccinated against COVID-19.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 240 Verma, A., Patel, A., Tio, M., Waikar, S., Caring for Dialysis Patients in a Time of COVID-19.

We also expressed our belief that publishing the vaccination rates would be helpful to many ESRD patients, including those who are at high-risk for developing serious complications from COVID-19, as they choose facilities from which to seek treatment. Under CMS Meaningful Measures Framework, the COVID-19 measure addresses the quality priority of Promoting Effective Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Disease through the Meaningful Measures Area of Preventive Care.d. Review by the Measures Application Partnership and NQF The COVID-19 HCP vaccination measure and the COVID-19 patient vaccination measure were included on the publicly available List of Measures under Consideration for December 21, 2020 MUC List, a list of measures under consideration for use in various Medicare programs.242 When the Measure Applications Partnership Hospital Workgroup convened on January 11, 2021, it reviewed measures on the MUC List including the two COVID-19 vaccination measures. The Measure Applications Partnership Hospital Workgroup recognized that the proposed measures represent a promising effort to advance measurement for an evolving national pandemic and that it would bring value to the ESRD QIP measure set byPage 61940providing transparency about an important COVID-19 intervention to help prevent infections in HCP and patients.243 The Measure Applications Partnership Hospital Workgroup also stated that collecting information on COVID-19 vaccination coverage among HCP and ESRD patients, and providing feedback to facilities, will allow facilities to benchmark coverage rates and improve coverage in their facility. The Measure Applications Partnership Hospital Workgroup further noted that reducing rates of COVID-19 in HCP and ESRD patients may reduce transmission among a patient population that is highly susceptible to illness and disease, and also reduce instances of staff shortages due to illness.244--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 242 National Quality Forum.

In the 2020-2021 Measure Applications Partnership Final Recommendations, Measure Applications Partnership offered conditional support for rulemaking contingent on CMS bringing the measures back to Measure Applications Partnership once the specifications are further refined.247 The Measure Applications Partnership specifically stated, the incomplete specifications require immediate mitigation and further development should continue. 248 The Measure Applications Partnership further noted that the measures would add value to the ESRD QIP measure set by providing visibility into an important intervention to limit COVID-19 infections in HCP and the ESRD patients for whom they provide care.249 CMS brought both measures back to the Measure Applications Partnership on March 15, 2021 to provide additional information and continue discussing mitigation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 245 Ibid. 246 Ibid. 247 Measure Applications Partnership. 2020-2021 MAP Final Recommendations.

Accessed on February 23, 2021 at Request for Public Comment In the proposed rule, we sought public comment on potentially adding the two new COVID-19 vaccination measures discussed above, the COVID-19 vaccination measure for HCP and the COVID-19 vaccination measure for patients, to the ESRD QIP measure set.250--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 250 Specifications for both measures available at We were also interested in public comment on data collection, submission, and reporting for the COVID-19 vaccination measure for HCP and the COVID-19 vaccination measure for patients. For example, we stated that we were considering requiring reporting for these measures on an annual basis for the performance period for each calendar year corresponding to the associated payment year, and the reporting period would be January 1 through December 31 annually. Based on the measures currently being developed by the CDC that were submitted to the Measure Applications Partnership, facilities would report the measures through the National Healthcare Safety Network NHSN web-based surveillance system. We also sought public comment from stakeholders on other ways to collect data on COVID-19 vaccination rates at dialysis facilities for ESRD QIP purposes and their associated costs and burdens. Given the immediacy of the PHE for COVID-19, as well as the importance of continuing to monitor and make publicly available COVID-19 vaccination rates as the PHE ends, we stated that we anticipate rulemaking on this requirement in the CY 2023 rulemaking cycle. The comments we received and our responses are set forth below. Comment Several commenters expressed support for future adoption of both COVID-19 vaccination measures. Several commenters expressed the belief that COVID-19 vaccination measures are important because they would help to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in a facility and would also help to prevent mortality due to the impact of COVID-19 on an immunocompromised patient population. A few commenters stated that such measures would help encourage COVID-19 vaccination for both staff and patients at ESRD facilities. One commenter noted that the nature of treatment sessions in the dialysis care setting may make other COVID-19 mitigation strategies less effective. A few commenters expressed support for the possible adoption of both COVID-19 vaccination measures, noting that making such data publicly available would help patients make informed choices. A few commenters expressed support for reporting possible COVID-19 vaccination measures through NHSN as it already does so and therefore would be less burdensome. Several commenters expressed support for tracking and reporting COVID-19 vaccination rates among HCPs and ESRD patients on Care Compare or Dialysis Facility Compare in order to help patients make informed decisions when choosing a dialysis facility. One commenter expressed support the application of a uniform reporting metric for COVID-19 vaccination among HCPs and patients across all Medicare-covered health settings. A few commenters expressed support for all efforts to increase vaccination coverage among HCPs for their own safety and for patient safety as well. One commenter expressed its belief that all medically-eligible HCPs should be vaccinated against COVID-19. A few commenters expressed support for the COVID-19 Vaccination among ESRD patients measure. One commenter expressed the belief that it may be useful for the public to know the percent of patients vaccinated at a facility. Response We thank the commenters for their support, and will take commenters feedback into consideration for future rulemaking. Comment Although several commenters expressed support for vaccination efforts and the belief that patients and HCPs should follow CDC vaccination guidelines, these commenters did not support the inclusion of COVID-19 vaccination measures in the ESRD QIP. A few commenters recommended that COVID-19 vaccination measures should not be added to the ESRD QIP, noting the MAPs initial hesitancy to recommend the measures. A few commenters expressed the belief that such measures would not help to address vaccine hesitancy among patients and HCPs, and suggested that Federal agenciesPage 61941coordinate vaccination education and outreach efforts instead. A few commenters expressed concern that including COVID-19 vaccination measures in the ESRD QIP would hold facilities accountable for vaccination rates of patients and HCPs, noting that the individual decision to get vaccinated is beyond the facilitys control. One commenter recommended that such measures incorporate factors that take into account facility vaccination efforts, rather than a numeric threshold. One commenter expressed support for including the COVID-19 vaccination measures as performance measures in the ESRD QIP. One commenter recommended that such measures be included in the ESRD QIP as reporting measures. Response We thank the commenters for their feedback, and will take this input into consideration for future rulemaking. We note that the MAP now recommends both COVID-19 vaccination measures for inclusion in the ESRD QIP.251 We also note that the COVID-19 vaccination measures that we describe in this final rule and are considering for adoption in future rulemaking would be reporting measures. Under these measures, facilities would only be required to report vaccination rates and would not be penalized based on the vaccination rates themselves.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 251 Measure Applications Partnership. 2020-2021 MAP Final Recommendations. Accessed on September 29, 2021 at Comment Several commenters expressed concern that establishing the specifications for such measures would be challenging due to changing COVID-19 vaccination guidelines and differences in regional policies, which may undermine the validity or reliability of a COVID-19 vaccination measure. A few commenters requested that CMS provide more specific details regarding proposed vaccination measure specifications, including defined numerators and denominators, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria. A few commenters expressed concern that defining the denominator for the COVID-19 HCP Vaccination measure will be challenging because many ESRD facilities are parts of larger organizations and may share staff who spend some time working in the ESRD unit or facility and time working elsewhere. One commenter requested that the possible COVID-19 Vaccination among HCP measure limit data collection to HCPs employed by the dialysis organizations and only require the reporting of information within the facilities purview, noting that the CDC is able to obtain non-clinic staff information directly from providers. Response We thank the commenters for their feedback, and will take this input into consideration for future rulemaking. We acknowledge that measure specifications may evolve based on changes to COVID-19 vaccination guidelines, and would provide more specific details regarding measure specifications in future rulemaking as part of our proposals to adopt the COVID-19 vaccination measures. Comment A few commenters expressed concern that implementing such measures would result in staff quitting in order to avoid vaccination, which would in turn negatively impact patient care. Response We acknowledge that staffing shortages are a national issue, especially for the healthcare system. However, we disagree that staffing shortages would impact patient safety more than unvaccinated HCPs. We believe that vaccination is one of the most effective tools right now for protecting an immunocompromised patient population that has particularly high mortality rates due to COVID-19 infection. We also note that the COVID-19 Vaccination among HCP measure that we are considering for future adoption would not require vaccination, but would rather require facilities to report vaccination rates. Comment One commenter recommended that patients such as children 11 and under who are not yet eligible for vaccination under an EUA or approval should be excluded from any vaccination measure. Response The current COVID-19 Vaccination among Patients measure being considered for possible adoption in future rulemaking excludes patients who are ineligible for vaccination. Comment A few commenters did not support the future inclusion of a COVID-19 Vaccination among Patients measure. One commenter acknowledged that a COVID-19 patient vaccination measure likely would marginally increase and sustain vaccination rates, but expressed concern that tying a COVID-19 patient vaccination measure to payment may have unintended consequences such as undermining patient autonomy and creating barriers to facility access for unvaccinated patients. One commenter did not support the COVID-19 vaccination measure for patients believing there is no point to collecting data that mostly reflects patient demographics based on vaccination status, not clinical quality. This commenter stated its belief that providers are already motivated to ensure their patients are vaccinated given the high COVID-19 mortality rate among ESRD patients. Response The COVID-19 patient vaccination measure that we are considering for adoption in future rulemaking is a reporting measure facilities would only be required to report vaccination rates and would not be penalized based on actual vaccination rates. We agree that the COVID-19 vaccination measure for patients would collect data that indicates patient vaccination rates at an individual facility. However, we also believe that this measure would motivate providers to ensure their patients are vaccinated against COVID-19 and that this information is also relevant to patient safety since a facilitys vaccination rates would be important for patients to know when choosing an individual facility for treatment.3. Advancing to Digital Quality Measurement and the Use of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources FHIR We aim to move fully to digital quality measurement in CMS quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by 2025. As part of this modernization of our quality measurement enterprise, we issued a request for information RFI. The purpose of this RFI was to gather broad public input solely for planning purposes for our transition to digital quality measurement. Any updates to specific program requirements related to providing data for quality measurement and reporting provisions would be addressed through future rulemaking, as necessary. This RFI contained four parts Background. This part provided information on our quality measurement programs and our goal to move fully to digital quality measurement by 2025. This part also provided a summary of other recent HHS policy developments that are advancing interoperability and could support our move towards full digital quality measurement. Definition of Digital Quality Measures dQMs. This part provided a potential definition for dQMs. Specific requests for input are included in the section. Changes Under Consideration to Advance Digital Quality Measurement Actions in Four Areas to Transition to Digital Quality Measures by 2025. This part introduced four possible steps that would enable transformation of CMS quality measurement enterprise to bePage 61942fully digital by 2025. Specific requests for input are included in the section. Solicitation of Comments. This part listed all requests for input included in the above sections of this RFI.a. Background As required by law, we implemented quality measurement programs and value-based purchasing programs across a broad range of inpatient, outpatient, and post-acute care PAC settings, consistent with our mission to improve the quality of health care for Americans through measurement, transparency, and increasingly, value-based purchasing. These quality programs are foundational for incentivizing value-based care, contributing to improvements in health care, enhancing patient outcomes, and informing consumer choice. We aim to move fully to digital quality measurement by 2025. We acknowledge providers within the various care and practice settings covered by our quality programs may be at different stages of readiness, and therefore, the timeline for achieving full digital quality measurement across our quality reporting programs may vary. We also continue to evolve the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program that advances the use of certified electronic health record EHR technology, from an initial focus on electronic data capture to enhancing information exchange and expanding quality measurement 83 FR 41634. However, reporting quality data via EHRs remains burdensome, and our current approach to quality measurement does not readily incorporate emerging data sources such as patient-reported outcomes PRO and patient-generated health data PGHD.252 There is a need to streamline our approach to data collection, calculation, and reporting to fully leverage clinical and patient-centered information for measurement, improvement, and learning.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 252 What are patient generated health data Additionally, advancements in technical standards and regulatory initiatives to improve interoperability of healthcare data are creating an opportunity to significantly improve our quality measurement systems. In May 2020, we finalized interoperability requirements in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule 85 FR 25510 to support beneficiary access to data held by certain payers. At the same time, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology ONC finalized policies in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule 85 FR 25642 to advance the interoperability of health IT as defined in section 4003 of the Cures Act, including the complete access, exchange, and use of all electronically accessible health information. Closely working with ONC, we collaboratively identified HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources FHIRsupreg Release 4.0.1 as the standard to support Application Programming Interface API policies in both rules. ONC, on behalf of HHS, adopted the HL7 FHIR Release 4.0.1 for APIs and related implementation specifications at 45 CFR 170.215 We believe the FHIR standard has the potential to be a more efficient and modular standard to enable APIs. We also believe this standard enables collaboration and information sharing, which is essential for delivering high-quality care and better outcomes at a lower cost. By aligning technology requirements for payers, health care providers, and health IT developers, HHS can advance-an interoperable health IT infrastructure that ensures providers and patients have access to health data when and where it is needed. In the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule ONC adopted a Standardized API for Patient and Population Services certification criterion for health IT that requires the use of the FHIR Release 4 and several implementation specifications. Health IT certified to this criterion will offer single patient and multiple patient services that can be accessed by third party applications 85 FR 25742.253 The ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule also requires health IT developers update their certified health IT to support the U.S Core Data for Interoperability USCDI standard.254 The scope of patient data identified in the USCDI and the data standards that support this data set are expected to evolve over time, starting with data specified in Version 1 of the USCDI. In November 2020, ONC issued an interim final rule with comment period extending the date when health IT developers must make technology meeting updated certification criteria available under the ONC Health IT Certification Program until December 31, 2022 85 FR 70064.255--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 253 Application Programming Interfaces API Resource Guide, Version 1.0 Available at 254 255 Information Blocking and the ONC Health IT Certification Program Extension of Compliance Dates and Timeframes in Response to the Covid-19 Public Health Emergency. The CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule 85 FR 25510 and program policies build on the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule 85 FR 25642. The CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule and policies require certain payers for example, Medicare Advantage organizations, Medicaid, and CHIP fee for service programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and Qualified Health Plan QHP issuers on the Federally-facilitated Exchanges FFEs to implement and maintain a standards-based Patient Access API using HL7 FHIR Release 4.0.1 to make available certain data to their enrollees and beneficiaries called patients in the CMS interoperability rule. These certain data include data concerning claims and encounters, with the intent to ensure access to their own health care information through third-party software applications. The rule also established new Conditions of Participation for Medicare and Medicaid participating hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and critical access hospitals CAHs, requiring them to send electronic notifications to another healthcare facility or community provider or practitioner when a patient is admitted, discharged, or transferred 85 FR 25603. In the CY 2021 Physician Fee Schedule PFS final rule 85 FR 84472, we finalized a policy to align the certified EHR technology required for use in the Promoting Interoperability programs and the MIPS Promoting Interoperability performance category with the updates to health IT certification criteria finalized in the ONC 21st Century Cures Act. Under this policy, eligible clinicians, MIPS eligible clinicians, and eligible hospitals and CAHs participating in the Promoting Interoperability Programs, must use technology meeting the updated certification criteria for performance and reporting periods beginning in 2023 85 FR 84825. The use of APIs can also reduce long-standing barriers to quality measurement. Currently, health IT developers are required to implement individual measure specifications within their health IT product. The health IT developer must also accommodate how that product connects with the unique variety of systems within a specific care setting.256Page 61943This may be further complicated by systems which integrate a wide range of data schemas. This process is burdensome and costly, and it is difficult to reliably obtain high quality data across systems. As health IT developers map their health IT data to the FHIR standard and related implementation specifications, APIs can enable these data to be easily accessible for measurement or other use cases, such as care coordination, clinical decision support, and supporting patient access.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 256 The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Strategy on Reducing Regulatory and Administrative Burden Relating to the Use of Health IT and EHRs, Final Report Feb. 2020. Available at We believe the emerging data standardization and interoperability enabled by APIs will support the transition to full digital quality measurement by 2025, and are committed to exploring and seeking input on potential solutions for the transition to digital quality measurement as described in this RFI.b. Definition of Digital Quality Measures In the proposed rule, we sought to refine the definition of digital quality measures dQMs to further operationalize our objective of fully transitioning to dQMs by 2025. We previously noted dQMs use sources of health information that are captured and can be transmitted electronically and via interoperable systems 85 FR 84845. In this RFI, we sought input on future elaboration that would define a dQM as a software that processes digital data to produce a measure score or measure scores. Data sources for dQMs may include administrative systems, electronically submitted clinical assessment data, case management systems, EHRs, instruments for example, medical devices and wearable devices, patient portals or applications for example, for collection of patient-generated health data, health information exchanges HIEs or registries, and other sources. We also noted that dQMs are intended to improve the patient experience including quality of care, improve the health of populations, andor reduce costs. We discuss one potential approach to developing dQM software in section IV.G.3.c of this final rule. In this section, we sought comment on the potential definition of dQMs in this RFI. We also sought feedback on how leveraging advances in technology for example, FHIR APIs to access and electronically transmit interoperable data for dQMs could reinforce other activities to support quality measurement and improvement for example, the aggregation of data across multiple data sources, rapid-cycle feedback, and alignment of programmatic requirements. The transition to dQMs relies on advances in data standardization and interoperability. As providers and payers work to implement the required advances in interoperability over the next several years, we will continue to support reporting of eCQMs through CMS quality reporting programs and through the Promoting Interoperability programs.257 These fully digital measures continue to be important drivers of interoperability advancement and learning. We are currently re-specifying and testing these measures to use FHIR rather than the currently adopted Quality Data Model QDM in anticipation of the wider use of FHIR standards. We intend to apply significant components of the output of this work, such as the re-specified measure logic and the learning done through measure testing with FHIR APIs, to define and build future dQMs that take advantage of the expansion of standardized, interoperable data.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 257 eCQI Resource Center, Changes Under Consideration To Advance Digital Quality Measurement Potential Actions in Four Areas To Transition to Digital Quality Measures by 2025 Building on the advances in interoperability and learning from testing of FHIR-converted eCQMs, we aim to move fully to dQMs, originating from sources of health information that are captured and can be transmitted electronically via interoperable systems, by 2025. To enable this transformation, we are considering further modernizing the quality measurement enterprise in four major ways 1 Leverage and advance standards for digital data and obtain all EHR data required for quality measures via provider FHIR-based APIs 2 redesign our quality measures to be self-contained tools 3 better support data aggregation and 4 work to align measure requirements across our reporting programs, other Federal programs and agencies, and the private sector where appropriate. These changes would enable us to collect and utilize more timely, actionable, and standardized data from diverse sources and care settings to improve the scope and quality of data used in quality reporting and payment programs, reduce quality reporting burden, and make results available to stakeholders in a rapid-cycle fashion. Data collection and reporting efforts would become more efficient, supported by advances in interoperability and data standardization. Aggregation of data from multiple sources would allow assessments of costs and outcomes to be measured across multiple care settings for an individual patient or clinical conditions. We believe that aggregating data for measurement can incorporate a more holistic assessment of an individuals health and healthcare and produce the rich set of data needed to enable patients and caregivers to make informed decisions by combining data from multiple sources for example, patient reported data, EHR data, and claims data for measurement. Perhaps most importantly, these steps would help us deliver on the full promise of quality measurement and drive us toward a learning health system that transforms healthcare quality, safety, and coordination and effectively measures and achieves value-based care. The shift from a static to a learning health system hinges on the interoperability of healthcare data, and the use of standardized data. dQMs would leverage this interoperability to deliver on the promise of a learning health system wherein standards-based data sharing and analysis, rapid-cycle feedback, and quality measurement and incentives are aligned for continuous improvement in patient-centered care. Similarly, standardized, interoperable data used for measurement can also be used for other use cases, such as clinical decision support and care coordination and care decision support, which impacts health care and care quality. We requested comments on four potential future actions that would enable transformation to a fully digital quality measurement enterprise by 2025.1 Leveraging and Advancing Standards for Digital Data and Obtaining All EHR Data Required for Quality Measures via Provider FHIR-Based APIs We are considering targeting the data required for our quality measures that utilize EHR data to be data retrieved via FHIR-based APIs based on standardized, interoperable data. Utilizing standardized data for EHR-based measurement based on FHIR and associated implementation guides and aligning where possible with interoperability requirements can eliminate the data collection burden providers currently experience with required chart-abstracted quality measures and reduce the burden of reporting digital quality measure results. We can fully leverage this advance to adapt eCQMs and expand to otherPage 61944dQMs through the adoption of interoperable standards across other digital data sources. We are considering methods and approaches to leverage the interoperability data requirements for APIs set by the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule for certified health technology to support modernization of CMS quality measure reporting. As discussed previously, these requirements will be included in certified technology in future years 85 FR 84825, including availability of data included in the USCDI via standards-based APIs, and CMS will require clinicians and hospitals participating in MIPS and the Promoting Interoperability Programs, respectively, to transition to use of certified technology updated consistent with the 2015 Cures Edition Update 85 FR 84825. Digital data used for measurement could expand beyond data captured in traditional clinical settings, administrative claims data, and EHRs. Many important data sources are not currently captured digitally, such as survey and PGHD. We intend to work to innovate and broaden the digital data used across the quality measurement enterprise beyond the clinical EHR and administrative claims. Agreed upon standards for these data, and associated implementation guides will be important for interoperability and quality measurement. We will consider developing clear guidelines and requirements for these digital data that align with interoperability requirements, for example, expressing in standards, exposing via APIs, and incentivizing technologies that innovate data capture and interoperability. High quality data are also essential for reliable and valid measurement. Hence, in implementing the shift to capture all clinical EHR data via FHIR-based APIs, we would support efforts to strengthen and test the quality of the data obtained through FHIR-based APIs for quality measurement. We currently conduct audits of electronic data with functions including checks for data completeness and data accuracy, confirmation of proper data formatting, alignment with standards, and appropriate data cleaning. These functions would continue and be applied to dQMs and further expanded to automate the manual validation of the data compared to the original data source for example, the medical record where possible. Analytic advancements such as natural language processing, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence, can support this evolution. These techniques can be applied to validating observed patterns in data and inferences or conclusions drawn from associations, as data are received, to ensure high quality data are used for measurement. We sought feedback on the goal of aligning data needed for quality measurement with interoperability requirements and the strengths and limitations of this approach. We also sought feedback on the importance of and approaches to supporting inclusion of PGHD and other currently non-standardized data. We also welcomed comment on approaches for testing data quality and validity.2 Redesigning Quality Measures To Be Self-Contained Tools We are considering approaches for deploying quality measures to take advantage of standardized data and interoperability requirements that have expanded flexibility and functionality compared to CMS current eCQMs. We are considering defining and developing dQM software as end-to-end measure calculation solutions that retrieve data from primarily FHIR resources maintained by providers, payers, CMS, and others calculate measure scores and produce reports. In general, we believe to optimize the use of standardized and interoperable data, the software solution for dQMs should do the following Have the flexibility to support calculation of single or multiple quality measures. Perform three functions i Obtain data via automated queries from a broad set of digital data sources initially from EHRs, and in the future from claims, PRO, and PGHD ii calculate the measure score according to measure logic and iii generate measure score reports. Be compatible with any data source systems that implement standard interoperability requirements. Exist separately from digital data sources and respect the limitations of the functionality of those data sources. Be tested and updated independently of the data source systems. Operate in accordance with health information protection requirements under applicable laws and comply with governance functions for health information exchange. Have the flexibility to be deployed by individual health systems, health IT vendors, data aggregators, and health plans andor run by CMS depending on the program and measure needs and specifications. Be designed to enable easy installation for supplemental uses by medical professionals and other non-technical end-users, such as local calculation of quality measure scores or quality improvement. Have the flexibility to employ current and evolving advanced analytic approaches such as natural language processing. Be designed to support pro-competitive practices for development, maintenance, and implementation and diffusion of quality measurement and related quality improvement and clinical tools through for example the use of open-source core architecture. We sought comment on these suggested functionalities and other additional functionalities that quality measure tools should ideally have particularly in the context of the pending availability of standardized and interoperable data for example, standardized EHR data available via FHIR-based APIs. We were also interested whether and how this more open, agile strategy may facilitate broader engagement in quality measure development, the use of tools developed for measurement for local quality improvement, andor the application of quality tools for related purposes such as public health or research.3 Building a Pathway to Data Aggregation in Support of Quality Measurement Using multiple sources of collected data to inform measurement would reduce data fragmentation or, different pieces of data regarding a single patient stored in many different places. Additionally, we are also considering expanding and establishing policies and processes for data aggregation and measure calculation by third-party aggregators that include, but are not limited to, HIEs and clinical registries. Qualified Clinical Data Registries and Qualified Registries that report quality measures for eligible clinicians in the Merit-based Incentive Payment System MIPS program are potential examples 258 at 42 CFR 414.1440b2iv and v and Sec. 414.1440c2iii and iv and can also support measure reporting. We are considering establishing similar policies for third-party aggregators to maintain the integrity of our measure reporting process and to encourage market innovation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 258 Calendar Year CY 2021 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule Finalized New and Updated Qualified Clinical Data Registry QCDR and Qualified Registry Policies, We sought feedback on aggregation of data from multiple sources being usedPage 61945to inform measurement. We also sought feedback on the role data aggregators can and should play in CMS quality measure reporting in collaboration with providers, and how we can best facilitate and enable aggregation.4 Potential Future Alignment of Measures Across Reporting Programs, Federal and State Agencies, and the Private Sector We are committed to using policy levers and working with stakeholders to solve the issue of interoperable data exchange and to transition to full digital quality measurement. We are considering the future potential development and multi-staged implementation of a common portfolio of dQMs across our regulated programs, agencies, and private payers. This common portfolio would require alignment of 1 Measure concepts and specifications including narrative statements, measure logic, and value sets, and 2 the individual data elements used to build these measure specifications and calculate the measure logic. Further, the required data elements would be limited to standardized, interoperable data elements to the fullest extent possible hence, part of the alignment strategy will be the consideration and advancement of data standards and implementation guides for key data elements. We would coordinate closely with quality measure developers, Federal and State agencies, and private payers to develop and to maintain a cohesive dQM portfolio that meets our programmatic requirements and that fully aligns across Federal and State agencies and payers to the extent possible. We intend for this coordination to be ongoing and allow for continuous refinement to ensure quality measures remain aligned with evolving healthcare practices and priorities for example, PROs, disparities, care coordination, and track with the transformation of data collection, alignment with health IT module updates including capabilities and standards adopted by ONC for example, standards to enable APIs. This coordination would build on the principles outlined in HHS National Health Quality Roadmap.259 It would focus on the quality domains of safety, timeliness, efficiency, effectiveness, equitability, and patient-centeredness. It would leverage several existing Federal and public-private efforts including our Meaningful Measures 2.0 Framework the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization DoDVA the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qualitys Clinical Decision Support Initiative the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Adapting Clinical Guidelines for the Digital Age initiative the Core Quality Measure Collaborative, which convenes stakeholders from Americas Health Insurance Plans AHIP, CMS, NQF, provider organizations, private payers, and consumers and develops consensus on quality measures for provider specialties and the NQF-convened Measure Applications Partnership, which recommends measures for use in public payment and reporting programs. We would coordinate with HL7s ongoing work to advance FHIR resources in critical areas to support patient care and measurement such as social determinants of health. Through this coordination, we would identify which existing measures could be used or evolved to be used as dQMs, in recognition of current healthcare practice and priorities.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 259 Department of Health and Human Services, National Health Quality Roadmap May 2020. Available at This multi-stakeholder, joint Federal and industry, made possible and enabled by the pending advances towards true interoperability, would yield a significantly improved quality measurement enterprise. The success of the dQM portfolio would be enhanced by the degree to which the measures achieve our programmatic requirements for measures as well as the requirements of other agencies and payers. We sought feedback on initial priority areas for the dQM portfolio given evolving interoperability requirements for example, measurement areas, measure requirements, tools, and data standards. We also sought to identify opportunities to collaborate with other Federal agencies, states, and the private sector to adopt standards and technology-driven solutions to address our quality measurement priorities across sectors.d. Solicitation of Comments We plan to continue working with other agencies and stakeholders to coordinate and to inform any potential transition to dQMs by 2025. We have summarized the comments to this RFI below but note that we will not be responding to them in this final rule. We will actively consider all input as we develop future regulatory proposals or future subregulatory policy guidance. Any updates to specific program requirements related to quality measurement and reporting provisions would be addressed through separate and future notice-and-comment rulemaking, as necessary. As noted previously, we sought input on the future development of the following Definition of Digital Quality Measures We sought feedback on the following as described in section IV.G.3.c 2.  Do you have feedback on the dQM definition?  Does this approach to defining and deploying dQMs to interface with FHIR-based APIs seem promising? We also welcomed more specific comments on the attributes or functions to support such an approach of deploying dQMs. We received comments on these topics. Comment Several commenters expressed support for the proposed definition of dQM. Several commenters recommended additional clarity on the proposed definition of dQM, including more detail on what the measures would be, how they differ from current ESRD QIP measures, and the sources of data for those measures. One commenter recommended that CMS refine its definition of dQMs, focus on currently available valid and reliable digital data sources, and set clear and specific parameters for what they expect of dialysis providers during this transition. Several commenters expressed support for transitioning toward interoperability through dQMS to interface with FHIR-based resources. One commenter noted that FHIR cannot solve or improve data quality alone without extensive development of FHIR extensions and profiles noting that many ESRD-specific data elements are not part of hospital EHR systems because they are not part of meaningful use requirements this commenter made recommendations for data elements to be included in future versions of United States Core Data for Interoperability USCDI. One commenter recommended that CMS evaluate the progress of developers and providers in adopting FHIR standards to ensure that the adoption of FHIR standards is not cost-prohibitive or overly burdensome and that CMS establish a clear timeframe for adoption of FHIR standards, including a trial or voluntary participation period prior to formal adoption. One commenter recommended that CMS ensure that dQMs can be linked with patient-level data such as patient experience of care and patient-reported outcomes. One commenter expressed support for CMS approach to defining and deploying dQMs on FHIR believing it has the potential to further enhance value-based care that puts patient interests as the focal point. ThisPage 61946commenter recommended that implementation of dQMs be gradual, transparent, and based on robust technology. The commenter also noted its belief that the market of software developers would very quickly be able to respond to the CMS request for dQMs. One commenter expressed agreement that data sources should include administrative systems, electronically submitted clinical assessment data, case management systems, electronic health records, instruments such as medical devices or wearable devices, patient portals or applications, health information exchanges or registries, and other sources. One commenter recommended that dQMs be developed using standardized data collection measures that enable end users to interact with quality measures in an interoperable and consistent format and to ensure consistency in the collection and data analysis. This commenter also recommended the use of Smart on FHIR apps using a FHIR Questionnaire to enable powerful data capture, reduce burden, and that would allow for the continuous data driven development of quality measures over time, with the softwarehardware layers providing greater stability. One commenter recommended that CMS add a digital measure confirming the presence and accessibility of advance directive information. Several commenters expressed concerns about shifting to a FHIR-based application programming interface including that the utility of an ESRD-specific FHIR standard outside of quality reporting to CMS is limited, it introduces complicating factors, the burden may outweigh the benefit with CMS current focus on CROWNWeb and EQRS, it may not achieve the data flow intended by CMS for the dialysis industry, and that shifting to a new system does not make sense at this time. One commenter expressed caution about the adoption of FHIR noting that the current ESRD quality data submission process captures 90 percent of data electronically and recommended piloting the FHIR approach to ensure that FHIR improves quality reporting over and above EQRS. One commenter recommended that CMS consider the burden on facilities related to compliance, noted implementation uncertainties, and recommended CMS allocate resources to help with the transition to new data systems and processes. One commenter expressed concerns with transitioning the ESRD programs to another platform and recommended that interoperability standards should be incorporated into the EQRS. One commenter recommended that CMS not reinvent the wheel but rather continue to work with the kidney care community to address the next generation of quality and data policies. Response We appreciate all of the comments on and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of our transition to digital quality measurement in CMS quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by 2025. We will continue to take all comments into account as we develop future regulatory proposals or other guidance for our digital quality measurement efforts. Changes Under Consideration To Advance Digital Quality Measurement Actions in Four Areas To Transition to Digital Quality Measures by 2025  We sought feedback on the following as described in section IV.G.3.c 1. of this final rule--Do you agree with the goal of aligning data needed for quality measurement with that required for interoperability? What are the strengths and limitations of this approach?--How important is a data standardization approach that also supports inclusion of PGHD and other currently non-standardized data?--What are possible approaches for testing data quality and validity? We received comments on these topics. Comments Several commenters expressed support for the goal of aligning data needed with interoperability. One commenter expressed its belief that quality measurement data must be aligned with and based on tools and methods of interoperability within healthcare believing this is core to the achievement of value-based healthcare. This commenter also noted its belief that aligning the incentives for all major stakeholders in healthcare patients, providers, payers, regulators is key to enabling a robust healthcare system and that when quality is measured according to the patient through the proxy measures of outcomes and cost of care, having data that are interoperable among these stakeholders is crucial. One commenter expressed support conceptually for the goal of aligning data, but needed more clarity on the specific quality measures CMS is considering for these purposes. One commenter recommended approaches for standardization including that CMS develop 1 Standard sets of outcomes measures only utilize validated PROMs as defined by ISOQOL validation guidelines 2 strictly defined standard sets standardized outcome definition including allowed response options, validated PROMs and defined data collection time points ensures consistency in data collection and allow for consistent data quality checks and 3 variables used in standard sets mapped to SNOMEDLOINC concepts allow for in-depth data validity audits. One commenter recommended that CMS establish guidance to ensure data security and to define roles and responsibilities regarding data validation and data cleaning. This commenter also noted that data validation and cleaning is currently managed by third party intermediaries and is necessary to maintain measure integrity and for reducing provider burden. One commenter expressed its concerns with standardization including burden on providers and questioned the value of moving from a standardized data format that already serves 90 percent of the dialysis community to an interoperability format that is standardized for data movement between providers beyond the dialysis industry. A few commenters expressed concerns with the inclusion of patient generated health data and other currently non-standardized data into a data standardized approach. One commenter noted that CMS definition of patient gathered health data is overly broad. One commenter expressed its belief that such data elements will vary by therapeutic area and be difficult to standardize. One commenter expressed its belief that additional research is needed prior to integration of patient-generated health data into quality measurement believing that while the data can augment the overall picture of health, it can be full of bias, noise, and variability. Response We appreciate all of the comments on and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of our transition to digital quality measurement in CMS quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by 2025. We will continue to take all comments into account as we develop future regulatory proposals or other guidance for our digital quality measurement efforts.  We sought feedback on the following as described in section IV.G.3.c 2. of this final rule--What functionalities, described in section IV.G.3.c 2. of this final rulePage 61947or others, should quality measure tools ideally have in the context of the pending availability of standardized and interoperable data for example, standardized EHR data available via FHIR-based APIs?--How would this more open, agile strategy for end-to-end measure calculation facilitate broader engagement in quality measure development, the use of tools developed for measurement for local quality improvement, andor the application of quality tools for related purposes such as public health or research? We received comments on these topics. Comments One commenter recommended common measure sets that gather data based on standard ontologies for example, ICD-10, SNOMED-CT believing that the use of resources that enable the use of shareable, digital data need be part of quality measure tools. The commenter also noted that the use of such measure sets, such as ICHOM Standard Sets, are also essential when on FHIR in a fully interoperable context. One commenter expressed its belief that broader engagement would lead to incremental gains on quality measure development noting that CMS already provides its contracted measure developers with access to the CROWNWeb and EQRS data for measure development and to the community via USRDS, an NIH sponsored registry, and noted that FHIR API may provide these data in a timelier fashion than providing data files. One commenter noted that international experience has shown that open cycle work groups, developed under an agile method, leads to the establishment of value based healthcare in a manner that works best for patient outcomes, and in a manner that develops the standards in a way that is independent to the payment rate-setting development process, which can lead to better outcomes for patients and better methods for data collection for providers. This commenter also expressed its belief that making measure collection seamless through the use of standard ontologies and FHIR-based API apps will allow both large scale data collection for use in value-based healthcare initiatives and the local usage of data for improvement of care as well as reducing reporting burden. One commenter expressed concern that the investments and progress the ESRD community has made to develop the current digital quality framework would be reversed with the adoption of a third new digital quality measurement approach. Response We appreciate all of the comments on and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of our transition to digital quality measurement in CMS quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by 2025. We will continue to take all comments into account as we develop future regulatory proposals or other guidance for our digital quality measurement efforts.  We sought feedback on the following as described in section IV.G.3.c 3. of this final rule--Do you have feedback on policy considerations for aggregation of data from multiple sources being used to inform measurement?--Do you have feedback on the role data aggregators can and should play in CMS quality measure reporting in collaboration with providers? How can CMS best facilitate and enable aggregation? We received comments on these topics. Comments One commenter expressed support for CMS gathering data from multiple sources to inform quality measurement however, this commenter also expressed caution about the use of FHIR API as the most appropriate digital data collection method. One commenter expressed its belief that CMS is best served to very early define the format in which they need to have the measures reported and that an open publication of the requested data formats and annotation, for example, a common data model, is the key to initiate a health market adjustment. This commenter recommended that CMS set forth policy that requires the collection of data using standardized measure sets, based on easily collectable data using standard ontologies and PGHD tools, and transported using the FHIR interoperable transport API. A few commenters expressed their belief that aggregation of data from multiple sources is not an issue for the renal community noting the use of CROWNWeb, EQRS, and HIE. A few commenters expressed their concerns with the use of data aggregators. One commenter expressed its concerns that moving to an undefined new standard under FHIR will require significant additional investments from industry when such investments already have been made to create the highly efficient HIE and other means of electronic data submission. One commenter expressed its belief that there is no need for data aggregators for the ESRD quality program because of existing data standardization and availability of required data in provider EMRs or CMS claims data noting the successful ability of 90 percent of the industry to submit data electronically in a standard format via batch, and the remaining 10 percent to do the same via manual interface however, this commenter also noted that if CMS requires data elements that are not able to be collected by dialysis providers then data aggregators may be helpful. Response We appreciate all of the comments on and interest in this topic. We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of our transition to digital quality measurement in CMS quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by 2025. We will continue to take all comments into account as we develop future regulatory proposals or other guidance for our digital quality measurement efforts.  We sought feedback on the following as described in section IV.G.3.c 4. of this final rule--What are initial priority areas for the dQM portfolio for example, measurement areas, measure requirements, tools?--We also sought to identify opportunities to collaborate with other Federal agencies, states, and the private sector to adopt standards and technology-driven solutions to address our quality measurement priorities and across sectors. We received comments on these topics. Comments One commenter recommended that the priority areas for the dQM portfolio be around health equity and quality measures for which data supports that additional access to care can improve quality outcomes. A few commenters had recommendations for CMS collaboration related to adopting standards and technology-driven solutions. One commenter recommended opportunities to collaborate with the Social Security Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the United Network for Organ Sharing. One commenter recommended collaboration with an objective, independent and patient centered non-profit organization that collaborates with patients and healthcare professionals. One commenter recommended that CMS work with states and other Federal agencies who might require these same data elements as an API from EQRS then that could create benefit and reduce administrative burden. Response We appreciate all of the comments on and interest in this topic.Page 61948We believe that this input is very valuable in the continuing development of our transition to digital quality measurement in CMS quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs by 2025. We will continue to take all comments into account as we develop future regulatory proposals or other guidance for our digital quality measurement efforts.V. End-Stage Renal Disease Treatment Choices ETC ModelA. Background1. Overview of the ETC Model As described in the Specialty Care Models final rule 85 FR 61114, beneficiaries with ESRD are among the most medically fragile and high-cost populations served by the Medicare program. ESRD Beneficiaries require dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive, and the majority of ESRD Beneficiaries receiving dialysis receive hemodialysis in an ESRD facility. However, as described in the Specialty Care Models final rule, alternative renal replacement modalities to in-center hemodialysis, including home dialysis and kidney transplantation, are associated with improved clinical outcomes, better quality of life, and lower costs than in-center hemodialysis 85 FR 61264. Section 1115A of the Act authorizes the Innovation Center to test innovative payment and service delivery models expected to reduce Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP expenditures while preserving or enhancing the quality of care furnished to such programs beneficiaries. The purpose of the ETC Model is to test the effectiveness of adjusting certain Medicare payments to ESRD facilities and Managing Clinicians to encourage greater utilization of home dialysis and kidney transplantation, support beneficiary modality choice, reduce Medicare expenditures, and preserve or enhance the quality of care. The ETC Model is a mandatory payment model, as we seek to test the effect of payment incentives on availability and choice of treatment modality among a diverse group of providers and suppliers. ESRD facilities and Managing Clinicians are selected as ETC Participants based on their location in Selected Geographic Areas--a set of 30 percent of Hospital Referral Regions HRRs that have been randomly selected to be included in the ETC Model, as well as HRRs with at least 20 percent of component ZIP codes 260 located in Maryland. CMS excludes all U.S Territories from the Selected Geographic Areas.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 260 ZIP codeTM is a trademark of the United States Postal Service.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under the ETC Model, ETC Participants are subject to two payment adjustments. The first is the Home Dialysis Payment Adjustment HDPA, which is an upward adjustment on certain payments made to participating ESRD facilities under the ESRD PPS on home dialysis claims, and an upward adjustment to the MCP paid to participating Managing Clinicians on home dialysis-related claims. The HDPA applies to claims with claim service dates beginning in January 1, 2021, and ending on December 31, 2023. The second payment adjustment under the ETC Model is the Performance Payment Adjustment PPA. For the PPA, we assess ETC Participants home dialysis rate and transplant rate during a Measurement Year MY, which includes 12 months of performance data. Each MY overlaps with the previous MY, if any, and the subsequent MY, if any, for a period of 6 months. Each MY has a corresponding PPA Period--a 6-month period which begins 6 months after the conclusion of the MY. We adjust certain payments for ETC Participants during the PPA Period based on the ETC Participants home dialysis rate and transplant rate, calculated as the sum of the transplant waitlist rate and the living donor transplant rate, during the corresponding MY. Based on an ETC Participants achievement in relation to benchmarks based on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate observed in Comparison Geographic Areas during the Benchmark Year, and the ETC Participants improvement in relation to its own home dialysis rate and transplant rate during the Benchmark Year, we make an upward or downward adjustment to certain payments to the ETC Participant. The magnitude of the positive and negative PPAs for ETC Participants increases over the course of the ETC Model. These PPAs apply to claims with claim service dates beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2027.2. Summary of Proposed Changes to the ETC Model The proposed rule, titled Medicare Program End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System, Payment for Renal Dialysis Services Furnished to Individuals With Acute Kidney Injury End-Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Program, and End-Stage Renal Disease Treatment Choices Model 85 FR 36322 through 36437, referred to herein as the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, was published in the Federal Register on July 9, 2021. In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, we proposed a number of policy changes to the ETC Model beginning for the third Measurement Year MY3 of the Model, which begins January 1, 2022. We proposed changes to the methodology for attributing Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries to Managing Clinicians to better reflect the care relationship between beneficiaries who receive pre-emptive LDT transplants and the Managing Clinicians who provide their care. We proposed to include nocturnal in-center dialysis in the numerator of the home dialysis rate calculation for ESRD facilities not owned in whole or in part by a large dialysis organization LDO as well as Managing Clinicians, to incentivize additional alternative renal replacement modalities. In addition, we proposed to exclude beneficiaries who are diagnosed with and receiving treatment with chemotherapy or radiation for vital solid organ cancers from the transplant rate to align with common transplant center requirements. We proposed to modify the PPA achievement benchmarking methodology to increase achievement benchmarks by 10 percent above rates observed in Comparison Geographic Areas every two MYs, beginning for MY3 2022. We proposed to stratify PPA achievement benchmarks based on the proportion of attributed beneficiaries who are dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid or receive the LIS during the MY, and to introduce the Health Equity Incentive to the PPA improvement scoring methodology, both in an effort to encourage ETC Participants to address disparities in renal replacement modality choice among beneficiaries with lower socioeconomic status. We proposed to modify the PPA improvement benchmarking and scoring methodology to ensure an ETC Participant can receive an improvement score even if its home dialysis rate or transplant rate was zero during the relevant Benchmark Year. We proposed to add processes and requirements for CMS to share certain model data with ETC Participants. We also proposed an additional programmatic waiver as necessary solely for purposes of allowing Managing Clinicians who are ETC participants to furnish kidney disease patient education services via telehealth under the ETC Model. In addition, we proposed to permit Managing Clinicians who are ETC Participants to reduce or waive beneficiary coinsurance for kidney disease patient education services, subject to certain requirements. In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, we stated our expectation that the proposed changes would continue toPage 61949promote the larger goals of increased renal replacement modality choice and are based on many of the issues we laid out in the Specialty Care Models final rule as issues for which CMS was considering further rulemaking, including updating benchmarks for ETC Participants and adjusting model parameters based on our implementation experience 86 FR 36376.3. Impact of the Changes on the ETC Model Evaluation As we described in the Specialty Care Models final rule, an evaluation of the ETC Model will be conducted in accordance with section 1115Ab4 of the Act, which requires the Secretary to evaluate each model tested by the Innovation Center. We noted that we believe an independent evaluation of the Model is necessary to understand the impacts of the Model on quality of care and Medicare program expenditures 85 FR 61345. In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36376, we proposed to update the evaluation plan presented in the Specialty Care Models final rule to account for all the policies in that proposed rule, if finalized. However, we noted that changes in the construction of the PPA would have no impact on the evaluation approach to analyzing the final PPA values. This is because the evaluation plan already includes a consideration of the final PPA values, rather than an evaluation of each step in the PPA calculation. However, we stated our expectation that we would conduct subgroup analyses in the evaluation to determine the effect of the proposed Health Equity Incentive, if finalized, in reducing health disparities among beneficiaries with lower socioeconomic status. As part of the detailed economic analysis included in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule and in section VIII.D.4 of this final rule, the transplant waitlist benchmarks were annually inflated by approximately 3-percentage points growth. This was a change from the Specialty Care Models final rule 85 FR 61352, in which the waitlist benchmarks were annually inflated by approximately 2-percentage points growth observed during years 2017 through 2019 to project rates of growth. By increasing the expected effect to a 3-percentage point change, we improve our ability to detect such an effect at the ETC Models current size. In the Specialty Care Models final rule, we stated that to detect a 2-percentage point increase in the transplant waitlist rate, we would need 30 percent of the 306 HRRs in order to detect an effect of this size with 80 percent power and an alpha of 0.05 Further, we stated that a model of this size would be large enough to detect a one and one-half percentage point change in the home dialysis rate 85 FR 61280. In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36376, we clarified that our unadjusted power calculations show that the model requires 30 percent of the 306 HRRs to detect the one and one-half percentage point change in the home dialysis rate with 80 percent power and an alpha of 0.05 Given the updated expectation that the transplant waitlist rate is likely to increase by 3-percentage points as a result of the ETC Model, the power analysis shows the evaluation would also have sufficient sample size to detect, as statistically significant, a 3-percentage point change in the transplant waitlist rate with 80 percent power and an alpha of 0.05 We did not receive any comments regarding our proposal to update the evaluation plan presented in the Specialty Care Models final rule to account for all the policies in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, if finalized. We are therefore finalizing our proposal and will modify the model evaluation to analyze the impact of the policies finalized in this final rule.B. Summary of the Proposed Provisions, Public Comments, Responses to Comments, and Finalized Policies for the ETC Model The CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on July 9, 2021, with a comment period that ended on August 31, 2021. In that proposed rule, we proposed to make a number of changes to the ETC Model, to begin January 1, 2022, as described previously in section I.B.4 of this rule. We received 64 timely public comments on our proposals, including comments from ESRD facilities national renal, nephrologist, and patient organizations patients manufacturers health care systems and individual clinicians, including nephrologists, nurses, and social workers. We also received comments related to issues that we did not discuss in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule. These include, for example, comments recommending that CMS incorporate staff-assisted home dialysis into the ETC Model, support the training and education of home dialysis nurses, and including transplant providers as ETC Participants. These comments expressed concern over implementing home dialysis programs or the negative payment adjustments included in the Model. While we are generally not addressing those comments in this final rule, we thank the commenters for their input and may consider their recommendations in future rulemaking. In this final rule, we provide a summary of each proposed provision, a summary of the public comments received and our responses to them, and the policies we are finalizing for the ETC Model. These policies take effect January 1, 2022, unless otherwise specified. Comment Many commenters supported the goals of the ETC Model. Some of these commenters stated that they appreciate the effort to advance home dialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic since dialyzing at home allows patients to socially distance and avoid going into hospitals or medical centers. Response We thank the commenters for the support of the Models goals. Comment One commenter suggested that CMS implement the ETC Model nationwide in order to improve quality of care for all ESRD beneficiaries. Response Section 1115A of the Act authorizes the Secretary to test payment and service delivery models intended to reduce Medicare costs while preserving or improving care quality that, if effective, are considered for expansion to the Medicare program. As noted in the Specialty Care Models final rule 85 FR 61280, the randomized selection of 30 percent of HRRs allows CMS sufficient statistical power to assess the effect of the ETC Model. If the test of the ETC Model satisfies the criteria for expansion in section 1115Ac of the Act, CMS may consider expanding the duration and scope of the ETC Model, including on a nationwide basis. Comment One commenter suggested that the ETC Model be an Advanced Alternative Payment Model APM allowing ETC Participants to be eligible as qualifying APM participants QP, similar to what is proposed for the Radiation Oncology RO Model. Regarding the commenters reference to the RO Model, we finalized our proposal that the RO Model be designed to qualify as an Advanced APM and MIPS APM in the Specialty Care Models final rule 85 FR 61231 through 61238. Response As noted in the Specialty Care Models final rule 85 FR 61326, modifying the ETC Model to be an Advanced APM would subject ETC Participants to significant downside risk from the outset, which we believe would put many ETC Participants in a difficult financial position. As further noted in the Specialty Care Models final rule 85 FR 61274, Managing Clinicians may simultaneously participate in the ETC Model and the complementary Kidney Care Choices Model, a voluntaryPage 61950model we anticipate will meet the criteria to be an Advanced APM beginning in 2022. Comment Several commenters urged that patients should have the choice of modality that works best for them, and the ETC Model should support patient choices. Response We appreciate the commenters feedback to support beneficiary choice of treatment modality. The ETC Model, as described in the Specialty Care Models final rule, aims to support beneficiaries choosing alternatives to in-center dialysis. Additionally, ETC Participants are subject to provisions protecting beneficiary freedom of choice set forth at Sec. 512.120 of our regulations, as discussed in the Specialty Care Models final rule 85 FR 61339.1. Technical Clarifications For ESRD facilities that are ETC Participants, the ETC Model makes certain upward and downward adjustments to the Adjusted ESRD PPS per Treatment Base Rate for certain dialysis claims via the Home Dialysis Payment Adjustment HDPA and the Performance Payment Adjustment PPA. The term Adjusted ESRD PPS per Treatment Base Rate is defined at 42 CFR 512.310 as the per-treatment payment amount as defined in Sec. 413.230 of this chapter, including patient-level adjustments and facility-level adjustments, and excluding any applicable training adjustment, add-on payment amount, outlier payment amount, TDAPA amount, and TPNIES amount. In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36376, we clarified the claims that are subject to adjustment under the ETC Model. Specifically, as Sec. 413.230 is specific to the calculation of payment amounts under the ESRD PPS, we clarify that the HDPA and PPA do not apply to claims from ESRD facilities that are not paid under ESRD PPS and are instead paid through other Medicare payment systems. We are also updating the name of one of the sources of data used throughout the ETC Model. In the Specialty Care Models final rule, we specified that one source of data for the ETC Model is CROWNWeb, a data management system that CMS uses to collect data from ESRD facilities 85 FR 61317. As we explained in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36376, since publication of the Specialty Care Models final rule, CMS has replaced CROWNWeb with the End Stage Renal Disease Quality Reporting System EQRS. As such, we will refer to CROWNWeb for data that was generated before the change to EQRS, which CMS began using in 2020, and EQRS for data that was generated after the change to EQRS. The following is a summary of the comments received on our technical clarifications related to claims subject to adjustment under the ETC Model and the replacement of CROWNWeb data with EQRS data and our responses. Comment A few commenters stated that they support the technical clarification that the HDPA and PPA do not apply to claims from ESRD facilities that are not paid under ESRD PPS and are instead paid through other Medicare payment systems. Response We appreciate commenters support for this technical clarification. Comment A few commenters stated that they support the technical clarification that the ETC Model will refer to EQRS data in place of CROWNWeb data. Response We appreciate commenters support for this technical clarification. Comment A few commenters expressed concerns related to the challenges faced during the transition from CROWNWeb to EQRS, and resulting concerns over data quality. Response As discussed elsewhere in this final rule, we are aware of concerns related to the transition from CROWNWeb to EQRS. For the purposes of the ETC Model, we will continue to use the best data available and will work with ETC Participants to address any data issues that arise.2. Performance Payment Adjustment PPA Beneficiary Attribution for Living Kidney Donor Transplants In the Specialty Care Models final rule 85 FR 61297, we established that beneficiaries are attributed to Managing Clinicians for the purposes of calculating the home dialysis rate and transplant rate. For the home dialysis rate and the transplant waitlist and living donor kidney transplant portions of the transplant rate, as described in 42 CFR 512.360c2i, an ESRD Beneficiary is generally attributed to the Managing Clinician with the earliest monthly capitation payment MCP claim billed during the month. If more than one Managing Clinician submits a claim for the MCP furnished to a single ESRD Beneficiary with the same earliest claim service date at the claim line through date for the month, the ESRD Beneficiary is randomly attributed to one of these Managing Clinicians. However, a beneficiary who receives a pre-emptive living donor transplant Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary is not on dialysis and therefore cannot be attributed to a Managing Clinician using an MCP claim. As a result, under Sec. 512.360c2ii, a Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary is generally attributed to the Managing Clinician with whom the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary had the most claims between the start of the MY and the month of the transplant. If no Managing Clinician has had the plurality of claims for a given Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary such that multiple Managing Clinicians each had the same number of claims for that beneficiary during the MY, the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary is attributed to the Managing Clinician associated with the latest claim service date during the MY up to and including the month of the transplant, as described in Sec. 512.360c2iiA. If no Managing Clinician had the plurality of claims for a given Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary such that multiple Managing Clinicians each had the same number of services for that beneficiary during the MY, and more than one of those Managing Clinicians had the latest claim service date during the MY up to and including the month of the transplant, the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary is randomly attributed to one of these Managing Clinicians, as described in Sec. 512.360c2iiB. As stated in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36377, upon further review of the beneficiary attribution methodology for living donor kidney transplants, we realized that an unintended consequence of the current attribution methodology is that Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries may be attributed to the nephrologist who manages their transplant, not the Managing Clinician who has seen them through the living donor transplant process. As stated in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule, to avoid this effect, CMS believes it is necessary to update the attribution methodology for Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries. Living donor transplants are relatively rare events that require nephrologist support over time in order to inform beneficiaries of their transplant options and to assist them in finding a living donor. However, the current Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary attribution methodology is based on visits from the beginning of a MY. As a result, if a Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary has a transplant early in a MY, the beneficiary may be attributed to a transplant nephrologist who may have had only a single visit with the beneficiary, rather than the Managing Clinician who oversaw the largest share of the care that led to the beneficiary receiving the living donor transplant. As a result, we proposed to update the attribution methodology for Pre-emptivePage 61951LDT Beneficiaries to Managing Clinicians, beginning for MY3, in new provisions at Sec. 512.360c2iii. Rather than attributing a Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary to the Managing Clinician with the plurality of claims from the start of the MY and the month of the transplant, beginning for MY3, we proposed to attribute Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries to the Managing Clinician with whom the beneficiary has had the most claims during the 365 days prior to the transplant date. Further, we proposed that if no Managing Clinician has had the most claims for the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary such that multiple Managing Clinicians each had the same number of claims for that beneficiary in the 365 days preceding the date of the transplant, the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary would be attributed to the Managing Clinician associated with the latest claim service date at the claim line through date during the 365 days preceding the date of the transplant. We proposed that if more than one of those Managing Clinicians had the latest claim service date at the claim line through date during the 365 days preceding the date of the transplant, the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary would be randomly attributed to one of these Managing Clinicians. We proposed that the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary would be considered eligible for attribution to a Managing Clinician under this proposed new Sec. 512.360c2iii if the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary has at least 1 eligible-month during the 12-month period that includes the month of the transplant and the 11 months prior to the transplant month. We proposed that an eligible month would refer to a month during which the Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary not does not meet exclusion criteria in Sec. 512.360b. We proposed changes for Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary attribution to Managing Clinicians in order to identify and attribute Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries to the Managing Clinician who assisted the Beneficiary through the living donor transplant process. We sought comment on these proposed changes for Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary attribution to Managing Clinicians beginning for MY3 in proposed new Sec. 512.360c2iii. The following is a summary of the comments received on the proposed changes for Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary attribution to Managing Clinicians beginning for MY3 and our responses. Comment Several commenters supported our proposal to update the attribution methodology for Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries to Managing Clinicians to identify and attribute Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries to the Managing Clinician that assisted the Beneficiary through the living donor transplant process. Response We appreciate the support and feedback. Comment A few commenters expressed that the proposed changes to the attribution methodology for Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries would have a limited impact, due to the small number of Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries. Response We appreciate the feedback from commenters and recognize the small number of Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries. We nonetheless believe it is necessary to update this methodology to ensure that those Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries are attributed to the Managing Clinician who oversaw the largest share of the care that led to the beneficiary receiving the living donor transplant to more accurately measure Managing Clinician performance. Final Rule Action After considering public comments, we are finalizing our proposal in our regulation at Sec. 512.360c2iii to change Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiary attribution to Managing Clinicians beginning for MY3, without modification.3. PPA Home Dialysis Ratea. Background on Home Dialysis Rate Calculation A primary goal of the ETC Model is to support beneficiary modality choice by encouraging ETC Participants to support beneficiaries in selecting alternatives to in-center dialysis. Under 42 CFR 512.365b, CMS includes in-center self-dialysis treatment beneficiary years in the numerator of the home dialysis rate. Specifically, the home dialysis rate for both Managing Clinicians and ESRD facilities is calculated as the number of dialysis treatment beneficiary years during the MY in which attributed beneficiaries received dialysis at home, plus one half of the total number of dialysis treatment beneficiary years during the MY in which the attributed beneficiaries received self-dialysis in center. As described in the Specialty Care Models final rule, we included self-dialysis in the home dialysis rate calculation because we believe in-center self-dialysis may provide a gradual transition from in-center to home dialysis, and provide beneficiaries with the time needed to get comfortable conducting dialysis by themselves, under medical supervision 85 FR 61306. The denominator for the home dialysis rate is the total dialysis treatment beneficiary years for attributed ESRD beneficiaries during the MY, as described in Sec. Sec. 512.365b1i and 512.365b2i. This includes the months during which attributed beneficiaries received maintenance dialysis at home or in an ESRD facility.b. Nocturnal Dialysis Nocturnal in-center dialysis is a form of in-center dialysis conducted overnight for extended hours while the beneficiary is asleep. This dialysis is longer and slower than traditional in-center dialysis, can take more than 5 hours per treatment, and can be performed 3 to 7 days a week. As this type of in-center dialysis is conducted overnight, it allows the beneficiary more time and flexibility to have a continuous job, as well as a social and family life.261--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 261 Wilk, Adam S., Lea, Janice P. 2019.

Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 23, 479-485. doi10.1111hdi.12782 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dialysis conducted at a slower rate over a longer period of time is also associated with positive health impacts in comparison to traditional dialysis, including improved blood pressure control, better phosphate control, better management of anemia and bone and mineral metabolism, improved cardiovascular disease, increases in urea reduction ratio, and better beneficiary quality of life measures.262 263 264 265 266--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 262 Burton, J. and Graham-Brown, M., 2018.

PMID 22106828.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition to the clinical benefits, nocturnal in-center dialysis also provides an alternative to traditional in-center dialysis for those beneficiaries for whom home dialysis is not an optionPage 61952due to limited financial resources, housing insecurity, lack of social support, or personal preference. For example, a beneficiary experiencing housing insecurity may be unable to dialyze at home due to inability to receive and store home dialysis materials. However, that beneficiary could receive nocturnal in-center dialysis, thereby receiving the clinical benefits of a longer, slower dialysis process and the flexibility associated with not having to receive traditional in-center dialysis during the day.267 268--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 267 Bugeja A, Dacouris N, Thomas A, Marticorena R, McFarlane P, Donnelly S, Goldstein M.

PMID 22106828.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- While nocturnal in-center dialysis offers some of the same clinical and quality of life benefits as home dialysis in comparison to traditional in-center dialysis, use of nocturnal in-center dialysis is rare. Based on analyses described in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule and in section VIII.D.4.e of this final rule, less than 1 percent of beneficiaries eligible for attribution to ETC Participants were receiving self-dialysis or nocturnal in-center dialysis in 2019. Potential limitations to nocturnal in-center dialysis utilization include supply factors. At present, few ESRD facilities offer nocturnal dialysis in 2019, approximately 1 percent of ESRD facilities furnished nocturnal in-center dialysis based on our analysis of claims data. ESRD facilities may face staffing challenges to initiating a nocturnal dialysis program. Potential limitations to nocturnal in-center dialysis also include demand factors Beneficiaries may be unaware of nocturnal in-center dialysis, or may be averse to sleeping at an ESRD facility or experience difficulty sleeping while receiving dialysis.269--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 269 Ibid.---------------------------------------------------------------------------c. Inclusion of Nocturnal In-Center Dialysis in Home Dialysis Rate We proposed to modify the home dialysis rate calculation, for ETC Participants that are either ESRD facilities not owned in whole or in part by an LDO or Managing Clinicians, to include nocturnal in-center dialysis in the numerator beginning for MY3. As described in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule and previously in this section of the final rule, we believe this modality allows beneficiaries to continue to receive maintenance dialysis in an ESRD facility under medical supervision, but at a time of day that is more convenient for them, and in a manner that is associated with improved health outcomes. In particular, in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36378, we stated our belief that including nocturnal in-center dialysis in the home dialysis rate may improve access to alternative renal replacement modalities for beneficiaries who are unable to dialyze at home. In addition to promoting access to the benefits of additional alternative renal replacement modalities for ESRD Beneficiaries who may not be able to dialyze at home, in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule we stated our belief that including nocturnal in-center dialysis in the calculation of the home dialysis rate offers an additional pathway to success for ETC Participants with more limited resources. As described in the Specialty Care Models final rule, we received comments that some ESRD facilities, particularly independent ESRD facilities or ESRD facilities owned by small dialysis organizations, may be unable to develop and maintain a home dialysis program 85 FR 61322 through 61324. Operating a home dialysis program requires specialized staff, as well as upfront investment in additional equipment and certification. Establishing a nocturnal in-center dialysis program does not require additional equipment or certification, and may be more feasible for independent ESRD facilities or ESRD facilities owned by small dialysis organizations, and by extension, the Managing Clinicians who serve their patients. In the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule 86 FR 36378, we considered including nocturnal in-center dialysis in the numerator of the home dialysis rate for ESRD facilities owned in whole or in part by LDOs as well. However, we noted in the CY 2022 ESRD PPS proposed rule that we do not believe that ESRD facilities owned in whole or in part by LDOs face the same resource constraints in establishing a home dialysis program as independent ESRD facilities or ESRD facilities owned by small dialysis organizations. ESRD facilities owned in whole or in part by LDOs may be more likely to have access to a home dialysis program, either in the ESRD facility itself or within the network of facilities owned by the same parent company in that facilitys aggregation group. ESRD facilities owned in whole or in part by LDOs may also have greater access to the upfront capital necessary to establish a home dialysis program if they do not already have, or have access to, a home dialysis program.",housing insecurity

Dave, a fintech company that helps customers avoid overdrafts by providing small, interest-free cash advances, thinks it may have a solution. The Los Angeles-based company, backed by investors including MarkCuban, the DJ Diplo, and hedge fund Mark 2 Capital, said on Tuesday its rolling out a new checking account product that reports all rent payments to credit agencies. The new feature, added to Daves original app, helps customers to build their credit. Dave plans to begin reporting utility payments later this summer. Dave also said Tuesday that its raised 110 million in debt led by Victory Park Capital, bringing its total fundraising to 136.3 million of funding with a mix of debt and equity. Daves credit-building feature is provided by an exclusive partnership with CreditPop, a company that reports a tenants rent payments to credit bureaus in order to build their credit. CreditPop charges 120 a year for the service, but Dave is providing it for free to any customers who directly deposit their paycheck into their Dave account.

In a survey earlier this year, large banks rated challenger banks as the biggest disruptive threat to their business.7 But the Dave app already has a head start. It was ranked as the 14th most popular app on the Apple App store and the 12th most popular on the Google Play store as of Tuesday. Daves app also provides users with a forecast of what their account balance will look like before next payday by analyzing their monthly bills. For example, if a users bank account says that they have 1,700 in their account on Monday, but their 1,500 rent will be coming out on Wednesday, the app will send an alert that they only have 200 to spend until payday on Friday. Daves short term-cash advances also allow customers to borrow up to 100 every pay-period without any interest. After depositing 100 in their account, the app removes the 100 the customer borrowed out of their next paycheck, and asks the customer if they want to leave an optional tip. Users can also access a list of available gig-economy jobs in their area within Dave, and then can click on a list of links in their app that will begin the process of signing the user up for the job. Dave is partnered with 20 companies, including Instacart. Natalie Rix, Daves communication director, said that over 200,000 Dave users have already used the app to connect with gig-economy employers.

These immigrants are a vital and productive part of our states economy and are active in a variety of industries, including technology, biotech, hospitality, agriculture, construction, services, transportation, and textiles.They also represent a large share of our new small business owners and create economic prosperity and needed jobs for everyone.Keeping these families, business owners, and hard workers in the shadows of society serves no one.Our state, for economic, social, health, security, and prosperity reasons, must support policies that allow individuals to become legal and enfranchised participants in our society and economy.Comprehensive immigration reform should include a reasonable and timely path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who are already living and working in the United States.Immigration reform should also include comprehensive background checks, require demonstrated proficiency in English and payment of all current and back taxes, and have the flexibility to respond to emerging business trends.

Briefly, after 1 - 2 months of SUD treatment, 300 subjects men and women, aged 20 through 50 years received integrated comprehensive dental treatment. Their treatment outcomes were compared with those of sex matched patients who were likewise treated for SUD but did not receive comprehensive oral health care. Results revealed that patients that received dental care had substantially elevated improvements including 1 an increase in rates of SUD treatment completion 2 an increase in drug abstinence 3 an increase in employment and 4 a reduction in homelessness. The purpose of the present study was to extend these findings by investigating if comprehensive dental care improves quality of life in individuals receiving Targeted Adult Medicaid TAM, which includes adult SUD patients receiving dental care, in a manner that correlates with the improved SUD treatment outcomes.",homelessness

Subsequent analyses focused on the clinical course of ASPD and AASB n  3080, as defined by the occurrence and age-related sequence of CD adult antisocial symptoms. Data showed that the first symptoms to appear were temper tantrums age 7 with the symptoms of bullying, defiance, fire setting, and cruelty to animals, occurring in the 10-11 age range, and fights, school expulsion, running away from home and school, telling lies and stealing occurring in the 11-15 age range. Between age 15 and 20 multiple aggressive acts such as fighting, stealing, robbery, use of force, injuring people, and using a weapon occurred. From age 20-30 yrs. evidence of role failure in participants as documented by them endorsing forging checks, failed financial responsibilities, homelessness, failed family responsibilities, as well as arrests, convicted felonies and time spent in jail. The clinical course of the 21 antisocial behaviors, with ages of onset, was determined comparing the mean age of each symptom using Spearmans rho and comparing the results based on race, diagnostic label, and sex. The clinical course was found to be highly significantly similar between the three races, the two sexes and the two diagnostic labels rho  0.925-0.978, p lt 0.001. However individual symptom counts were significantly different across the groups when they were compared using logistic regression, covaried for significant demographic variables. Women reported fewer symptoms, were less likely to report fights, school expulsions, arrests or jail time, but more likely than males to run away from home. Those with ASPD had more symptoms overall than those with AABS including being less likely to experience remorse.

scranton,Students flocked to cyber-charter schools this year. So did district revenue and federal relief funds,2021-04-14T00:00:00Z,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,The Scranton Times,"Betsy DeVos, at the time the U.S. Secretary of Education, told the press that the federal government would require schools to open for instruction in the fall. Her remarks came soon after the Wolf administration issued its first universal mask mandate, which raised the possibility that students and staff in school buildings would have to be masked all day. PA Cyber had thousands of enrollment inquiries from potential students when its staff returned from their week-long break, according to Hayden, the schools chief executive officer. Hayden said the school redeployed 40 staff members to help the enrollment office keep up with the overwhelming deluge of emails and phone calls. By the time the new school year began in August, it had hit its enrollment limit of nearly 12,000 students. When the pandemic shuttered Pennsylvanias classrooms last year, the states 14 cyber charter schools said they were uniquely qualified to help students thrive in their new world of online learning. Students and their families evidently agreed Enrollment in Pennsylvanias cyber charter schools shot up by 60 percent during the pandemic, from 38,000 students a year ago to 60,000 students today, data from the state Department of Education show. The rush of students to cyber charter schools has also brought an influx of cash - along with renewed calls from traditional public school advocates for the state to more closely scrutinize the cost of cyber charters, which perennially log some of the lowest academic performance in the state. Like brick and mortar charter schools, cyber charters are funded by contributions from public school districts. Districts pay the online schools an annual rate for each of their students who opt to enroll in one. District payments to charter schools have been rising steadily for a decade. But theyre expected to double this year, driven largely by a 350 million increase in contributions to cyber charter schools, according to the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials. Cyber charter schools are also due to be some of the leading recipients of federal funds that were intended to ease the transition to remote learning and mitigate learning loss among students.Thats despite the fact that cyber charter schools appealed to families by pledging dependability during the pandemic, saying they could spare children the disruptions that have plagued public schools for the last year. I dont want to go over the top, but its perplexing at best and appalling at worst, Temple University Law School professor Susan DeJarnatt said of the federal revenues slated to accrue to cyber charter schools this year. They dont have the same costs as brick and mortar schools. Everyone is affected by COVID, but Im sure they are the least affected of anyone in the public school system, DeJarnatt told the Capital-Star. Estimates from the Wolf administration show that 12 of the states cyber charter schools are due to receive a cumulative 151.9 million in cash subsidies from American Rescue Plan - the 1.9 trillion federal stimulus package that Congress approved in March, which sent 5 billion in one-time emergency relief aid to Pennsylvanias public school districts. Those one-time payments are the third installment that Pennsylvania schools are due to receive from the federal Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief ESSER fund. They come on top of 49 million in ESSER funds that cyber charters got from the federal stimulus package that passed in December. Cyber charter schools also received 10 million under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security CARES Act that passed last May. All told, the one-time cash infusions to cyber charters are due to exceed 211 million, not including the Paycheck Protection Loans that some of them claimed last year. When cyber charter schools were included in the first first round of emergency aid last summer, public school advocates questioned whether they should get a share. As the Pittsburgh-based news outlet PublicSource reported in June1, those funds were intended to help schools pivot to remote learning - something that cyber charter schools were already equipped to provide. The two subsequent allocations from the federal government grew in size and came with different rules. The 2.2 billion in emergency aid that Pennsylvania schools shared in December was supposed to support food programs and technology. Schools are still waiting on federal guidance for the more recent round of funding, but the state has told them to use at least some of it to address learning loss and support vulnerable populations - a segment that includes children with disabilities, English learners, and students experiencing homelessness. Public school advocates are still skeptical that cyber charter schools are needful recipients of the federal cash. Weve been hearing since the day that traditional schools closed that cyber charters were built for the pandemic, Susan Spicka, executive director of Education Voters of PA, which advocates for tighter regulation of all charter schools, said. If they were perfectly positioned and students werent losing learning, those things dont match up. Spicka doesnt take issue with the way the state has decided to distribute its federal dollars the formula they used relies on a schools Title-1 allocation, which weights federal funds towards schools that educate low-income students. But the state system has created an issue where charters have a lot of excess funding right now and school districts dont, Spicka said. Traditional public schools and even brick-and-mortar charter schools have had to retrofit facilities to accommodate in-person learning this year. Many have had to alter transportation schedules, too, so they could enforce social distancing on school buses or accommodate hybrid school schedules. A winter survey from PASBO found that most school districts have seen their costs skyrocket while state aid flatlines and local revenue sources slowed or declined. The emergency funds from the federal government may allow many to avoid tax hikes - at least in the short term. A Department of Education spokeswoman said its up to schools to apply for the federal aid, and that its unclear what would happen if a recipient wants to relinquish their share. Schools that receive ESSER funds have to report how they spend it and undergo an audit from the Department of Education if they get more than 750,000. Cyber charter schools say that their expenses have also increased as a result of the pandemic. Hayden says PA Cyber has made technology upgrades and hired more teachers and support staff. The school will likely cover the new personnel costs with revenue from public school districts, since federal relief funds are meant to be used for one-time expenses and programs. Hayden said PA Cyber intends to use all of its stimulus money in strict compliance with federal guidelines. And he expects there will be no shortage of initiatives that fall within its purview. PA Cyber has a sizable population of students who dont have stable housing, Hayden said, and administrators are preparing for their ranks to grow if federal eviction protections expire this year. The school has provided those students with cell phones and other equipment to ensure they have stable access to their learning materials. Hayden said educators are also preparing summer curriculum, which aims to prevent learning loss - a need he said could be particularly acute following a year that brought unemployment, illness and death to students homes. Weve been consistent with our reaching, that doesnt mean students home lives have been consistent, Hayden said. Were here teaching, but that doesnt mean learning is as good as we would like it to be. Commonwealth Charter Academy, which is slated to receive 24 million under the most recent stimulus package, also said it would spend the cash according to federal law, though a spokesperson didnt respond to follow-up questions about specific expenditures. Agora Cyber School did not respond to a request for comment. Hayden still admits that cyber charter schools have been blessed with good fortune this year. His school was already projecting a surplus when it set its budget last June. He says its typical for his school to end the year with a cushion, but expects that this years surplus will be bigger than in the past. Can I say that every dollar weve received in additional revenue has been needed for expenses? Hayden said. No, it has not.A silver lining?Cyber school proponents and their critics agree on at least two things right now that the pandemic is going to entrench remote learning in Pennsylvania, and that it will soon become much easier to assess the true cost of virtual education. Some students who sought refuge in cyber charters schools this year may return to their public schools if they reopen this fall. Whether that will translate into big enrollment fluctuations next year is the biggest crystal ball question that cyber schools are dealing with right now, Hayden said. But public school advocates such as Spicka think that pupils across the state will expect some degree of remote education, even if they stay enrolled in a district school. Hundreds of Pennsylvania school districts were offering remote learning options before the pandemic shuttered schools last year. Many more spun up online academies at the start of the current school year, hoping they could compete2 with cyber charters and keep students - and their attendant tuition dollars - in their district. Public school officials have long said that they can offer online instruction more cheaply than their cyber charter competitors. A 2018 analysis3 by the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators found that district-run cyber schools could educate students for an average of 5,000 per year - roughly half what it costs for them to send a child to a cyber charter school. That study didnt evaluate their academic outcomes for students. Charter critics such as DeJarnatt argue that cyber charter schools inflate the cost of educating children online. A paper that DeJarnatt published in January4 contends that Pennsylvanias current method for funding cyber charter schools provides them with more cash than they need to educate students. She further argues that weaknesses in the states charter school law allows them to spend excess funds on advertising and expensive management firms. DeJarnatts research relies on cyber charter schools federal tax filings and year-end budget reports. Reporters have also used public records requests5 to piece together their spending on advertising and gifts for families. But DeJarnatt said that a dearth of publicly available information makes it difficult to get a clear picture of their finances. Shed like to see the state conduct more regular, rigorous audits of cyber charter schools. A review by the Scranton Times-Tribune6 in December found that six of the states 14 cyber charter schools have never been reviewed by state auditors. A Department of Education spokeswoman also confirmed Tuesday that eleven cyber charter schools are technically operating under expired charters. Cyber charters expire after five years, at which point schools must apply to the state for renewal - a process that includes a comprehensive review of their student achievement and financial operations. State law allows charters to remain in effect pending their renewal. But charter operators have complained for years that their applications languish while awaiting review from state regulators. With a historic number of students now learning in online environments, DeJarnatt thinks its time for the state to redouble its efforts to regulate cyber charter schools. That should start, she said, by figuring out how much it really costs to educate a student online in Pennsylvania. Whether lawmakers want to convene a special commission to study the issue or tap an outside researcher, we really need to figure out what the cost actually is, DeJarnatt said. Maybe the only silver lining to this huge COVID cloud is we might have more information about what it costs to provide a virtual education, she added. Hayden thinks that the findings may not come out in school districts favor. Cyber charter operators say that their methods are time-tested Schools such as PA Cyber and Commonwealth Connection have been in business for two decades, with no shortage of demand for their enrollment slots. They also say parents should take criticism about their academic performance with a grain of salt. Cyber charter schools perennially log lower student test scores and graduation rates than typical public schools. And a 2019 study by Stanford University found that students in cyber charter schools learn less on average than their demographically identical peers in brick-and-mortar charter schools and district schools. Cyber executives such as Hayden attribute that to a highly transient student body. Cyber charters accept students at all points of the school year, from anywhere in the state, he said. They see high levels of churn as students opt out of traditional public schools. Hayden said that traditional public schools have dismissed cyber education as cheap and easy. But as soon as they had to offer comprehensive online learning themselves, we hear all of a sudden that its expensive and hard, Hayden said. Hopefully there is a better understanding now that we do know and we are good at what were doing.  1  2  3  4 38EXTpdfamp38INDEXTRUE  5  6",homelessness
