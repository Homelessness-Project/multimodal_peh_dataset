Council Member Scanlon. Present. Council Member Wingo. Present. Council Member Wyatt. Here. Forum present. Let's stand for the pledge. To the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands. under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. As we remain standing, we are pleased today to have with us the presiding prelate of the Roman Catholic Church here in our area, Bishop Malone, who will be introduced by our chaplain. As some of you will remember from last year, we brought Bishop in as a spiritual father of the region. to just address and to be able to give a blessing. And we've decided, his office and mine, to make it an annual tradition. So he's here for his annual time with us. And as he joins us, we recognize that a place that's going through as much transition and change as our city is needs to remember that in all the newness, there are some things that don't change. And fathers and mothers are free to their part of the important fabric, and I believe he's part of that. Thank you so much, too. And as you all know, as father of my own Catholic community, we have a number of serious challenges we're working on now. This situation we're in, I think you know, is kind of an unwanted situation. inheritance that's come to me from the past, the abuse cases. I assure you we're working assiduously on this thing to bring healing and renewal. But thank you. I don't want to get into that theme with you now, but thank you all for your great service to the people of our city. I do follow carefully what's going on, and I know the challenges. I don't know them like you know them, but I realize there's a lot to it, and what you do from our perspective is certainly God's work bringing about his kingdom. Let us pray. Almighty and eternal God, you know the longing of people's hearts and you protect their rights. In your goodness, watch over those in public office, especially those here, and bless the work of their hands so that the people of our city and our region may enjoy freedom, security and peace. We ask you, Father, that our elected representatives and appointed officials be surrounded by the with and protected by your light. We ask that their every thought, word and action reflect their very best selves and serve the highest good for our city, our region. By striving for the common good, may they secure peace and security for the people entrusted to their care. May they always seek the ways of righteousness, justice and mercy, Grant that they may be enabled by your powerful protection to lead and govern with honesty and integrity. Father, you have given all peoples one common origin. Fill the hearts of humankind with the fire of your love and with the desire to ensure justice for all. By sharing the good things you give us, may we secure an equality for all our brothers and sisters. May they be an end to division, to strife and war, to every form of violence and exclusion. Look with tender mercy upon all those who bear the indignities of injustice everywhere. Sharpen our intellects to pierce the pettiness of prejudice, to perceive the beauty of true human brotherhood and sisterhood. Guide our minds to a meaningful understanding of the problems of the poor, of the oppressed, of the unemployed, of all in need of assistance here in Buffalo and everywhere. Guard our hearts against the subtle lure of earthly things and undo regard for those who possess them. May we hunger and thirst after justice always as we seek to follow your holy will. And with confident faith and loving hope, we make this prayer in your holy name. Amen. Bishop, thank you for being a part of our gathering today. And you mentioned very quickly, but thank you for your integrity and transparency, accountability, and being a responsible leader in our community. Thank you. Councilmembers, any memorials? Councilmember Golomb√©. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Former Riverside resident Marge Whitroll passed away. She's going to be very, very sorely missed by her family and her friends. She's going to meet her husband, Eddie, who was a former Democratic, I believe, chairman in Riverside many, many years ago. Very, very good family. Anthony Tony Colicchia, also known as Mr. Pizza from Elmwood Avenue after a long illness passed away this past week. He was a good guy, generous guy. I've heard so many stories about him and the good that he did in his Westside community and beyond. Also, Russ McCarthy, a constituent of mine, passed away. another good guy you know neighborhood guy former saint john the baptist parishioner he's going to be very very sorely missed by his wife joan and his family and friends and last but certainly not least a very very good friend of mine that i got to know over the past several years roderick charles md dr charles passed away uh after he had a stroke about six months ago that he was overcoming. They had just moved down to Washington, DC area, and he unfortunately got sick while he was down there and in a matter of a few days, passed away. At the age of 90, Dr. Charles Rodd was one of the two first blacks to graduate from the University of Maryland at Baltimore with his medical doctorate, medical doctor. I used to have dinner with him on a regular basis, especially Thanksgiving dinner. And to give you the personality of him and the friendship and relationship that he and I had, I think I sort of kind of shared some of the story with you. I never knew that African Americans and macaroni and cheese was so important on Thanksgiving. Because I was always late to Thanksgiving dinner because I would volunteer at one of the churches in my district. So after several years, I... I got there on time the one year because they stopped serving it at the one church. And I said, Rod, how come you never told me? And he said, I don't want to share any macaroni and cheese with you. So, I mean, it was just a great guy. His funeral and service was yesterday. And just the testimonials that people gave and the caring that he had for people in the entire Buffalo community, he's going to be very, very sorely missed by his wife Mamie, also known as Deb, and also by his two children, Kimberly Trent and Todd Charos. Thank you, sir. Councilmember White. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to give condolences to the family of a high school classmate of mine at Seneca Vocational, Ronnie Neely. Really, really nice guy, suddenly passed. And also one of the latest murder victims, Geneva Mae Smith, who's 31 years old, who'll be funeralized at True Bethel. I wish I had a magic wand to stop these senseless murders. Young 31-year-old killed, leaves a daughter. And it's just senseless and I wish we had some plan to kind of address it, but it continues to plague our community, to plague our society, and we're just praying for that family. Council Member Scanlon. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask that we please keep in our thoughts and prayers the family of Joe Camizzi who passed away last week after a battle with cancer. Joe is the wife of Sue, the husband, his wife Sue, his son Michael and his late daughter Mariah. He also spent the past 35 years working at the Buffalo News. He had a wonderful family and friends there as well. And also please keep in our thoughts the family of Catherine Finnegan, who is affectionately known as Princess by her family and friends. She's the mother of eight, a long-time South Buffalo resident, and the mother of Rick Finnegan, who I know a lot of us know, who has been many years working at the Buffalo News. Thank you. And I echo for the homicide victim, one who was just buried a couple days ago, who left seven children, and she leaves eight. So our hearts even go out to these children who have found themselves suddenly without some of them, without either parent. And so we pause, and of course, we always remember our parents. service men and women and civilians who have given their life for the freedom of others across this world since our last meeting. We pause in these chambers for a moment of silence. Thank you. Before going to the agenda, we have a presentation by Councilmember Wyatt. Thank you so much. I have the distinct honor today to honor two young men, and I want them to come down, who have reached the level of people Bring your family and your leaders. This is a distinct honor when we seem to have in the city of Buffalo, in this area, a growing number of Eagle Scouts who continue to take on leadership roles in our community. And these two individuals... Winfrey Jr. It is my distinct honor for the Common Council to bestow upon you on this day and recognize these young men and your accomplishments in becoming Eagle Scouts. May you continue to make an impact in our community and our world. And I just want to say something additional for this. As I go through my master's program in organizational leadership, it is so critically important for us to encourage, support our young people and their leadership skills It's just something that we need more of today and less of the other things. When you have young men who are so dishonored, there are so many great men who have taken on this mantle and have risen to greater leadership in attacking our world. So I pray that you two will be the similar gentlemen who make a difference, not only to make your families proud, but to make the city of Buffalo. So on this day, we recognize Emmanuel and Ramon. Can we get a hand? And I also want to recognize the outstanding leadership for our local Boy Scout leadership. And one of the gentlemen right here, and I want him to come over and say a few words because, again, over the last several years, we've had, it turns out, a number of Eagle Scouts. And I just want you to speak because we want folks to know that scouting is very important. Yes. My name is James Morrell. I'm the leader for Group 139. We put through five Eagle Scouts in the last year. from 139. So let's give a round. These are our latest two and I'm really proud of these guys because they work really hard and it takes a lot to become an Eagle Scout. So thank you and thank you. And for Mr. Morrell to be able to lead that troop after he's on so many boards and in so many positions of leadership across this city is amazing in itself. So thank you. All righty. I believe that's all before the agenda, so we're going to be taking a couple of items, ladies and gentlemen, out of order. One so that we can get some families out to celebrate, I guess, if everything goes well. And then some people who are here for public hearing, we will also take yours out of order and so that we get the heavy lifting done in the beginning of the meeting. Motion to take items 1 and 29 out of order. Seconded by Councilmember Golomba. Item 1, appoint fire commissioner. This item is open. All right, the item is open and... Gentlemen, we have before us a nomination from the mayor for Mr. William Rinaldo. And normally we would send this to a committee. We're going to do it right now today because we need to ensure that our fire department has leadership, not that it has not had any. I want to be clear. However, we want to make sure there's somebody sitting in that office who's accountable to the people. And so I will allow for there to be any questions or comments from the council at this time. Councilmember Rivera. Mr. Chairman, normally as you mentioned, we do send it to committee, however, we have the candidate before us today and like to give him an opportunity to talk about Some his ideas for the department before any questions. All right allow that brief First of all, I'd like to congratulate Emmanuel and Ramon for their accomplishment I know what goes into that program themselves and their families should be very proud I don't know too many people stuff that didn't really store to Higher rank so nothing but the best for them. I First of all, thank you everyone for being here to share this day with me. I stand, rather sit here before you, humbled and proud to possibly be your next fire commissioner. The Buffalo Fire Department has a long and proud tradition of excellence, mostly due to the extraordinary efforts and sacrifice of those who came before us. And that is something I tell people at every opportunity, and it's something that I'll remind our membership on a daily basis. Mayor Brown, members of the Common Council, thank you for your trust, confidence, and courage to make this appointment. expedition fully aware of the challenges that lay ahead, and I pledge to be 100% committed to fulfilling my duties as party commissioner to the highest standard. Albert Einstein is quoted as saying, you have to color outside the lines once in a while if you want to create a masterpiece. That's the kind of creativity and inspiration myself and my team will draw on as we search for the way ahead, for laying strategy and overcoming challenges. To the community, I pledge that this organization will deliver the most effective and efficient services possible. incorporating best practices, current trends, and emerging technology to ensure that we remain one of the premier fire departments in the state, if not the country, now and well into the future. I pledge that public safety will remain in the forefront and will always be at the heart of any policy decisions, strategy, or direction this department will take in the coming year. To the members of the Fire Department, thank you in advance for your unwavering support. You are truly the tip of the spear. the men and women on the front lines in the trenches fighting every day to execute the organization's mission keeping this community safe and staying true to our motto that others may live it's because of you that people in our community can sleep well at night knowing that you stand ready and ever vigilant i pledge to both you and your families that i will do my utmost to provide you with the tools to succeed and return home safely at the end of every shift Last and certainly not least, to my friends and family, I thank you for your patience and unwavering support throughout my career, and particularly in this endeavor. Without your love and support, this day would never be possible. Thank you for all your sacrifices you made over these many years, from the missed birthdays and anniversaries to school plays and everything in between. I wish I could say I'll make it up to you, but you've already heard that a few hundred times. So instead, I'll just say something I don't say often enough. I love you and appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, sir. I don't know if the applause is for your speech or for your love for your family. Council members, and I know you've met with each council member, I believe, or all that you could get to. So, Council Member White. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I met with Mr. Ronaldo, Commissioner Ronaldo. The first moment I met him, I had the privilege of getting a couple of calls from people who ‚Äì heard that he may have been appointed and they spoke glowingly of him. And the words that they gave me kind of represented the resume that I saw, which was a military man who was highly decorated. So to me that spoke that this is gonna be a person that's gonna have integrity, and he's gonna put in controls and process that will make sure that the firefighters and firewomen who are part of the Buffalo Fire Department will be exemplary in their training, in their leadership, in providing safety, to this medicine to the city of Buffalo. So I look forward to his leadership in addressing a number of the issues. He was very straightforward in saying what he was going to do and what he's gonna put in place. He's aware of the challenges and I look forward to supporting him in addressing each and every one. Thank you. Thank you. Council Member Mungo. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I met Bill just a couple days ago, and I met him with our Majority Leader, David A. Rivera. And we had the privilege of sitting there just talking about various things. And one of the things I noticed about him right off the bat was he was a humble man. But when you look at his 28-page resume, you can see all of the accomplishments that he's been able to commit in his life. But have you ever heard the term, uh, term, quiet storm? I believe that this man is a quiet storm. And if you mess with him too bad, I think he can show you exactly how he got all those credentials and accolades on his resume. But I believe that he is a great person just by meeting him. Not few, not many people can make the sort of impression, the sort of short time that Bill has. And I'm, I'm happy with his selection. I think it was just through osmosis. that him and the individual who brought him to the forefront met. I think it was just something that happened organically, and I'm just happy that he's here, and I'm pretty sure he's going to do a phenomenal job. And I'm glad that he's going to be able to put Commissioner on that long list of things and accomplishments that he's done in the city of Buffalo and other areas, serving our country and serving our city all of those years. And then when you look at him, you can't tell he has over 70 years of experience. i wanted to make sure i pointed that out i don't know which one is his brother his father but um he has seven years of experience and we think that he's going to be a great addition and we're just happy to have him thank you mr chair thank you sir customer president Thank you, Mr. President. I'm glad that there will be a new tiller at the helm of the fire department, which is desperately in need of leadership at this point. And probably one of the happiest people in City Hall has got to be Kevin Helfrich, because he had to do two jobs. He had to be parking commissioner and also very difficult to try to manage the fire department, which we need to talk to Mr. Rinaldo in my office about dealing with the overtime question. dealing with filling some of the leadership posts to be, to make the fire department to be back on a direction that's so necessary as one of the most, the second, you know, uniformed personnel in the city that are so critical to life, property and safety. We had an excellent conversation. I asked him, what was your most difficult moment as a firefighter? And that was going back in the early days because he started in 1982. Around that time there was that terrible propane explosion that occurred in the southern part of my district. A number of firefighters were killed and it was just a real shock to the entire city and the community. So he remembers that very, very well. So he's got that sensitivity, he's got the experience and knowledge. I think as Mr. Lingo alluded, he's no showboater. And also I looked at his resume, he's got a military background, but he also teaches or taught in military science. So he talked about, Mr. Golombek would appreciate this, some of the great battles in world history. I know you love that. Influence him, so we had a nice conversation on that sidebar as well. So he's a well-rounded individual who also served his country, and so I will enthusiastically vote for Mr. Rinaldo. Thank you. Once you talk to Councilmember Franczak about history, you were in, you had history. It was over. Anything else, Councilmember Rivera? Councilmember Rivera? Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Certainly our thoughts are with the former commissioner who was with us, who has since resigned from his position. We discussed the challenges. During our committee meetings for any commissioner that's coming on challenges with overtime with staffing civilian firemen attrition and it was very difficult to find a candidate and I think Heaven health for looking deep and I thought it was a great idea when they came back and they found somebody with his qualifications He has come up through the ranks in the book in the Buffalo Fire Department retired Certainly, he has, I think that gives him a little bit of freedom. He is not concerned about any issues. He's retired. He's not coming back into the department when he leaves here. So he doesn't have to worry about the decisions he makes. They're independent decisions. And I like that idea. Certainly, he has to surround himself with people. I don't want to see him burned out like the other commissioners that left before him. It is a very difficult job, it's very demanding, and we have seen a turnover in the fire department over the years. And the expectancy of a commissioner in the fire department has been very, very short. And hopefully, and we asked that question when he was in office, how long do you expect to be here? And he says, as long as the mayor wants me here. So he's going to be here for a while. I commend you. I assume the men and women of the fire department have much respect for you. We're looking forward to working with you and to dealing with the things that come before the Common Council. There was an audit that was before this Common Council that's still outstanding that the previous deputy commissioner was working on, and that's something that's still before this Common Council. We wish you all the best. We congratulate you, and certainly your family that's here with you today are very proud You married. Thank you very much. Thank you, Governor. All right. Now, I know our speeches are longer than probably your tenure will be. I know we take it like five years. But I do want to say this, that I did the same thing. I had all these text messages. I think I even showed you one from people saying, hey, if this is the guy, he's the guy. And it was from your firefighters. That's important. One of them even promoted you because they said... He's a general. And when I told you that, you said, no, I was a colonel. So they're already promoting you. We hear anything else, council members? All right, motion. Motion is to approve. All right, motion to approve, second by the president pro temp, Christopher P. Scanlon. And it is unanimous. And so I would like to welcome to the floor the newest fire commissioner. I got a word upstairs that you are Latino. Uh, no. No, I'm not. Oh, sorry. So you got one up there you need to demote then, because he made you not only a general but Latino, and I was gonna do this whole thing in Spanish. Okay, thank you. You raise your right hand, and repeating these words, I, William Rinaldo, do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York, and I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of the fire department commissioner of the city of Buffalo, according to the best of my ability. Commissioner Welk. It is official. Buffalo has a fire commissioner. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Commissioner. All right. We'll let all the press. I know they just want to stay for the whole meeting and enjoy themselves. Yeah, I'm just going to let everybody get out. All right.

I agree that a guy next to my house right now hasn't cut his grass about the house at auction brought the house at auction and Called him other days in New York So when you go cut the grass, he says he didn't know. Somebody asked me whether I'm going to cut the grass. I said I'll choke on the chicken bone first. He needs to cut his grass. So I'm not paying him. Another grown man's voice comes remember Scanlon. Thank you. Could we revisit item number 29 in legislation item number 29? You want to revisit? Yes, please motion to revisit item 29 second by councilmember why thank you at first I want to apologize I was Speaking about another issue with councilmember glum back when this came up earlier and then you called on me to make sure I was Ready to approve and I thought I was being called out for speaking like I was back in grade school but um this This item is a renaming of the bridge in Cazenovia Park on the golf course after Patrick P.J. McParland, who's just a wonderful man who spent four decades working for both the City of Buffalo and the Olmstead Parks Conservancy, maintaining Cazenovia Park, and in particular its golf course, and just doing an incredible job at it. In addition to that, he... Couldn't begin to tell you how many summer youth workers he supervised over the decades He was in that park and I was one of them and so he was able to tolerate me for a couple of summers He he deserves an honor like this So I'm thankful to the Olmstead parks Conservancy for beginning this and I think my colleagues were voting in favor Of this great honor for mr. McFarland. Thank you, sir. All right gentlemen coming before you now the comparable cities I'll bring one up to the chair in just a second. I did quickly review it. Someone was here from the department. I'm going down just in case there's a question. Normally we wouldn't do this, but we're coming toward recess, and I want to get as much done before so we don't have to have any special meetings. So if you see it, and I would like to make sure this gets filed so that the public can see this. I think that's important. So I like to get this stuff in early so the public nothing, I don't want anything hidden from the public. As you see Dallas, Texas per poll, and this was a question of, the question was how much are other municipalities charging for the small cell to be placed on top of the polls. Houston, Texas 2,000 to 2,700. San Antonio 1,500. Island Park 2,400. Milwaukee 1,800. Boston 2,500. San Diego, 4,000. Glendale, Arizona, 3,400. And Scottsdale, Arizona, 3,600. Then there is a state college park at 400 to 500. Any questions, gentlemen, council members? Council Member Rivera? Thank you very much, President. I'm looking at the term of the agreement. Some are 25 years, some are five, three. What are our terms? The ones that's in front of us? What's the terms? Three years. Three years. So they would have to renew after three years and pay the fee over again? They do have to renew after three years. Every one year you pay the fee. So they pay this fee every year? Every year. Come on now. I apologize. This is the team that actually worked on it. Okay. I'm just the pretty face. Okay. You've got to state your name. And we're in deep trouble. That's right. Yeah, and when you come down, just state your name for the record, what department or whoever you're working for. My name is Caitlin Collins, and I'm here representing mobility. It looks like there's an annual fee per attachment, $500, and a $2,000 fee for... is not included. Oh, I think that's also annual, and that's for attachments and non-city owned. Move that mic right in front of you so we can make sure, say that again? 2000 and city owned. Okay. You're losing me. Just, I want to know exactly just look in the contract if you can and give me exact numbers. Okay. Franchisees would be required to pay the city an annual fee per small cell attachment system to city facilities in the right of way in the amount of $2,000. Subject to annual increases outlined in Chapter 175, Fees of the City Code. Okay, is that clear to everybody? Did everybody get that? Okay, so it is the annual fee of $2,000. All right. Council Member Fontana? To the Speaker, if the company, if somebody was here two weeks ago or a week ago and said we were way off base, where do we get the number from? And do you think as a result of us receiving this spreadsheet that we're kind of on par with other cities of like size and nature? So that's a tough one, counsel. Just state your name. Adam Walters, Philip Seidel, representing Mobility. I will tell you that for New York, upstate cities, that's a pretty high number. And at least some of the carriers I know were here at the Legislation Committee expressing that they felt that number was out of line. I can only tell you from Mobility's perspective, we're comfortable and we're ready to move forward and we want to move forward. What's Mobility? Mobility is a tower company, if you will. They build. infrastructure for national carriers and they do have a contract with the national carrier for a build-out in Buffalo say again who pays who pays us them or you Oh mobility pays the fee they do and you're comfortable with it they are comfortable with it and they are here today to say they would very much like you to move forward I think that's I mean an industry expert is here that builds the towers and pays the bill they're comfortable with it council members any other questions All right, I'm not going to do a whole public hearing on this. We've already been to committee. You know, I wanted to make sure these numbers are what we asked for, but we're not going to start from scratch. So thanks for being here. But we, unless council members have another question. Council Member Franczak. So it looks like the annual attachment rent, Buffalo's like middle of the pack. Yes. Because you have a high of 4,000 in San Diego, like you said. 400. 400, right. So we're kind of the middle of the range here. Yeah, exactly. So, Council Member Ferver? Mr. Chairman, when you asked for comparables, I was thinking comparables in a sense of cities, the size of the city of Buffalo in terms of population. comparing us to San Diego is, I don't know the population in San Diego, it's probably more than a million. We're worth 267,000 people. So when we ask for comparables, let's compare oranges to oranges and apples to apples. Going forward, at least when you ask for comparables, give us some comparables that... Maybe we better be a little bit more... descriptive of what what we want but at this point I asked for it and you know I'm satisfied we have a million people in the county we have a million people in the county yeah exactly and I think we're ready for a vote but do you have something significant sir to add to and then I want to move on and vote it up or down sorry Robert McDowell budget director we've done a few of these in my previous occupations at being a CFO of different food district and most of these fees are in the $2,000 to $4,000 range. Only caveat I would ask is that usually it's a five-year term instead of a three but the dollar value is in the range that I've seen before and I think it's appropriate. Apples to apples. Mike? Unless you got something brand new to tell us. You got anything? The only reason I'm pushing this is because I want to get as much out of the door as possible before August. So we're not, and I definitely don't want the city to lose a nickel of revenue. Council Member Watt. I just wanted, since we had a budget director, what are we looking at, Mr. Budget Director, as far as annual income to the city? He didn't, did you hear him? He's asking you, budget director. Mr. Budget director. He missed it. My friend was talking to him. Sorry about that. What are we looking at as far as annual income to the city? I have not seen the contract. I'm sorry. I will definitely look at it and confer with Mike, and we'll get back to you. That's a good question, because that wasn't in the budget. No, we need to know. I mean, because I know that they talked about the number of polls, but at least to have to know that number because, you know, if we're looking at a three-year contract, which I think is okay to start, I wouldn't want to go long-term because I don't know if tomorrow or next year the price will start increasing and we'll be sliding to a five-year contract as opposed to renegotiating after three years. The revenue that we've ‚Äì Restate your name, sir. Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. Michael Finn, the city engineer. Okay. THE REVENUE THAT PUBLIC WORK PROJECTS AS PART OF THIS UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR IS APPROXIMATELY $125,000. NEW SPEAKER Okay. NEW SPEAKER Okay. NEW SPEAKER So not a million. NEW SPEAKER I was hoping it was a million. NEW SPEAKER How many polls is that? How many polls are we talking about generally? NEW SPEAKER When I was in third grade, they handed me a calculator and I could not do math in my head. NEW SPEAKER He said he's an engineer. NEW SPEAKER Give me one second, though. NEW SPEAKER I'm sorry. NEW SPEAKER I'm sorry. NEW SPEAKER I'm sorry. NEW SPEAKER I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. McDowell. Is that all? And that's a conservative estimate. There are carriers who are talking to us about 75 off the bat. So we looked at it from a conservative standpoint. We'd all like to see more. I think the carriers would as well. Hopefully we'll exceed that. Thank you. All right. All right. It's in your committee. No objections. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Just one quick question for Mr. Finn. Mr. Finn, these are wood poles only. They're not going to put these on decorative light poles like on Porter Avenue or Clinton Street or Lovejoy Street, correct? The. The fee that's set up is $2,000 for attachment to city poles. Right. For attachment to wood poles, there's a lesser fee because those are all owned by National Grid. But is there a possibility you're going to go on Richmond Avenue and put something on a pole that Dave Rivera put up or a pole that I put up on Lovejoy Street? There is a public review process for all of the locations that are to be submitted where the public and council members can have input on where these are located. And many of the carriers who we've discussed with have, giving us assurances that they're not interested in having these in locations that are highly visible when they can move a block over and still get the same service. So it'll be a back-and-forth through the permitting process. We'll be able to try and make everybody happy. Thank you. All righty. Councilmember? Councilmember Wingo. It may be a very, very, very weird question, but being that all these things are going up all over the place, I'm concerned about radiation or what type of... Waves these things are emitting that could potentially affect or harm or hurt the constituents and the residents in the community You know, I was always cognizant of the fact that when you come to the city All of our wires are all exposed in front of the houses But then you go out to the suburbs and higher-end areas and all the poles are hidden And here we are talking about putting up all these cell towers. I'm curious as to have you done any type of research that would inform us as to how much Radiation or waves that these things are emitting into the community being that they're coming up all over the place now. Oh, yeah, so may I just answer? I don't know if that's is that for the city engineer? Is this who works for us? I want to get from the city engineer. I can answer briefly the FCC federal communication commission. oversee the health and safety of all the equipment and certify to it. They actually prohibit local law from superseding that because they put so much effort into it. Her specifications are required that everything that's installed is FCC certified so that we have that backing from a public health perspective that the federal government is doing their due diligence to oversee the equipment. So the equipment is being installed and it's within FCC guidelines, but do we still know some folks are more susceptible to cancer than others? Maybe those levels in certain areas now that they're installing those towers May be a little bit more than those folks would like to be exposed to It's just I think I would that would be good for us to know exactly how much they're emitting Yeah I would I would want to know They're installing a tower on the corner of my house my street or back my house or whatever the case is I'd like to know so I'm just want to know I just want to know if we're going to publish that information even though it's within the FCC guidelines or or regulations, I still want to know. We can easily handle that as part of the application process. All righty. So item number 30, my motion, out of legislation, my motion is to approve. All right, motion approved, seconded by Council Member Fairlittle. Talking real fast now. Thank you. Announcement of committee meetings. Regular committees.
