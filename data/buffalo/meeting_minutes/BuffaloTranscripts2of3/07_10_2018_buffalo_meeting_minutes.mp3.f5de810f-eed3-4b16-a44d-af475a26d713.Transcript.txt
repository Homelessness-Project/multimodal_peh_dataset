Council District. We pray no one left behind, that the water as it rises will lift up every ship, every neighborhood, every zip code, every block of our precious district. Bless now those, your servants, as they deliberate today. Let your presence be obvious, we pray in Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Thank you, chaplain. Councilmember, is there a memorial? Councilmember White? I'm praying for the Munson family. Tanika, who was a former clerk in the clerk's, former employee of the clerk's office, her mom and her dad and her stepmom were the ones who were killed in Atlanta. And it's just a tough time. So we pray for that family as well as the other families, Yvette. And just the senseless murders that have been happening in our community, we pray for all the families. We pray for our city. Thank you. CUNCILLEUR FONTANA. NEW YORK STATE TROOPER NICHOLAS CLARK, 29 YEARS OLD, SHOT, RESPONDING TO A CALL, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALL, VERY, VERY TROUBLING CALL, MOST DANGEROUS CALLS OFFICERS HAVE TO ENDURE. THIS WAS A 29-YEAR-OLD STATE TROOPER, VERY TALENTED, VERY MUCH DEVOTED TO HIS STATE AND SHOT IN A SITUATION THAT STATE TROOPERS ARE CALLED INTO EVERY DAY. SO OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS FOR HIS FAMILY. Thank you, Mr. President. Dorothy Kristic, the lovely wife of Charlie Kristic, passed away last week, jokingly referred to as the first lady of the Croatian club up in North Buffalo before we purchased it when it actually was a Croatian ethnic club. She's going to be very, very sorely missed by her family and friends. Richard Snickles passed away, senior citizen extraordinaire. He was a volunteer van driver at Northwest Buffalo Community Center. He's going to be very, very sorely missed by his family. And he was sort of the embodiment of so many people that all of us have in our district. He volunteered. The old people, he was in his 80s, the old people needed a ride to Northwest Buffalo Community Center, so he volunteered to drive the van so that he could help out the old people. And you know I was shocked actually when he passed away because I never thought of him as being that old former All Saints teacher and Riverside resident Cora Wilkinson Passed away. She's going to be very very sorely missed by her family and her friends And last but certainly not least Glenn Volker from Black Rock as in Volker bowling lanes Black Rock tradition over in Elmwood and Amherst streets. Glenn is going to be very, very sorely missed by his family and friends. I got to work with him on a couple of projects in the neighborhood. He was just a good guy. He was just a good, solid, salt-of-the-earth kind of a fellow, but I hope to remember them in our thoughts and prayers. Councilman Scandler. Thank you. I'd ask that we please keep in our thoughts longtime South Buffalo resident Collette Carey, who passed away, who's going to be greatly missed by her four children and dozen grandchildren, and also keep in our thoughts and prayers Mrs. Linda Donovan, who's the wife of former Police Commissioner Richard Donovan, who passed away last week, and she's going to be sorely missed by her sons, Timothy and Brian, daughter Colleen, and her grandchildren, who are the absolute love of her life. So I ask that we keep the two of them in our thoughts. I'm a former sheriff, and I believe I read Higgins also who passed. And Councilmember White mentioned the family of Yvette Johnson and baby Kyrie who were funeralized yesterday. My days are all mixed up, but who were funeralized on yesterday and then Carrie and Deborah Hubbard, who we will funeralize on Saturday, probably the fourth time in 24 years of pastoring, of having double funerals, and both of the others, all of the others were all homicides. And so we are praying much for those families, and of course all of the men and women who have given their life for the freedom of our country since we have last met. We pause in these chambers for a moment of silence. Thank you. There is a special presentation by University District Councilmember Rasheed N.C. Wyatt. You didn't want to come down? This is a special day and there's big things in a university. A couple of council meetings ago we had two young men who were acknowledged as equal scouts. Another great event, Food Market, which many of you know was a very small cart, expanded a big way, about four million dollars, excuse me, four million dollars on that corner. And they could have went anywhere. They could have found some space in the Elmwood Village, or wherever, but they chose to stay in the University District. And because of their investment and the state-of-the-art equipment in their school, it's not just a little mom and pop anymore, it's state-of-the-art. And they've hired 45 employees, so I want to thank them in this recognition for, to recognize Samir, Celine, and Abdullah Ahmed, Imperial Market, located at 32. BAILEY AVENUE IN BUFFALO, BUT THE MARKET EXPENSION WAS CREATED 45,000 BAILEY CUSTOM NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE UNIVERSITY ADDITION. THEY ARE NO STRANGERS TO THIS COMMUNITY, AND I APPRECIATE THEIR INVESTMENT AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH THE COMMUNITY. I KNOW I'VE STRUGGLED BY THEM NUMEROUS TIMES, AND I SEE THE LOTS FILLED WITH ACTIVITY, SO I THANK THEM FOR THE ACTIVITY AND THEIR INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITY. MR. WHITE, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME OVER HERE. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW I'VE BEEN IN THAT COMMUNITY SINCE 1992. I START AT THE STORE. MY DEAN IS TO PROVE OUR CITIZENSHIP AND FINALLY HAVE FRIENDS FOR TODAY. ALL RIGHT. YOU MUST HAVE A VERY NICE STORE. COUNCILMEMBER WIDE WILL GIVE YOU AN AWARD AND A FREE COMMERCIAL. We also have one other today. I think they were going to make it national holiday, the David Afranczak holiday because it's his birthday today. So happy birthday, Councilmember. 39 years old. All right. Mr. President, I wish Damone Smith was here because he used to be able to sing in Polish. Happy birthday. Oh, that is â€“ he did do it one year. He did. Yes, he did. Yeah. Anybody in the Chamber know how to sing in Polish? All right. No? All right. Well, that's an acquired... That takes a lot of skill. Yeah. Thank you. We are going to take item out of order for a public hearing. Oh, I'm sorry. Nope, I got to get this in order. On a motion by Mr. Revere, seconded by Ms. Scanlon, the minutes of the stated meeting held on June 12th are approved. Are there any late files I report? Are there any objections to the late files? Hearing no objections to the late files, we will hear the entire agenda. That is before it's not taken away your right to pause the meeting if you did not receive any of the late files. Do we have any late files? We don't have any last minute ones. Great. All right, I think we are rolling along. Mr. President, motion to take 88 out of order. Second by Council Member Fierletto.

Motion to open a public hearing. Second by Councilmember Wyatt. Public hearing is now open. Is there anyone here to speak on this item? All right. For the record, I will state that we have worked with Ellicott Development that actually bought All of the houses on Saint Paul and has waited for over 2 years now in this as we had a moratorium and I've always said I've been very open that they should receive this property and even the abandonment of the small street there. They treated the residents there very, very well in the cell of those properties and the project around it is a. asset they even saved the church there that I believe other developers may have knocked down and they are really beautifully restoring it so I support this wholeheartedly no other comments Mr. Chairman motion to close public hearing second by council member, Columbia Motion to approve motion to approve second by council member chairman If you would just give me a minute correct my agenda because I have absolutely gender which is different than the agenda that everybody else has You can sir.

I'm 50 secondhand dealer 207 Niagara motion to approve items 50 through 53 second by council member Lingo as a floor yeah, can we go back to revisit 35? I? Motion to revisit item 35? Yeah, before we get to 5. Motion to revisit item 35. Seconded by Councilmember Freeler. Item is before us. We approved this item, and I don't recall this going to finance. Did this go through finance? It doesn't have to go to finance. How many? So 20 vehicles. Do we know how much we're going to pay for these 20 vehicles? We just approved it for them to... It was discussed in caucus. I mean, nobody asked for it to be sent. So it doesn't have to, for clarification, it doesn't automatically have to be, no item has to automatically be sent like this to finance. If there was a question or a council member had a question, we had the staff there to answer it, so we didn't. Okay. We just approved it. So we don't know how much we're paying for these vehicles? You said we don't know who's paying for them? Yeah, we don't know how much we're paying for these vehicles. Does anybody know how much we're paying for these vehicles? No. We're buying 20 vehicles, 10 marked, 10 unmarked. Yeah, it says up to 10 marked vehicles from the 2018-2019 fiscal budget. Council Member Fontana. What was the motion? It was going to look like finance. Approved. No, it was to approve. Okay. Sometimes we send this to finance to ask what type of vehicles, but at this point, we're unhappy with the price and the performance of the Tahos, so they're going to continue to buy the... the Dodge Chargers at this point, the all-wheel drive Chargers. Now, those are sucking gas down faster than Mickey Kearns at a beer station, but it's just not going to be, there's no other choice out there at this point. All right, so we can basically anticipate how much we're going to pay for them just because of what we've already purchased. All right. Well, it's off the state bid. The Chargers are the least expensive patrol vehicle out there at this point. The Tahos, they raised upwards of $40,000, and the 14 Tahos are breaking down left and right. There's no air conditioners in some of them, so the 15s got better. When I speak to the police, they do like the Chargers. They prefer Durangos at this point, but we're not going to shell out that kind of money for Durangos. I'll say it's it's you know if you want to send it to finance We could have them come in and discuss to see how they've been doing We are using quite a bit more gas in these cars, but in today's world of unibody cars There's not much out there on the market that really holds up the police work. Yeah. No, that's it I mean, there's only car out there so So, I mean, you're buying 10 unmarked as well. Just 10 marked. That's not a lot of cars. The question is, is that all we're buying for the year? Because if it's only 10, that's going to put us behind in future years because we normally have to buy at least 25 for a year. There might be another source of funds coming, so that's the question. They might be buying more cars. 10 would not be enough for the fiscal year. Yes, that was my other follow-up question. The 10 unmarked cars, are these going to captains or chiefs? Yes. Those are the cars that you'll see driving around. They do take those home. It's one of those maintenance of effort situations. Sometimes they're called in the middle of the night so they have a car with them. They should not be taking them to Florida. They should not be taking them shopping, I don't think, but they should have them ready to go if they have to come into work. All right motion stands On a 54 use card dealer 337 North Adgan motion sent alleged second by councilman Fontana on 55 a point environmental safety assistant motion attendance in the civil service items 55 and 56 and my customer content 57 permission to waive formal bidding A motion was to send to finance, but we did get some clarification, and I think Councilmember Fontana would like to speak on that. Councilmember Fontana has the floor. I appreciate that. Thank you. I did receive a call from Bill Sutherland. Some people think he's my brother, but he's not. But Bill wanted to tell me about the item. I thought he reached out to leadership, so I apologize. I didn't call up anybody on it. He did call me and ask that we approve that this week. He was unable to get formal bids, but he went out and received four informal bids for the work. It's for police headquarters, and it will save us time to get into the building, and that's what we all wanted to do over the budget cycle is get into police headquarters. So this would save us time if we approve it today. I'm confident that he took informal bids properly and that they represented to us today properly, and we do have four relatively close bids here. Here, one being the lowest, and that's the one he picked to choose. All right. So I'm okay with a motion to approve at this point, if my colleagues are. Otherwise, if they're not, I'll entertain it in finance. But I did formally vet the item. All right. Motion to approve. Second by Council Member Fontana. Thank you.
