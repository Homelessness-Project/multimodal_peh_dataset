 Item 1, call for special session pursuant to Section 3.9 of the Charter of the City of Buffalo upon the written request of six council members. Dated June 20, 2017. Presented to you herewith, I hereby call a special meeting of the Common Council to be held in the Council Chamber City Hall of Buffalo, New York, and waive the 24-hour notice on June 20, 2017 at 1.55 p.m. for the following purpose. To receive and take appropriate action on the home rule request Senate Bill S4427A, Michigan Avenue, Archway.
 Motion to receive and file. Second by Councilmember Golombet. Item number two, HR Senate Bill S4427A, Michigan Avenue, Archway. Motion to adopt. Motion to adopt and just before we take the second, we'll have Corporation Council explain why we had to have this special meeting so that public understands why. Lauren Howard, Assistant Corporation Council. The Council previously adopted Home Rule messages
 that were sent to the Senate and Assembly for the Michigan Street Archway to have the bonds released. The home rule message to the Assembly was received in Albany, but the home rule message to the Senate seemed to have been lost in translation along the way, so we're redoing it today. So nothing has changed on the project? No. It's just everything is the same, and this is for the funding of the project for the bonds? Yes. For the record, Council Member Wingo has taken a seat in the chambers for the meeting.
 All right. Any questions, Council Members? Then it will be seconded by Council Member Wyatt. Next item. Motion to adjourn. Seconded by Council Member Lingo.
