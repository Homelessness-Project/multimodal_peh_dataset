11_16_2021,affordable housing,This is [ORGANIZATION] at [TIME] At the delegate right. So I'm hoping that everyone who's watching will attend because this is a major development that will bring more affordable housing here to the city of [ORGANIZATION] and we really would like everyone's input. We have been in communication with the developers and they seem to be very very excited and knowledgeable at the same time about what they're trying to do here.
11_29_2016,affordable housing,"Now, some would say that's a bad problem. I say it's a part of a growing city, but government still should look, I believe, at how and what tools do we have in order to either incentivize businesses  rent stabilization in some [STREET], encourage it, continue. We know that the administration has been pushing affordable housing."
11_29_2016,affordable housing,um but we also want to make sure we have some professionals if you know of who might may really help us I in this task force and move for council member why thank you share wanna thank you for your leadership on this I think it's something that's very timely and very important matter fact I'm gonna be having a meeting with a group of folks  who worked with [ORGANIZATION] regarding inclusionary zoning as well as affordable housing. I think that people want to see their elected officials doing something about their plight. And many of them are in situations that they can't help themselves.
11_29_2016,affordable housing,They should be able to benefit too. So I think this is a timely task force. I'm looking forward to working with the individuals that come with some new ideas to help balance this thing out because we do want developers to come and develop affordable housing and make sure that everyone benefits.
11_29_2016,affordable housing,"They all include workforce housing or affordable housing. And one of my greatest concerns has been all of the new development that was coming downtown, much of it was market rate. And so you would not have that inclusion and that diversity."
11_29_2016,affordable housing,There is money to be made. There is a niche with affordable housing. There's a niche with market rate.

People get evicted, people lose their jobs, and we have safe havens in the community who make sure that them and their families are taken care of."

She has championed efforts to make...

You know, but we do it with love and compassion, and we're there to serve the community. We're actually trying to build a second shelter because family homelessness is really escalating right now, and there's not enough space and shelter to house families."

Their mission is to provide runaway homeless and [STREET] youth with safe shelter and services in an environment that supports dignity, respect, and self-reliance.

09_15_2020,affordable housing,"Thank you Mr. [PERSON]. and of course uh [ORGANIZATION] if it wasn't for [ORGANIZATION] a lot of people would not have affordable housing and it wouldn't be generated within our community um because [ORGANIZATION] works very hard with community groups so we're praying for her hearing another we continue to remember um  the men and women who may have given their life for the freedom of our country and others since our last meeting, and all of the names that have been called, we pause for a moment of silence. Thank you."
12_12_2023,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] has demonstrated unwavering dedication to supporting families experiencing homelessness, which we know is a big problem in our city. I remember meeting with one of the foundations about the tremendous amount of homelessness we have. And someone said to me, well I don't see them under the bridges."
12_12_2023,homeless; homelessness,"because they did not understand that homelessness is not only about people under bridges, but those who have to move back home, those who are couch surfing, those who are in shelters, and your organization has been on the forefront. And this just briefly says in collaboration with partners, [ORGANIZATION] seeks to create a community that envelops, homeless children and their families in hope. That they are committed to a personal and family focused approach, recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of every single individual."

Thank you for what you do and all of your staff does for all of us in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. My gosh, wow."
12_12_2023,homelessness,"And you go to work and you put your head down and you sweat and you bleed and you cry and you just try to get families home again. Family homelessness is about 35% of homelessness all over the [STREET]. And right now we don't have enough shelters and so your support, your recognition is so important for us to be able to continue the work that we do and to get the message across."
11_14_2023,affordable housing,"Miscellaneous item number 66, affordable housing task force [ORGANIZATION] report. Motion to send to legislation. [ORGANIZATION] legislation seconded by ORG1 Member [PERSON]."
11_14_2023,affordable housing,"On this item, and just so the public knows, this is a rather detailed, well at least the first report of [ORGANIZATION]. If you haven't had a chance to look at it, it is full of ideas to help with affordable housing and to help with the rising costs legislatively, which is very important. This committee that is made up of community members, made up of activists, made up of residents, is working very hard."
11_14_2023,affordable housing,"That [STREET] some things that corporation council needs to look at, other things our state legislature might need to look at, can stay on the table as long as you all who will be. at least still here, will be able to look at and take down the [STREET]. We have heard from our residents for [ORGANIZATION], at least [ORGANIZATION], about the problem with affordable housing."
11_14_2023,affordable housing,"And I want to thank this council for supporting [ORGANIZATION]. We'll hear the complaints, but we probably won't hear all of the, at least something, something is being done more than talk. but real legislation."
11_14_2023,affordable housing,"I got a chance to look through it, and exactly what you said is great recommendations. And some of the things that we have said as council members as far as increasing fees and fines using the rental registry great recommendation so again i commend that committee what they brought forth and look forward to working with [ORGANIZATION] and making those things a reality because some of it is common sense and it's it is great that some independent folks brought it forth people who are from the community in hopes that we can get this done because we know that affordable housing is a challenge good affordable housing is a challenge"
11_01_2016,affordable housing,"And the more I think about this, how important this is to have inclusionary zoning where when you're building residents, residential units to make sure that people can afford, at least a portion of them should be some affordable housing. Because I think what we're doing, what we hear right now is in certain areas you have subsidized housing and you have a lot of that. You know, we do a lot of ribbon cutting for housing that is for low income in certain areas."
10_15_2024,affordable housing,"where he led major projects that improve city parks, playgrounds, and public spaces. In his role as project manager for [ORGANIZATION], Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] transformative housing projects such as [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION], creating affordable housing and revitalizing [ORGANIZATION] communities.

But for the [PERSON], this is significant in that an area that is experiencing gentrification will now have, see the first land trust in our known history where there will be affordable housing there."
10_02_2018,affordable housing,"I 100% am in for not only these lots, but hopefully when this land trust gets rolling, There will be more lots in an area so that you can have market rate housing and affordable housing and work class housing and doctors walk into the medical campus. Also with the custodian maybe living next door, children going to school together. This is what we talk about when we talk about One Buffalo."
10_17_2023,affordable housing,"For the following condition following the completion of all phases of development There shall be no fewer than 616 units of affordable housing on the site currently known as 90 and 100 FAC0. I Thank you, sir. For the record."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"Go ahead, sit down. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm here as a developer currently working on FAC0. I support the need for affordable housing, and I understand the need for affordable housing, particularly in the east side."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"We just have a suggestion because for the affordable housing to actually be built, it also needs to be affordable on the builder's side as well. All I'm going to suggest is that, and we've brought examples here, by the [STREET], of affordable housing that is family-oriented with multiple bedrooms that we can build that would actually fall below the standards that have been suggested in terms of square footage, minimum lot size, depth, et cetera. So all we're suggesting is to set aside the mathematical limitations  interpretation of what affordable housing is from a proportion and allow it to be built, allow the developers and the builders to create it."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"at FAC0 and FAC1 simply because it reminds us of the type of character and of the mixture of the neighborhood that we are. There is a lot of affordable housing in [LOCATION] and a lot of it could be torn down if the present plans that we see that have been proposed by both [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], they want to tear down affordable housing. We support affordable housing."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] supports affordable housing. We think there should be a separate ordinance passed by this good body that defines what affordable housing is throughout the city, including FAC0. We would ask though that that be a separate issue, maybe a resolution passed by the council saying within [ORGANIZATION] we will have inclusionary, we will determine what affordable housing is and how it should be done."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,There's talks about providing affordable housing and prevention of demolition. The thing about a zoning code is that it can't be a brush to fix all issues. I urge that the council adopts  plan that speaks to the heart of what it was envisioned.
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION] at ORG0. We are, among many other things, an affordable housing developer."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"So we see [ORGANIZATION] the crisis of affordable housing in this city. Our waiting list for the affordable apartments we develop at this point is close to 400 households. And [ORGANIZATION] people are coming in, filling out applications, wondering what their status is, and telling stories about their being displaced from their neighborhoods."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"So we strongly support inclusionary zoning within the Green Code, and we hope that the final version of the Green Code includes an inclusionary zoning provision. Just to give you an example, the median income of a renter in [ORGANIZATION] is around $22,000. So if you use the standard affordable housing definition of paying no more than 30% of your income in rent, that's a rent of around $600."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"The new development that we're seeing across [ORGANIZATION], and we're in support of new development, but much of that new development is luxury housing with rents of $1,200, $1,800, $2,500. That is not affordable to the vast majority of this city, and in addition, that new development  leads to increases of rents and home prices in the surrounding area, again, furthering displacement and lack of affordable housing in this city. So inclusionary zoning directly goes to mitigating the impact of new development, and we hope it is included in the Green Code so that the new [ORGANIZATION] is an equitable city and provides opportunities for all of us who live here."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,I also support inclusionary zoning. I think we need to be creative in order to ensure that there's affordable housing in our city. I don't think this is appropriate probably for the Green Code.
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"Secondly, affordable housing. I think [ORGANIZATION] has a chance, and I don't know how this relates to the Green Code, but to get away from a city in which people, because they don't have enough money, are constantly pushed from one area to another, you know, into [ORGANIZATION] because people are moving out of [ORGANIZATION] into [PERSON] and then back into the suburbs because now people are moving into [ORGANIZATION]. We need to get away from that."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"What are we going to do about making more affordable housing? She was crying literally that she had nowhere to go with five kids. We need to step up and actually build more affordable housing, inclusionary zoning, so that people can actually have a [STREET] to live that is actually nice."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] can't create the amount of affordable housing that we need. We actually are trying with ORG1 doing solar panels and trying to invest into our city. But this should be happening throughout the whole entire city.
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"And there needs to be more affordable housing. That 30% should be mandatory if anybody develops. PERSON0, [PERSON]."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"I think our city government has a great opportunity to make a very progressive move in adding inclusionary zoning to the green code. What it will do is secure affordable housing for the people who live in this city. I want to give a shout out to my council person, [ORGANIZATION], who has taken the information that we've provided  and has seriously considered how this could benefit our community."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"It's green only in the sense that it addresses density and walkability, but even there, state-funded, developer-driven density without affordable housing is the exact same thing as the builder and car-centric driven density. suburban development that our planners demonized [ORGANIZATION]. So what's the difference?"
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"But since we are not [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] or [ORGANIZATION], we don't have to think about or worry about that yet. Further, when asked if he could name a fair price for affordable housing in the city, he didn't have an answer. Secondly, I'd like to, in a meeting in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] made a statement that during [ORGANIZATION] we saw some of the most vibrant communities in American history."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"And also, are they building these developments that would include affordable housing? Okay, that's another thing that we got to look at and we're saying in the community should be about 30% of The residents there should be low income residents. Okay."
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"First of all, I have worked for [ORGANIZATION]. I was a fellow for [ORGANIZATION], and I have a startup whose application to the ORG2 is pending in order to provide affordable housing. I'd just like to make one thing clear."
10_31_2023,affordable housing,So what we have here and and the question that was asked to me at a community meeting was this is a residential neighborhood Where are the residents? so we know that through [ORGANIZATION] who has an application to go through all the listings on [ORGANIZATION] and then a Go back to their records to see which ones are verified and which ones are registered with the city There are potentially almost two thousand unregistered [ORGANIZATION] owner occupied rentals in my district and so anybody on ORG2 that fights for affordable housing
12_12_2019,affordable housing,These changes from the original application include and I want to read this because I want people to know exactly what some of the benefits are that we have not mentioned up to this point. One prohibiting front yard parking. Greater setback protections for neighborhood properties to ensure that any new buildings are not towering over adjacent neighbors Most importantly the revised [ORGANIZATION] includes standards for affordable housing and green space Thankfully the current developer has agreed to providing affordable housing and green space but by including this standards in the [ORGANIZATION] This ensures that those standards are written into law and will need to be complied with regardless of who owns the property.
12_12_2019,affordable housing,"Because this project will be going to [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing tax credits, they must receive all city approvals before [ORGANIZATION], before [LOCATION], when their application is due to the state. That is why we need to call a special session DATE2 to reconsider this item immediately. And people would ask, well, why are you doing it immediately?"
12_12_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you, sir Just one question you talked about the affordable housing it will regardless of who with this move regardless of who owns it that that stays that's that's correct regardless of who owns the property we put it into the law that it will remain the same with green space we want to make sure that this green space is permanent that another developer comes and says we're going to build on the green space they can't do it we included those safeguards because the community wanted it and that's why we have the amendments all right thank you very much motion to adjourn second by councilman [PERSON] yeah we approved as amended"
12_26_2023,affordable housing,"It's your ability to influence others to take action. He has demonstrated compassion for his community, for those that are least fortunate. He has fought for affordable housing."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"And people who needed affordable housing, I know I'm a [ORGANIZATION] boy, so I'm a little in a different spot. When they begged for that [STREET] to be redone, and now it's like, let's find the money to put a stadium there. Not saying I'm for it or against it, it is [PERSON] district, and I would yield to however he felt with still wearing my [ORGANIZATION] hat."
11_03_2021,affordable housing,Or else people who need affordable housing in that area that's there will be just put out. councilman [PERSON] yeah
11_26_2019,homeless,"And the thinking is what are we gonna do with this large building, just sit and deteriorate? But with FAC0 and partnership with a number of other developments, [ORGANIZATION], got together and decided there's going to be over 76 apartments in there. There's 20 apartments for the homeless."
12_12_2017,affordable housing,"Next item, anybody else? Next item. Item number 45, affordable housing strategies for the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"And thank you, Mr. [PERSON]. I want to just speak on this just briefly because I think that, you know, we're having some issues and we're talking about inclusionary zoning and affordable housing, and we just happen to be doing some research, you and I, and some other folks regarding this purpose-built community. And I think, you know, when we talk about changing our neighborhood, some of us think that it's just a building."
12_13_2016,affordable housing,"And we're going to continue to do the research and we're talking about the task force, the affordable rents task force and affordable housing task force. Those things, I think, once we really get into that process,  Really, we're trying to turn [ORGANIZATION] around in which we do things on purpose and not by accident. Thank you, Mr. [PERSON]."
01_16_2018,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] is a black and people of color community organization that – is composed of you folks from the community also art um artistically inclined people that are trying to incorporate the social justice movement what we are here to ask for is for the one percent participatory for participatory budget um of our city's 500 million budget we already know that about 28 percent has been going to the police and if Over [ORGANIZATION] that is about an inch for every dollar that the city budget has gotten The police budget has increased by two that that is unacceptable and [LOCATION] to up to ORG1 men have been killed by police instead of and it's not right instead of finding these killer instead of funding these killer cops and We are calling for the money to be used for actual needs of the community, such as creating shelters for the LGBTQ homeless youth, renovating community centers and making them Wi-Fi accessible hubs for the community, creating more community cooperatives, such as urban firing, community food cooperatives for food deserts that exist on the east and west side, an arts and culture cooperative, and child care collective. I'm going to touch base with... She touched it."
01_16_2018,homeless,"I'm going to touch base with them very quickly. As far as the housing for homeless youth, here in [ORGANIZATION] we have a large population of runaway teenagers. I don't have to go too deep into that, we know."
01_16_2018,affordable housing,12 families could be housed there. affordable housing on the east side. They build up the canal side and they're all happy about it
01_16_2018,affordable housing,"This is something that has obviously worked in a lot of other cities, something that we're working on now, and we hope to see more of those across the city, but it does come with extensive resource needs, right? And in most cities, it's only worked when the city provides something in the form of land, in the form of funds, things like that. And so to oversee these initiatives and others that would, you know, increase sustainability within the city itself and also to expand affordable housing opportunities, we would ask that this cabinet-level position is created."
01_10_2023,affordable housing,"But it seems again, it seems you're fixated on the city taking your property and giving it to someone else. I hope that's not the case, but I hope there's someone responsible that's going to do something with that property.  to continue to enhance [ORGANIZATION], enhance downtown, because that's what this is about. How do we continue to develop the downtown area for housing development, even affordable housing?"
03_21_2023,beggar,"[ORGANIZATION], followed him, born on beggar's night. What better [STREET] could I be than [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION]? When [PERSON] became council member, he became the official [ORGANIZATION] member at [ORGANIZATION]."
03_17_2020,affordable housing,"In addition, a novel aspect that has been included, that there was a commitment by the developer  to have 20% of the rental units affordable to individuals earning no more than 80% of the area median income we have created both an enforcement and a monitoring mechanism in this agreement which has us monitoring those units that are not paid for through traditional means of affordable housing finance so if there is a privately financed unit that is a  Uh, um, uh, uh, uh,  that unit does not have the standard requirements of monitoring that comes with federal and state funds, [ORGANIZATION] will be able to monitor that unit and there will also be penalties associated with that if they do not meet that. So that is novel that is in this."
03_17_2020,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] is correct we've had numerous community meetings and we do have an mou we do have a pud which i supported i supported the zoning map amendments i support the townhouses the affordable housing components mwbe but one thing i did do is i committed to the residents that along the [STREET] as this process moved forward i would keep them engaged i certainly support it i understand uh  that city wants to sell off its assets and it's being underutilized. And I agree with you.
03_05_2019,affordable housing,"And also, you know, the perfect... cannot be the enemy of the good because we could demand deeper considerations for affordable housing there. For example, this building was assessed for about 4.4 million in change, and we sold for 3 million, but it's a cash deal. But as Mr. [PERSON] pointed out in our meeting, the [ORGANIZATION] program is we've opted into it."
03_05_2019,affordable housing,"So we see how there's been great appreciation here in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. But nevertheless, according to federal stats, that lower rent is for a family of four would be 80% of the area median income for affordable housing. But if somebody came to us with just a straight subsidy deal, then it would be a lot deeper."
03_05_2019,affordable housing,Councilman PERSON0 Thank you very much. Mr. President. I want to commend council member [PERSON] this and this is something that this common council not only in this particular project has looked to include Affordable housing but in different projects throughout the whole city of [ORGANIZATION] and it was interesting [ORGANIZATION] in caucus while [ORGANIZATION] was there we were talking about a straightforward cash deal with where the developer saw the ability to include affordable housing without layers and layers and layers of incentives and inducements.
03_05_2019,affordable housing,"And I can tell you right now, I would be one, a yes vote [ORGANIZATION] to have diverse downtown and I'm talking about that as far as an income and in other ways I think we have to be ashamed to say that and this is one [STREET] to do it and thank you for the resolution but I also thank the developer for having the foresight and digging in there finding out how to do it how to make it work and not just him I've said it before you know over in the [ORGANIZATION] the site I developer came and said, you know what, we've been hearing you guys beat this drum about affordable housing and mixing in some affordable housing, and we're going to do it. Now, they also, I believe, are coming for some FAC0 and other things."
01_23_2024,affordable housing,"Item number 41, addition of members to [ORGANIZATION]. Motion to adopt. Seconded by [PERSON]."

03_02_2021,homeless,There will be a community [PERSON] meeting regarding...  FAC0 project to put a youth [INSTITUTION] in the community who was not informed of this. And they're outraged by this. And I'm outraged by it.
02_06_2024,affordable housing,"Our goal, and one of the things you'll hear me talk about a lot over [ORGANIZATION] or two, we're going to try to do four things in this city. One, within our community, if we can bring every child up to grade level in their reading and their mathematics, If we can make sure that every home is up to code and that people are living in safe, quality, affordable housing. And if we can make sure that every person who is working or does not have a job is working at their highest capacity so they can earn as much money as they can."
02_06_2024,affordable housing,"Motion to adopt resolvance and the remainder to community development. Seconded by [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON]. Item number 51, progress update on inclusionary zoning ordinance for affordable housing."
02_06_2018,affordable housing,"I think it's unfortunate. And when I met with some of the representatives here [ORGANIZATION], folks from [ORGANIZATION] said to me, we are not against... affordable housing. So I want to be very plain before people went out and say they're obstructionists."
02_06_2018,affordable housing,"But at [DATE], what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong. So affordable housing, this is not even about whether it's affordable housing. This is about what was before this council were two items, and they went back and they changed it."
01_05_2021,affordable housing,that's the president [PERSON] yes council member [PERSON] yes council member [PERSON] council member PERSON3 yes that's my wife yes and what is item before you call the next item i just want to state for the record that the designated developer agreement for 160 162 164 best and [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] because that is obviously city land and the developer is interested in putting housing we have been in  conversation with them about some affordable housing there because this is they do have a market rate project the developer has been very very open to adding a percentage of affordable housing to this program
01_05_2021,affordable housing,"so I just want to thank my colleagues for continuing to have this conversation that when we are going to sell city land and there's going to be a housing project how important in these neighborhoods that have  that are seeing gentrification, that some people are still able to stay. Right now it's an empty lot, nobody's able to live there. But there will be possibly approximately 30 units and the developer is working on at least 10% of those units being affordable housing."
02_19_2019,affordable housing,"It's gratifying to see how quickly this property was found much interest Mr. [PERSON] has [ORGANIZATION] in an offer that's been brought before us the gentleman that's doing FAC0 So it looks like he's putting together a good mix of uses for that building I think it's also important that he pointed out that that 10% of what he wants to carve out will be for affordable housing I heard you on the radio [TIME]. Mr. President and saying that, which was reflecting the resolution that we had adopted here as a body, saying that's a very important component."
02_19_2019,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] is putting in an affordable housing component. um and that's important and it is not even mandated
02_19_2019,affordable housing,"yeah, I agree, we just have to stay on until we get moving some direction legislatively, and that's being worked on. Right now we just met with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and others in the partnership to talk about how we target areas to be able to make sure we get affordable housing in the [ORGANIZATION] is not just market rate next item"
02_19_2019,affordable housing,"I can't live anymore because I can't afford to rent there any longer. My heart goes out to those people and I'm here to speak up on their behalf. So I want to commend the mayor, the administration, especially [PERSON] who brought up this issue on making that particular development affordable housing."
03_07_2017,affordable housing,"Item 16, right to fair and affordable housing. Motion to send to the legislature. I'm sorry."
03_22_2022,homeless,"Send these, the homeless, tempest-lost to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door. Our Father, we thank you that this city is called a city of good neighbors."
03_22_2022,affordable housing,"And a lot of people don't know all the affordable housing going on in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. It only happens by all of that staff up there and by [ORGANIZATION], if [ORGANIZATION] says no, it's hard to get it done. So she makes some hefty decisions and has done a great job in really assisting people, but getting them into houses that are affordable seems to be her heart."
01_09_2018,affordable housing,"There's no policy in front of us yet. We're still working on it. Based on the fact that we're having a discussion about affordable housing for poor people and now some of them say, oh, that would stop a development."
01_09_2018,affordable housing,"Developers are saying, we're going to do it. These are [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] that are now coming in our respective districts and say we're going to do affordable housing in your district. So it can work."
03_31_2020,homeless,"We know that it came in as a late file. But during times like this, when we know that it's cold outside, that people need a [STREET] to stay,  This is a very, very important item. So I thank the administration for caring about the people of the city of [ORGANIZATION], especially those who will find themselves homeless during this time."
03_02_2022,homeless,"Be it youth, senior services, the homeless, we get out there and we do it. I'm so proud of them. We look forward to working hard again  as we did through the pandemic."
05_30_2017,affordable housing,"Second by [PERSON]. Item 45, [ORGANIZATION]. Motion to send to ledge."
06_13_2023,affordable housing,"Second by [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON]. Miscellaneous, item number 73, affordable housing task. Motion to adopt."
05_16_2017,affordable housing,And I've talked to the developer on this because this is market rate housing with no affordable housing. The reason I'm pushing the approval or suggesting approval is because this was in the pipeline [ORGANIZATION] before we started talking about inclusionary housing. So I don't think it would be fair on this property to then hold the developer to a standard that we were not talking about then.
05_16_2017,affordable housing,"I have since talked to the developer, and his name is public, Mr. [PERSON], and asked him if it was possible in any [STREET] to include some affordable housing in this development. But what I did assure him, and I state this now and forever hold my peace until something changes, is that when city land is being sold for development,  I am going to do as much as I possibly can to encourage developers until there's an inclusionary zoning law to include some type of affordable or workforce housing in their development. I told them I was going to state this for the record, told the community [TIME], some of who are here, who were concerned about this development, who came to us even during the committees."
05_16_2017,affordable housing,"I just feel that when developers are going to do this type of project and they need something from the city,  As one of my colleagues here in [ORGANIZATION] say that they show the city some love. Some would say, hey, why? Well, if we don't do it, if we don't push for affordable housing and workplace housing, we will more than likely never get it."
05_16_2017,affordable housing,"And what [ORGANIZATION] said to me, let's work together, and this is what I like to hear from developers, let's work together, let's see what, if we need some type of tax break to make it happen, if we need it, and these are the type of projects I would push forward every dime we can get our hands on to keep  affordable housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you, Mr. [PERSON]. Thank you for your support on that."
05_16_2017,affordable housing,"That's one we discussed. That's for the affordable housing. I just, it just clicked."
07_11_2023,affordable housing,"Second by [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON]. Item number 19, [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] Annual Action Plan. Okay, I'm going to motion to approve, but I was told that I'm going to get additional information regarding the demolitions of 480,000, a detailed list of where those demolitions are going to occur for some affordable housing."
07_27_2023,affordable housing,"I think we...  might be able to put it in. However, I also have concerns, any money that is not spent for any categories for that matter. There are a number of categories from health to  first line arts, health equity, affordable housing."
05_12_2020,homelessness,"In Chapter 3, these verses... The thought of my suffering and homelessness is bitter beyond words. I'll never forget this awful time as I grieve over my loss."
05_12_2020,homelessness,"Therefore, I hope in him. What a contrast between the bitterness, the suffering, the homelessness, the awful times, the grief, the loss, but then comes the point of hope, the point of a better [ORGANIZATION]. As one of the television stations says right now, this too shall pass."
04_19_2022,affordable housing,"And the city commissioned this to make city welcoming, to make sure that many of the needs of the new Americans, the new residents that are here,  received the assistance, whether it was employment, affordable housing, secure housing, policing, language, access, translation, interpretation, health,  health, making sure that people understood how government worked for them. I think it's very important. And I just want to commend the administration for ensuring that this study was done."
09_15_2020,affordable housing,"Thank you Mr. [PERSON]. and of course uh [ORGANIZATION] if it wasn't for [ORGANIZATION] a lot of people would not have affordable housing and it wouldn't be generated within our community um because [ORGANIZATION] works very hard with community groups so we're praying for her hearing another we continue to remember um  the men and women who may have given their life for the freedom of our country and others since our last meeting, and all of the names that have been called, we pause for a moment of silence. Thank you."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"Second by [PERSON]. Miscellaneous. Item number 51, [ORGANIZATION]."
07_11_2017,homeless,"Second by President [PERSON]. Item 89, waive event fees for [ORGANIZATION] outrace for homeless female veterans. Motion to approve."
06_27_2017,affordable housing,"So that you'll send this to [ORGANIZATION], which is actively meeting. And I wanted you all to have it to be able to weigh in also. Because that [STREET] we'll get to good policy."
06_27_2017,affordable housing,"And so I think together, we work together, and I've said it before, with developers, with people, but also remembering that we do have an affordable housing problem. study that we've been promised. They're scheduling the release of that, and then that will show us the real numbers."
06_27_2017,affordable housing,"I mean, they're coming into [ORGANIZATION] almost every meeting to show us future development. And the good thing about it, some of those developments are even showing us where affordable housing is working. And that is something we should also speak about, that we have developers that have come before us."
06_27_2017,affordable housing,"There have been people that have been contacted, and we know this, that have been questioned to say affordable housing or affordable inclusionary zoning is bad, and they have resisted doing that. And I stand up for those people that have resisted. So thank you once again and all our colleagues that have...  maintain an open mind and hopefully we can work through this complicated process."
06_27_2017,affordable housing,"You know, this is not a one-size-fits-all situation, but we must do something and we've been very patient  and patient and waiting. And as we continue to wait, there's people who are up here desperate for outcomes of affordable housing. So we can sit on the sideline and we can kind of, you know, DATE0 [TIME] quarterback about this process, but we know that we've been pressing."
06_27_2017,affordable housing,"And why I am very encouraged by Ms. [PERSON]'s questionnaire, because it starts that conversation. And we have citizens who are not elected who are going to fill out that questionnaire, who each council member has had the opportunity to appoint to that affordable housing task force, and if you haven't, you still can. And so, very good."
06_27_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON], last word. I just want to say one thing, and I commend you for putting together [ORGANIZATION]."
07_25_2023,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has been in the community for [ORGANIZATION]. The majority of services we provide are in [ORGANIZATION]. We support many people with developmental disabilities, but we also support people without disabilities in the areas of employment, affordable housing, domestic violence,  We regularly are in a neighborhood and have someone call and say, hey, we hear you help people."
06_11_2024,housing crisis,"And if you look at the tax rolls of where a large part of the tax base is driven, it's off those buildings. And then you go to cities around the world, they have thriving urban. dense downtowns that derive not only cultural attractions, but you have a multitude of mixed use housing options, especially in a housing crisis that we're facing here in the city of [ORGANIZATION] because we don't have enough inventory."
04_16_2019,affordable housing,"And this project, one of the things about this project that I am pleased with is the affordable housing component. Now, I want to be clear that if the developer had went with [ORGANIZATION], which they probably would have qualified, we would not have the control to be able to include the community benefits agreement, which when we looked at the research back to [ORGANIZATION], the reason for this article heavily leaned on minority business – opportunities in the project. The second thing is if we are ever going to change and make [ORGANIZATION] more inclusive, and when I'm talking about that, I'm talking about economically in certain areas, there are going to probably have to be some benefits at times."
04_16_2019,affordable housing,"This developer would not be able to get any tax break on every property, or the developer would have to come back to this council. And I want to be clear, and I want to be heard loud and clear. The affordable housing component is the only reason that I'm supporting this article at this point for this project."
04_16_2019,affordable housing,"If a developer comes and asks for a market, full market rate, They need to pay for full market rate unless there's a reason we're becoming involved. But this one, from the beginning, I asked [PERSON] when they came to us, I ask because the people are asking for affordable housing and to see if there's a [STREET] that that could work. With Article 16, we do have that oversight and be able to monitor the project."
04_16_2019,affordable housing,"Now, I asked the question from [ORGANIZATION] and from [LOCATION], PERSON2. If the tax break, if the gap in the project, for instance, is $1 million, and these are just numbers I'm making up, and the developer is getting a $3 million tax break, to me that's not fair. This should only be to fill that gap so that the affordable housing."
04_16_2019,affordable housing,"And so what I was told is we could ask for even more affordable housing in that project. And I intend to look at every dime to see and make sure that we are not making a making it just easy for a developer to say, hey, just give me a tax break. I'll just throw it out to the wind."
04_16_2019,affordable housing,"I know one was out for [ORGANIZATION], and you heard not a peep. Now when we're talking about affordable housing, Now the question is why do this for a fort? Why do this?"
04_16_2019,affordable housing,I want to see it used. There's some places in [ORGANIZATION] that I want to see this article used. because we want to make sure we use every tool in the toolbox to keep affordable housing.
04_16_2019,affordable housing,"DATE0 we can possibly move this along, but going forward, the benefits, the public benefits, and I'm a big proponent, just as you are, many of us, on on [ORGANIZATION] and the percentage, the MI, because we want to truly make it affordable for people that live and want to live in that area that wouldn't normally be able to live in that area. So that's something that my votes going forward would be predicated on those public benefits, and certainly the benefits to the developers themselves. We have to look very carefully because this is taxpayers' money that we're doling out, and we want to make sure there is a true public benefit to the community."
04_16_2019,affordable housing,"After talking to Mr. [PERSON] for [TIME], You know, I was inclined, I had a lot of questions about this, but after conversation with him, I will vote for this, the affordable housing component. There's a, the city owns a parking garage that we're going to sell to them. That this is not a tax break of any kind that has never come before us at this point."
04_16_2019,affordable housing,"And we will have all of that information. There is a connection, though, between the tax break. seeking that and an understanding that this council very fairly looks upon the affordable housing aspect of this."
06_25_2024,homeless,"We pray for the homeless, that this deliberative body will understand how we can address the need for everybody. To have a safe roof over their heads. We pray for those that are mentally ill, Lord."
03_30_2021,homeless,"But because of some internal issues, we didn't get it filed, but it is here now. I want to thank all the residents who stood up and got involved because there was something happening that [ORGANIZATION] was putting a facility for  children, homeless youth in their district. And some people on the surface might think that, why are we fighting against that?"
03_30_2021,homeless,"Well, we're fighting because they weren't informed. So they wanted to open up a youth center or youth housing [INSTITUTION] in their community without a single conversation to them, with them. And this has been going on, have been planned since [ORGANIZATION]."
05_21_2020,homeless,"So the reason I would be, if we heard absolutely nothing, if nothing changed, that we would come back to the table before [ORGANIZATION], I mean, before [LOCATION], would be because we'd be homeless, basically, is how I equate it. Then you have to make some different types of decisions. The second thing and final for me is that the same [STREET] that right now the administration isn't doing a loan package because they're waiting."
05_03_2022,affordable housing,"And these are very large historic structures that house well over 200 units. And where we're at within the neighborhood is these buildings could have been sold off and been market rate apartments for $1,500 a pop. And I was thrilled that when [ORGANIZATION] had purchased and acquired these properties and having a commitment and being an affordable housing developer and making sure that folks that have lived there for generations are able to live in these buildings and live in them with dignity and security."
06_27_2023,homelessness,"majority of those are from [ORGANIZATION] and the majority of those are from the city of [PERSON]. That work has evolved dramatically over [ORGANIZATION], particularly as we receive more data information telling us how not only are LGBTQ young people at higher risk for suicide, homelessness, drug addiction, but particularly black LGBTQ young people are at even higher risks of suicide, homelessness, and drug addiction. And so by being able to be in the community, being able to be held up and recognized by our community leaders is really the most important thing that we can do so that they know that they're, as the Councilman pointed out, don't feel like there's something wrong with them."
06_27_2023,homeless,"Motion to send to CD items four through 19. Second by [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON]. On item four, this is the [INSTITUTION] area."
05_14_2019,housing crisis,"Now as much as we would like to say great job Mayor [PERSON] for the economic development, the economic resurgence that we're experiencing here, there are some extraneous factors that we're facing and have to contend with as well. as it relates to the housing crisis that we're going through, as it relates to the displacement of folks living in their homes for [ORGANIZATION], who now, because of rental hikes and rental increases, have been displaced. I believe that housing should be a human right, as a lot of advocates have stated in the past, and that people should not have to live in their homes in fear of eviction or in fear of displacement."
