There's a class of property laws called ""adverse possession"" that allow people to gain rights to abandoned property after occupying by some set amount of time. And you actually have to ""unlawfully"" occupy it to obtain those rights. The idea behind it is that if a property is abandoned by the owner, that it doesn't site underutilized.

You're right, the occupier can't force the landlord to let them stay there if they've been there [ORGANIZATION]. The owner can trespass that person, and have them removed if they've been there [ORGANIZATION].

However, if the landlord is absentee and doesn't notice and the person is there for [LOCATION], then they get tenants rights and have to go through the standard eviction process. The squatter can still get removed via the eviction process. The squatter doesn't get ownership over the property. That takes DATE2 of adverse possession.

perhaps that should be more reason for me to be willing to help others, but from experience I discovered that many homeless aren't ready to even accept true help if it requires actual effort on their part.

you're right that it is a symptom of a much larger societal problem though. hopefully we can see some improvements in the future for our city and others.",homeless

Homelessness can easily be prevented if governments take effective measures and the concept of charity is not helpful long term in achieving a more equitable society. So I’m not blaming you, but the idea that “I made it so why can’t they?” is really unhelpful in this situation and literally every other scenario where trauma, poverty, mental/physical health, etc is involved. You are right that many people are not in a position to accept help and even so, the “help” we can give individuals is so little in comparison to what larger societal changes need to take [STREET].","homeless, homelessness"
9,2023-12-19 18:04:52 UTC,13,2023-12-19 19:44:39 UTC,[ORGANIZATION],"Most of the shelters require [ORGANIZATION] referrals. The only ones I’ve known to not were FAC0 and FAC1, apparently now [ORGANIZATION] is not through [ORGANIZATION] either. Each of these were extremely challenging to get people into, even with an advocate from an agency that worked very closely with the shelters. 

If shelters are full though, [ORGANIZATION] has to provide shelter somewhere - often a motel. If people don’t follow through with the placement, or return to [ORGANIZATION] for follow up, [ORGANIZATION] will essentially blacklist the individual for a period of time and refuse to provide them shelter/services. [ORGANIZATION] will not provide transportation, even if they [STREET] you in [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON], unless you’re a family - sorry single folks, it’s wrong but it’s the [STREET] it is [ORGANIZATION] (unless recent changes). 

When it’s below 32 degrees, there should be a code blue where shelters open up and are pretty much barrier free for anyone who needs a [STREET] to stay. Code blue as I knew it was accessible by showing up to the shelter, the downtown [INSTITUTION], calling ORG2, or going to [PERSON]. Code Blue used to operate out of FAC2, now out of FAC3 more recently. Unless my info is out of date - someone please correct me if I’m wrong. 

[ORGANIZATION] has really dropped the ball serving people in crisis. [PERSON] if they realize the population they’re serving is going through crisis, and may have multiple other crises ongoing (traumatic experiences leading to and during their homelessness, mental health, substance use, not knowing where they’ll sleep or eat next, untreated medical issues, etc). They will refuse to help people if they can find a reason, it’s terrible. PERSON0 forbid someone be expressing their frustration/fear/etc during a period of crisis and trauma. Also, I know you want to help, but I will let you know that if you’re paying to put someone in a hotel and [ORGANIZATION] learns of that they will refuse to serve them as a homeless individual because they’ll consider them housed by you. 

Agencies like [PERSON] and [PERSON] were great resources in the past, and I highly encourage anyone who may be homeless or need info to contact them. You’re likely to get helpful info and action steps, and possibly an advocate depending on your situation. Still, if you need shelter on any given night, you will need to go to [ORGANIZATION] or call [TIME].


Edit: Go to a coordinated entry hub if you meet the definition of homelessness, they can help you get linked to services [PERSON]

The reality is that the [ORGANIZATION] could donate the tent and camping supplies to a local nonprofit that could make good use of it.

[PERSON], nightlife, restaurants, museums, historic sites, trendy [ORGANIZATION], we have all that here.

There's not really much of a homeless problem. Especially compared to cities down [LOCATION] or out [PERSON] where tent cities are common. You don't really see that here. High minimum wage, cheap rent and the climate probably helps.

These are the popular walkable neighborhoods with nice local commercial districts.

* [PERSON] - Directly [LOCATION] downtown. Great if you're into nightlife. Allen [STREET] can get pretty crazy on [ORGANIZATION] until 5 am.
* GPE2 - [LOCATION] [PERSON]. Lots of young professionals and students, but a little quieter than [PERSON]
* North [ORGANIZATION] - anything [LOCATION] LOC1. [ORGANIZATION] is probably the best commercial [STREET] in the city in terms of variety of shops, restaurants and bars.

**Up and coming areas**

These places are still rough around the edges, but have seen a lot of development in [LOCATION]. Generally speaking it looks sketchier than it actually is.

* LOC2 - [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION] State. Lots of new breweries, lofts and startup space. Plus the only ORG1 in the city proper.
* LOC3 - Anything [PERSON] of GPE4. Lots of nice mini commercial districts with plenty of hidden gems in terms of shops, cafes and restaurants. FAC0 and FAC1 are solid. FAC2 and [PERSON] streets are improving. Also a lot of great new wave ethnic cuisine. Definitely check out the LOC3 [ORGANIZATION].
* LOC6 - I covered this below.
* [PERSON] East of Downtown. This is a warehouse district you wouldn't believe was completely abandoned DATE2. Now it acts as a second CBD and lately there's been more focus on apartments and [ORGANIZATION] amenities. Check out Food Truck DATE4!

* [ORGANIZATION] has been slowly implementing its complete streets plan. It takes a long time to get to every [STREET], especially the ones with high traffic volume that require additional studies and funding 
* Expansion is entirely up to the [ORGANIZATION] at the moment and the N[ORGANIZATION] will propose several additional [ORGANIZATION] lines as part of their new Master Plan due in [ORGANIZATION]
* There’s actually a record amount of subsidized housing being built right now including completely rebuilding both FAC0 and FAC1
* Homeless shelters only mask the symptoms, they aren’t a long term solution. We need more affordable housing, transitional housing and more long term care facilities
* The city/state has done a great job at attracting non-rusty jobs to the city. From medium sized tech companies to startups and from film industry jobs to light manufacturing

At [DATE] it all comes down to funding. The city only has so much money and there’s only so many federal and state grants.

There’s some things the city could do with the state permission to make things a little better:

* Land Use Tax - A modest land use tax could generate as much as $20 million per year
* Reinstate Tolls on the 190 - a $1 toll could raise $30 million per year

That’s $50 million to work with.

Unfortunately, that’s still not a TON of money. That’s enough to build 3 miles of new streetscapes with [ORGANIZATION], OR 280 units of affordable housing.

Of course over [LOCATION] that can really add up, but it’s still going to take [DATE] and that still doesn’t cover the immense cost of say long term care facilities for addiction and mental healthcare.

[ORGANIZATION] probably needs:

* $2 billion to modernize the streetscape of every major [STREET] with bike and bus infrastructure and [ORGANIZATION] facilities. 
* $5 billion to build 25,000 new affordable housing units to meet current demand 
* $1 billion to build several long term care facilities and fund them for [LOCATION]

That being said, if someone on the streets has managed to scrap together a few bucks and wants to toss one of those on a lotto ticket on the chance that they will win and escape their current reality, is that such a bad thing?  I mean, as I’ve pointed out, there’s almost no chance that they’ll win, but if that’s what they want to spend a portion of their money on because that absurdly low chance gives them hope, how is it hurting me or the people who gave him or her a dollar or two?

Do you think that they are not going to spend some of their earnings on food just because they also bought a lottery ticket?  That they are going to completely forgo a basic biological need?  Or do you believe that these people are “scamming” the public pretending that they don’t have need money for food and by offering up a buck you are merely paying for someone’s lotto tickets?

Before you point out that there are services and housing available for the homeless, understand that these are all available in limited amounts.  When the food or beds run out, that’s it.  You’re told, “I’m sorry, better luck [ORGANIZATION]” and you’re put out on the streets to fend for yourself.

Even those who have been able to secure a [STREET] to sleep off the streets for [TIME] and have managed to find a bite to eat for [LOCATION] will find themselves scavenging for a buck here and there.  Why not?  Isn’t that what we all do?  Try to make more than the bare minimum?  And as someone in that situation, if you’re going to use your “excess” money to buy a lottery ticket is it in your best interest to say that to a person walking by?

Hell, I don’t even care if the actual dollar I give away goes to booze if that’s what it takes to make your life a little more bearable.  Fuck me if I’m to tell you how to spend your money.  My only hope is that you’re doing your best to get by and take care of yourself.

Sadly, many people we refer to as “homeless” are well aware of the fact that most people on the [STREET] will only donate when it is under the context of feeding them.

Probably not.

Yet, as poor as those decisions are, can you really blame them?

And given that you wouldn’t provide a dollar to them if they were being honest, can you blame them for claiming that every dollar goes to paying for food?

For almost as long as there have been schools, educators have pointed to a student’s socioeconomic background as the greatest determinant of – or excuse for – why some succeed and others do[LOCATION].

It’s an explanation that makes [ORGANIZATION] report from [ORGANIZATION] all the more puzzling – and damning.

How could homeless kids in [ORGANIZATION] – bouncing from shelter to shelter or living out of a car – do as well or better on average than ORG1 students who never have been homeless?

[PERSON], [PERSON]’s kids as a whole are a little bit poorer than [ORGANIZATION]’s. State data pegs 79 percent of [PERSON]’s students as economically disadvantaged, compared to 71 percent in [ORGANIZATION]. Nor is [PERSON] alone in underperforming compared to homeless kids downstate. [PERSON] and [PERSON] fared much worse in the comparison.

But the 8 point gap in poverty is not enough to explain the test score disparity, and the fact that other districts are doing even worse does[LOCATION] excuse [PERSON]’s poor performance.

According to the report, 21 percent of [ORGANIZATION]’s homeless kids and 41 percent of students who had never been homeless passed the state’s DATE1 English exam. That compares to 10 percent of [PERSON]’s homeless pupils, and just 18 percent of [PERSON] students who were never homeless. In math, 19 percent of [ORGANIZATION]’s homeless and 40 percent of its never-homeless students passed, compared to just 7 percent of [PERSON]’s homeless and 18 percent of its never homeless kids.

One explanation is that [ORGANIZATION] has put a big emphasis on educating its homeless population, said [ORGANIZATION], deputy director of [ORGANIZATION]. That emphasis includes ""intense tracking of students from a young age,"" starting in kindergarten and first grade and not waiting until state tests begin in third grade, she said.

And it means providing social and academic support, such as encouraging kids to do homework in after-school programs where it’s quieter than in a [INSTITUTION].

[ORGANIZATION] also has focused on community schools that stay open nights and DATE2 and provide extra services.

""In [PERSON], the community schools initiative is relatively new,"" she said by [STREET] of contrast.

In fact, it did[LOCATION] arrive until [PERSON] was hired in [LOCATION]. That was long after [ORGANIZATION] took control of [ORGANIZATION]’s schools while mayor. PERSON3, president of ORG2 – one of the partners in the report – noted that much of [ORGANIZATION]’s improvement came during PERSON4’s tenure.

What was [PERSON] doing during that time?

Arguing over who should or should[LOCATION] be superintendent and hemming and hawing over mayoral control.

Now [ORGANIZATION] points to mental health supports in schools, universal prekindergarten and smaller class sizes as well as community schools – with their after-school and [PERSON] programming – as part of the effort to put ""a huge bear hug around all of our students."" He also cites Say Yes [PERSON]’s wraparound services.

Those are the supports vulnerable kids need regardless of where they live.

""My thing is to help all of our children; that’s what we’re trying to do,"" [ORGANIZATION] said.

That [ORGANIZATION] was on to that long before [PERSON] does[LOCATION] say much for those in charge here before [ORGANIZATION]’s arrival.

In other words, leadership matters. Without it, kids pay dearly.",homeless

It has been proven that poverty and crime are interlinked; by addressing issues of extreme and drastic poverty; you significantly reduce crime.

[[URL]

This has been proven. I will throw endless research documents down. Simple sociology 101 that you learn in college; or even high school if you graduated.

When [PERSON] did this; he addressed crime; not by putting a police officer on every corner. If anything, they didn't help. Before he was even mayor, FAC0. Further more; actually; [ORGANIZATION] was a massive riot where 1,000 off-duty police officers rioted against the creation of a civilian-lead consul for police oversight. So yeah, why not add more police officers to that?

Further more; police cost about 1.22 million for each officer; including their equipment, training; etc. Each new police officer reduces crime about 0.6 percent or drops homicides specifically by 1%. This is over districts. Provincial regions/municipalities within the city. In order to actually reduce crime; you would need to hire hundreds of officers. Blow through hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars that we simply don't have.

[[URL]

Instead. We could take that money and reduce poverty. Direct aid, mutual aid; city-block spanning centers to feed and supply the growing lower class of [ORGANIZATION]. The point of defunding is to stop hiring armed mercenaries to enforce the interests of the state, but rather make specific forces and institutions to combat unique cases of poverty and desolation in many communities that have been subjected to systematic exploitation or suffered the darker side of global trade. Civilian-led institutions with complete democratic accountability, for each community and region as needed. 

But nah. Police officers. ***Because you know; people won't end up at downtown, ramming trucks through police barricades, trying to set [INSTITUTION] on fire and throwing bricks. Of course the police around here wouldn't ever crack an innocent old man's skull on the pavement and leave him bleeding out while preventing paramedics from approaching!***

* Couples with no kids (with a partner you actually do[LOCATION] even have to be working much over minimum wage to afford these)
* Remote workers with out-of-state salaries

I can’t give advice on how to make kummelweck rolls from scratch, but a cheap-out solution would just be to buy hard rolls, dampen the top, and sprinkle some rock salt and caraway seeds on top, and toast briefly, just until the salt and seeds are adhered. Then warm store bought roast beef in au jus, slice the roll in half, pile the roast beef on the bottom, barely dip the top into the au jus, and eat.

Jobs here are great if you know people, if you social network you can make money in this town. If you are secluded and keep to yourself chances are you will only make min wage or just above.

There is a huge income disparity in ORGANIZATION.
I have found myself homeless here twice in [ORGANIZATION]. 

Once because of a job that closed (FAC1). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

(Disclaimer: Being white and educated doesn't mean you aren't poor, a lot of people are educated here and job competition is vicious.)
I am white.
I have a DATE1 degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, [ORGANIZATION] can be a great city to live in.

23% of families live below the poverty line and there are definitely run down parts of town where you'd find drug paraphernalia. However, you probably won't be hanging out in these areas.

Being in [PERSON], many residents are able to benefit from more generous welfare. While the minimum wage us $9 an hour, if you work part time or are a single parent, you'll likely qualify for some assistance.

As for young professionals: Bio-med, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], Marketing and [PERSON] offer a lot of high paying jobs for college grads. There's also a lot of call centers that pay a bit higher than minimum wage.

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than [ORGANIZATION]. Everything from slavery to [ORGANIZATION] to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many [ORGANIZATION]. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit [ORGANIZATION] may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're [ORGANIZATION] from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.

1) Market rate new construction often occurs *after* housing prices have climbed. The subsequent “drop” in prices in the surrounding area are almost fractions of a percentage, and never back to pre-climb prices, and most often this has been studied in much larger cities ([ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]) while cities more similar to GPE2 (GPE3) actually saw an *increase correlation to new construction.

2) They specifically state the solution is *affordable housing* in neighborhoods like [PERSON], because the market rate housing does not significantly lower prices. Statistically sure, but from a lifestyle perspective, an overall 1% decrease in rent in surrounding new construction is not meaningful. 

3) Gentrification is still happening, and not just because the previous residents “die” or find more affordable housing, but because suddenly when they walk down the [STREET] they’ve lived on for [ORGANIZATION], they get dirty looks, or have the cops called on them, or are followed in stores that opened in *their* neighborhood.

To solve increased housing prices in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and GPE2, there needs to be new construction sure, but there also needs to be an effort by the city to densify and improve *other* neighborhoods as well. Downtown has dozens of block-size parking lots where this development should occur; [PERSON] was so thoroughly firebombed by [ORGANIZATION] that there’s few “centers” left, but they should focus development around existing nodes.

That's not related to the claim you just made, though, which is that any attempt to control the price of housing other than simply allowing the ""free market"" to choose results in higher prices for the general population. I think if you made your claim more specific (like saying that means-tested affordable housing developments detract from the overall housing supply and therefore increase prices for others) it might be fair, but since there are so many different ways of controlling the price of housing its essentially meaningless. In general, programs aimed at correcting only the absolute worst manifestations of the housing crisis have very little impact on people who aren't quite as desperate, but who are still burdened. Programs that don't make any attempt at all to target specific inequalities (like just letting the free market run wild with housing prices, as you're suggesting) at best don't have any impact on the lives of the *most* desperate.

That's why action on housing needs to target *the entire housing market*, and that means actively disrupting the monopoly that landlords and developers have on housing. Policies like rent control, increased tenant protections, *un-means tested* socialized housing, etc. would all work to decrease the price of housing for everyone.

On one hand, they are providing more apartments, so it could drop the area unit / house rates. If this happened, this would be a good natural adjustment, and this new building can either struggle to fill, or drop price. I am a landlord (owner occupied, but a taste for the concept), and I respect people need to live in a home, but I charge fair area rates, not what I can to get by. If they price them competitively, which happens to be in the more generally affordable territory, they are going to be swept up very fast being brand new, updated, prime location, and usually these buildings also offer 'community benefits' (pool / gym / discounts at retail).

I'd argue this is the price of 'new' and the more appropriate battles might be for either used buildings or appearance. Maybe force them to do something interesting community wise, to tie them into benefiting it. I don't have any ideas, but that makes more sense than arguing what they want to charge to me.

If you aren't satisfied with the price, can't consumers voice with their dollars?

Um...no. They're ""anti development"" because they don't want their neighborhood getting torn asunder for no reason except to line a developer's pockets. The ""out of character"" comments refer to building these giant skyscrapers around the corner from a [STREET] filled with homes. Furthermore, the ""affordable housing"" complaints usually come from not from the Green Code/Preseration people, but the developers themselves. There was even a ORG1 ""guest editorial"" not too long ago from a couple of big-money developers saying that forcing affordable units in new construction would only harm [ORGANIZATION]'s growth. (Wait, so guaranteeing that people have a chance of quality housing regardless of income is a [ORGANIZATION] thing? [ORGANIZATION]). Nearly every Green Code/Preservation advocate I've talked to is not only for affordable housing, but wants it in law that separate units be set aside in new builds for that purpose. Meanwhile I've seen many more development zealots either shoot down the affordable housing law, or at least want it built away from the ""hot"" neighborhoods.

>There are literally three people ([ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], PERSON2) who are desperately fighting to keep [PERSON] a white upper class bastion. No three people have done more to destroy a neighborhood / city anywhere in the country than they have to [PERSON] / [ORGANIZATION]. Just look at the absolute dichotomy between [PERSON] and ORG2. DATE1 [PERSON] was actually pretty nice and ORG2 was a total shithole. Then a bunch of Millennials and intelligent business owners moved into North [ORGANIZATION] and there was development with relatively deminimus resistance to the development. The situation has now totally changed, with ORG2 as a dynamic, growing neighborhood and scores of empty restaurants and commercial space on [PERSON]. Literally caused by three hateful, ignorant people.

First, let's stop hyperbolizing the ORG2 resurgence. It may not have been ""the"" destination DATE2, but by no means was it a ""shithole"" or has made a momentous comeback from being a veritable war zone like FAC0. It had plenty of long-time businesses and establishments. It was still a desirable neighborhood for young couples to live until Junior was old enough for school, in which they headed for suburbs. (I know this because I know people who admitted they did just that. Not for racial differences, but because of the [ORGANIZATION] School system). Yes it is more popular now, but spare me the whole heroic rags-to-riches narrative. And the empty storefronts on [PERSON]? Not caused by the people you mention. Caused by the many absentee landlords who own(ed) buildings on the strip. The most promintent being [ORGANIZATION], notorious for overcharging rents and neglecting his properties. These among other buildings were always the chronically empty, until recently when [ORGANIZATION] bought him out.

>The idea that that there were many (if any) commentators openly hoping for any commercial establishments to shut down is laughable.

Read the article about [LOCATION], prime example of it right there.

**TL;DR the current low income housing tax credit is an investor and bank giveaway, we'd be better served by directly investing in real public housing**

The density of this project is good, but it highlights the insanity of [ORGANIZATION] DATE1 Low Income Housing Tax Credit (aka LIHTC) and privatization of public housing, to what is a massive handout to developers and their investors.

The article in [ORGANIZATION] about this project labels this an $86 million dollar project with 246 units, $16 million and 80 units in the emergency [INSTITUTION] which is paid for by the state. 

Emergency shelter aside, that leaves the affordable housing component at 163 units for $70 million. [ORGANIZATION] had originally reported the cost at $15 million (which is a little revealing if you ask me).

That leaves us at a cost per unit at $430,000. 

Let's look at a comparison nearby. FAC0 apartments a few blocks away, similar style, format and materials was reported to cost $35 million for 215 market rate units and commercial space. Cost per unit, $162,000.

Seems steep right? How did an affordable housing project jump from costing $15 mil to $70 mil, at nearly three times the rate of comparable market units? Are the units going to really cost that much more than market rate housing?

How does the LIHTC work?

The developer of the project, if meeting income limits on the units, can automatically claim credits of 4% of the qualified basis of [DATE], for DATE2. (qualified basis = essentially total development and construction cost of the building). The state can direct additional to raise this to 9%. If the project is in a qualified census tract, it gets boosted to 130% of that. Finally, the tax credits are non-refundable, but transferable. Which means they must be used to offset income in [LOCATION], but can be transferred to investors to offset taxes they would normally pay on income and investments.

So what does that mean? It means the developers have every incentive to inflate the cost basis of their project. Why? Because the larger the cost, the bigger the tax credit, the more tax credits can essentially be sold to banks and investment funds. 

All said, on development costs alone at $70 million, **this project will generate roughly somewhere from $28 - $82 million in tax credits to be largely sold or transferred.** I'd love to be wrong on this, so if I am offbase please correct me.

The tax credit ends up being a round-about handout to banks and investors with a small number of affordable units as a side effect. We'd be much better served by the state or federal government building affordable units themselves or allocating fixed per-unit grants, than allowing this free-for-all.

To me, this is a big reason for the ""missing middle"" of new affordable middle-class housing.","homeless, affordable housing"
14,2016-05-05 12:18:00 UTC,-1,2016-05-05 13:47:46 UTC,"[ORGANIZATION], other groups want new projects to include units for low-income renters","Why would developers raise rent for the top 2/3rds? Solely to make more money or ""break even""? That's not the fault of poor people trying to get a decent apartment, that's based on developers being greedy. Development is going fine in [ORGANIZATION] as long as you aren't poor. The west side is gentrifying, along with several other parts of the city. Yeah that's good for the tax base but it also means the poor people (and refugees on the west side) who have had to live in those previously shitty areas for [ORGANIZATION] are [ORGANIZATION]ed out because they can't afford the rent costs. You have to try and make some accommodations for everyone which is what this plan is attempting to do. If developers weren't completely focused on greed then these places would have 1/3 of the apartments for low income people and then have a range of costs between the rest. That helps to stop the cycle of poor people being [ORGANIZATION]ed into the next terrible part of the city.


I think the 1 out of 3 number is to high, but they're trying to make a point that housing needs to exist for lower income people. Most housing they can afford is terribly insulated and falling apart. The idea here is that developers coming in will have to work with the community and groups like [ORGANIZATION] to ensure their is affordable housing instead of allowing them to just build super nice lofts and shit and [PERSON] up the rent prices. That's when gentrification happens and that's when the poor people who oftentimes have been there for awhile get [ORGANIZATION]ed out.

I don't think the goal is to screw over middle income earners in favor of low income earners, it's to provide some influence and power for the poor people nobody cares about (read the comment below yours). It's not a handout to have a livable apartment, it's a right. Im in the same boat as you money-wise and it sucks that we don't have a ton of great options, but I don't think that means that poor people shouldn't have any options.

Edit: I'm not trying to sound aggressive or accusatory so I'm sorry if it reads that [STREET].

This is one market reality.  But it seems to ignore another in that without strong market rate and high end housing the tax base is hurt.  Which in turn stunts the growth of the city and takes away the ability to provide services to the poor.  

It also says nothing to the entitlement factor that poor are not entitled to **new** housing.  The focus should be on quality/livable housing.  They are not the same.  

> Maybe one out of 5 would be easier? Maybe throw in some tax incentives to make this voluntary?

It should be closer to 5% rather than 10% [ORGANIZATION].  Incentives of some kind should also be required...but orgs like [ORGANIZATION] don't bother with these details.  That's probably the most concerning thing.  [ORGANIZATION] just wants the city to require stuff 'just because' and 'poor people' but that's not how the world works.  

I like the idea of a cash payment fund affordable housing **if** the developer does not want to include affordable housing in their project.  But in order for the city to 'wet their beak' on this they need to offer something in return.  Maybe improving or fast tracking a project that in turn saves the developer an equal about of the ~~bribe~~ affordable housing contribution?  

Like it or not, developers need to make a return on their investment.  If they target a specific demographic for lease or sale they should be free to target this class without restrictions.  ",affordable housing

Of course, it would be cheaper.  But [ORGANIZATION] does not need any more poorly designed 'cheap' affordable housing.  Design goes beyond what the facade looks like.  The layout of this housing complex is poor.  The layout inside of the buildings is poor.  It would be difficult, if not impossible, to make these buildings mixed use w/o demolishing them anyways.  

What it needs are better neighborhoods.  What the city needs are modern walkable neighborhoods and that's only possible with mixed use.  Affordable housing also needs to be in walkable neighborhoods as that removes a dependence on transportation which rolls down to changing the income dynamic for residents, which in turn, helps upward mobility.  

Changing these 41 acres to include retail and commercial rather than just reskinning is what can unlock opportunity for those who live there rather than just wasting millions on putting lipstick on a pig.  

My personal take is the reason why [ORGANIZATION] wants to reskin is it's a lot easier to hand out payback contracts to donors when it's a rehab rather than needing developers to run the project.  

> Also sounds like there is a bit more to the project (or better be at least). Look up renderings for the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, which was the original plan in [ORGANIZATION]. Not sure why the plan was never enacted upon. Pretty sure the project won some federal funding.
