If the management company that sent these 2 clean up guys knew that there was a squatter there, and/or knew that he may have been dangerous/resistant, they should have sent law enforcement there instead of 2 guys who had no idea.

As the current NY State laws stand, if the squatter had been there for 30+ days, they would have to go through an eviction process to get him out.

None of this excuses his murdering of those 2 guys doing their jobs. Especially since it seems they had no idea he was there. It might have some kind of implication on the management company if they knew about the squatter, though.",20,2024-04-30 20:28:54 UTC,squatter

There's a class of property laws called ""adverse possession"" that allow people to gain rights to abandoned property after occupying by some set amount of time. And you actually have to ""unlawfully"" occupy it to obtain those rights. The idea behind it is that if a property is abandoned by the owner, that it doesn't site underutilized. But, as we see, this can cause a host of problems. Not an easy problem to solve because of the extremes either way.

You're right, the occupier can't force the landlord to let them stay there if they've been there less than 30 days. The owner can trespass that person, and have them removed if they've been there less than 30 days.

However, if the landlord is absentee and doesn't notice and the person is there for more than 30 days, then they get tenants rights and have to go through the standard eviction process. The squatter can still get removed via the eviction process. The squatter doesn't get ownership over the property. That takes 10 years of adverse possession.

I regularly report a house next to an elderly relative that is uninhabitable, has grass that is 3 feet high, has had squatters and has a mailing address in Michigan. They have sent the owner a fine but the house has been an issue for years as the owner uses a mailbox in Michigan and a series of LLCs and more mailboxes but might actually live in Israel

So probably will cost you:

* $20 for plot of land
* $16,000 for base mobile home
* $20,000 for necessary improvements (definitely will need at least a slab foundation.
* $Xk for utility hookup

Still obviously a lot cheaper than building a home from scratch.

There are more attractive prefab buildings out there.

Obviously check to ensure the plot of land you’re buying:

* Allows single family homes
* Isn’t in a historic district

Personally I think prefab homes can potential be a great way to combat the housing crisis. But most trailer homes look extreme trashy.",9,2022-06-11 21:45:29 UTC,housing crisis

I agree though I think prefab home could be an amazing way to combat the housing crisis. But it also has to be done in a responsible respectful manner.

I would love the city to release designs for several tiny home models that would be acceptable on plots zoned for both single and multi family homes.

We (the country as a whole) create an environment that traps people into cycles of homelessness and poverty and then judge and ridicule the people who have to live in it. We live in a country where there are far more empty homes than there are homeless people. I think it’s far past time for us to reevaluate the way we think about and treat these people.

How much in terms of paying out police overtime is responding to calls on people in the street or someone using in a public space?If there were more of a support system, you prevent a lot of the issues you see manifesting to begin with.

Last year, several homeless died during the Christmas blizzard, some of which refused shelter. Buffalo definitely isn’t a place you want to be outside in winter.

NYS also does a pretty good job at funding shelters, affordable housing, safety net programs and even transitional housing.

DSS Homeless Team Services,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/18m8765/dss_homeless_team_services/,2023-12-19 18:04:52 UTC,"Most of the shelters require DSS referrals. The only ones I’ve known to not were Little Portions Friary and St. Luke’s, apparently now BCM is not through DSS either. Each of these were extremely challenging to get people into, even with an advocate from an agency that worked very closely with the shelters. 

If shelters are full though, DSS has to provide shelter somewhere - often a motel. If people don’t follow through with the placement, or return to DSS for follow up, DSS will essentially blacklist the individual for a period of time and refuse to provide them shelter/services. DSS will not provide transportation, even if they place you in Amherst or Hamburg, unless you’re a family - sorry single folks, it’s wrong but it’s the way it is AFAIK (unless recent changes). 

When it’s below 32 degrees, there should be a code blue where shelters open up and are pretty much barrier free for anyone who needs a place to stay. Code blue as I knew it was accessible by showing up to the shelter, the downtown bus station, calling 211, or going to Harbor House/Restoration Society. Code Blue used to operate out of the Matt Urban Hope Center, now out of Holy Cross more recently. Unless my info is out of date - someone please correct me if I’m wrong. 

DSS has really dropped the ball serving people in crisis. Idk if they realize the population they’re serving is going through crisis, and may have multiple other crises ongoing (traumatic experiences leading to and during their homelessness, mental health, substance use, not knowing where they’ll sleep or eat next, untreated medical issues, etc). They will refuse to help people if they can find a reason, it’s terrible. God forbid someone be expressing their frustration/fear/etc during a period of crisis and trauma. Also, I know you want to help, but I will let you know that if you’re paying to put someone in a hotel and DSS learns of that they will refuse to serve them as a homeless individual because they’ll consider them housed by you. 

Agencies like Restoration Society and Matt Urban were great resources in the past, and I highly encourage anyone who may be homeless or need info to contact them. You’re likely to get helpful info and action steps, and possibly an advocate depending on your situation. Still, if you need shelter on any given night, you will need to go to DSS or call 211 after hours.

As a lifelong democrat, no I am not universally opposed to social programs.

The reality is that the OP could donate the tent and camping supplies to a local nonprofit that could make good use of it. This is not as flashy or righteous as giving it to LGBTQ homeless people. The best outcome is someone pops a tent on the sidewalk, neighbors and local businesses call police immediately because encampments are not normalized here, and the tent is thrown in the trash. Worst outcome is someone pops the tent on private property and they are verbally/physically threatened before their tent is thrown away.

You can empathize with the homeless and gladly pay taxes to support people. You don't have to allow encampments to spring up in public places. You let that fester long enough under good intentions and you turn into SF or Seattle. Look up the months long skirmishes between police and activists over clearing encampments in Cal Anderson Park in Seattle.

Buffalo isn't a wealthy or glamorous city, but people value nice, safe public spaces. If encampments ever become normalized here it's not going to be in Elmwood or Amherst, but rather the worst parts of town creating further problems.",5,2023-07-26 17:47:03 UTC,homeless

-your friend is young and i remember being that age, I strongly implore them NOT to go to any kind of shelter whether it's a warming shelter or something like the mission. People love to take advantage of you in every way physically or otherwise because they assume since you're young you're stupid, especially if you didn't grow up in the city. 

-Restoration Society is what I've used twice to find a place when I was homeless. They have a program called Rapid Rehousing where they'll pay security deposit and next couple months rent. Their wait list isn't long either especially since your friends young they'll be given priority. You can google restoration society and you'll get their phone number, they also have a Facebook page 

-at first I would sleep in parking garages under staircases and later on I purchased a tent and a good sleeping bag and moved out into the suburbs because I was tired of the shit that goes on downtown. I recommend this. MAKE SURE ITS A GOOD TENT. IT WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED EVERY SO OFTEN. 

-your friend can look up food pantries to get free food or google free lunch places. I dont remember where they are except the one that went under the library bridge.

I would advise getting there right when DSS opens to avoid the line. They should ideally have all their identifying documents because it will make the process go quicker. Also I have heard that Evergreen has an awesome Pride Center which will definitely help them. 211 will advise the best place to start; they may suggest going with Pride Center first.

Museums, nightlife, restaurants, museums, historic sites, trendy Walkable Neighborhoods, we have all that here.

There's not really much of a homeless problem. Especially compared to cities down South or out West where tent cities are common. You don't really see that here. High minimum wage, cheap rent and the climate probably helps.

**Trendy Neighborhoods**

These are the popular walkable neighborhoods with nice local commercial districts.

* Allentown - Directly North of downtown. Great if you're into nightlife. Allen Street can get pretty crazy on the weekends until 5 am.
* Elmwood Village - North of Allentown. Lots of young professionals and students, but a little quieter than Allentown
* North Buffalo - anything North of Delaware Park. Hertel is probably the best commercial street in the city in terms of variety of shops, restaurants and bars.

**Up and coming areas**

These places are still rough around the edges, but have seen a lot of development in the past decade. Generally speaking it looks sketchier than it actually is.

* Blackrock - North of Buffalo State. Lots of new breweries, lofts and startup space. Plus the only Wegmans in the city proper.
* Westside - Anything West of Richmond. Lots of nice mini commercial districts with plenty of hidden gems in terms of shops, cafes and restaurants. Connecticut Street and Rhode Island Street are solid. Niagara and Grant streets are improving. Also a lot of great new wave ethnic cuisine. Definitely check out the Westside Bazaar.
* First Ward - I covered this below.
* Larkin - 1 mile East of Downtown. This is a warehouse district you wouldn't believe was completely abandoned 15 years ago. Now it acts as a second CBD and lately there's been more focus on apartments and everyday amenities. Check out Food Truck Tuesdays!

Obviously, there's also your standard suburban sprawl, though there are some nicer semi-walkable villages too.",3,2020-04-14 22:09:36 UTC,homeless

* Buffalo has been slowly implementing its complete streets plan. It takes a long time to get to every street, especially the ones with high traffic volume that require additional studies and funding 
* Expansion is entirely up to the FTA at the moment and the NFTA will propose several additional BRT lines as part of their new Master Plan due in 2025
* There’s actually a record amount of subsidized housing being built right now including completely rebuilding both Perry Projects and Marine Drive
* Homeless shelters only mask the symptoms, they aren’t a long term solution. We need more affordable housing, transitional housing and more long term care facilities
* The city/state has done a great job at attracting non-rusty jobs to the city. From medium sized tech companies to startups and from film industry jobs to light manufacturing

At the end of the day it all comes down to funding. The city only has so much money and there’s only so many federal and state grants.

There’s some things the city could do with the state permission to make things a little better:

* Land Use Tax - A modest land use tax could generate as much as $20 million per year
* Reinstate Tolls on the 190 - a $1 toll could raise $30 million per year

That’s $50 million to work with.

Unfortunately, that’s still not a TON of money. That’s enough to build 3 miles of new streetscapes with BRT, OR 280 units of affordable housing.

Of course over 10 years that can really add up, but it’s still going to take decades and that still doesn’t cover the immense cost of say long term care facilities for addiction and mental healthcare.

Buffalo probably needs:

* $2 billion to modernize the streetscape of every major street with bike and bus infrastructure and BRT facilities. 
* $5 billion to build 25,000 new affordable housing units to meet current demand 
* $1 billion to build several long term care facilities and fund them for 10 years
* $500 million to build 2,000 units of transitional housing",-1,2024-08-04 22:30:49 UTC,"homeless, affordable housing"

Doing this helps you and you alone.  The staff, the transient, and the police want nothing to do with the situation you are creating.  Unless the individual in question is being harassing (and asking for a dollar is not harassing) there is absolutely no need to get the police involved - legality of panhandling aside.

Once a person enters a life of homelessness (which believe it or not isn't something people just choose to do one day) it is extremely difficult to get out of it.  This is because our society abuses and brushes away these unfortunate people rather than provide the tools and path necessary to rejoin the community as a productive member.  Hostile architecture, abusive targeted laws, and a broken rehabilitation/transitional system are truly kicking you when you're homeless.

That being said, if someone on the streets has managed to scrap together a few bucks and wants to toss one of those on a lotto ticket on the chance that they will win and escape their current reality, is that such a bad thing?  I mean, as I’ve pointed out, there’s almost no chance that they’ll win, but if that’s what they want to spend a portion of their money on because that absurdly low chance gives them hope, how is it hurting me or the people who gave him or her a dollar or two?

Do you think that they are not going to spend some of their earnings on food just because they also bought a lottery ticket?  That they are going to completely forgo a basic biological need?  Or do you believe that these people are “scamming” the public pretending that they don’t have need money for food and by offering up a buck you are merely paying for someone’s lotto tickets?

Before you point out that there are services and housing available for the homeless, understand that these are all available in limited amounts.  When the food or beds run out, that’s it.  You’re told, “I’m sorry, better luck tomorrow” and you’re put out on the streets to fend for yourself.

Even those who have been able to secure a place to sleep off the streets for the night and have managed to find a bite to eat for the day will find themselves scavenging for a buck here and there.  Why not?  Isn’t that what we all do?  Try to make more than the bare minimum?  And as someone in that situation, if you’re going to use your “excess” money to buy a lottery ticket is it in your best interest to say that to a person walking by?

Hell, I don’t even care if the actual dollar I give away goes to booze if that’s what it takes to make your life a little more bearable.  Fuck me if I’m to tell you how to spend your money.  My only hope is that you’re doing your best to get by and take care of yourself.

Sadly, many people we refer to as “homeless” are well aware of the fact that most people on the street will only donate when it is under the context of feeding them.  So that’s the story they tell.  Honestly, would you give a buck to someone who has been living on the street for a year if they told you they were going to use that buck to buy a lotto ticket in the hope that they could escape poverty or to buy a beer because it helps them enjoy life for a brief moment in an otherwise miserable reality?

Probably not.

Yet, as poor as those decisions are, can you really blame them?

And given that you wouldn’t provide a dollar to them if they were being honest, can you blame them for claiming that every dollar goes to paying for food?

Rather than hating on these people, why don’t you really put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself what would you do in the face of such odds?",1,2016-05-04 02:42:03 UTC,homeless

Rod Watson: Buffalo students play catch-up to New York City’s homeless,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/7lbsh3/rod_watson_buffalo_students_play_catchup_to_new/,2017-12-21 19:30:59 UTC,"TEXT:

For almost as long as there have been schools, educators have pointed to a student’s socioeconomic background as the greatest determinant of – or excuse for – why some succeed and others don’t.

It’s an explanation that makes last week’s report from The Education Trust-New York all the more puzzling – and damning.

How could homeless kids in New York City – bouncing from shelter to shelter or living out of a car – do as well or better on average than Buffalo Public Schools students who never have been homeless?

Granted, Buffalo’s kids as a whole are a little bit poorer than New York City’s. State data pegs 79 percent of Buffalo’s students as economically disadvantaged, compared to 71 percent in New York City. Nor is Buffalo alone in underperforming compared to homeless kids downstate. Rochester and Syracuse fared much worse in the comparison.

But the 8 point gap in poverty is not enough to explain the test score disparity, and the fact that other districts are doing even worse doesn’t excuse Buffalo’s poor performance.

According to the report, 21 percent of New York City’s homeless kids and 41 percent of students who had never been homeless passed the state’s 2015-16 English exam. That compares to 10 percent of Buffalo’s homeless pupils, and just 18 percent of Buffalo students who were never homeless. In math, 19 percent of New York City’s homeless and 40 percent of its never-homeless students passed, compared to just 7 percent of Buffalo’s homeless and 18 percent of its never homeless kids.

One explanation is that New York City has put a big emphasis on educating its homeless population, said Abja Midha, deputy director of The Education Trust-New York. That emphasis includes ""intense tracking of students from a young age,"" starting in kindergarten and first grade and not waiting until state tests begin in third grade, she said.

And it means providing social and academic support, such as encouraging kids to do homework in after-school programs where it’s quieter than in a homeless shelter.

New York City also has focused on community schools that stay open nights and weekends and provide extra services.

""In Buffalo, the community schools initiative is relatively new,"" she said by way of contrast.

In fact, it didn’t arrive until Superintendent Kriner Cash was hired in 2015. That was long after Michael Bloomberg took control of New York City’s schools while mayor. Samuel L. Radford III, president of the District Parent Coordinating Council – one of the partners in the report – noted that much of New York City’s improvement came during Bloomberg’s tenure.

What was Buffalo doing during that time?

Arguing over who should or shouldn’t be superintendent and hemming and hawing over mayoral control.

Now Cash points to mental health supports in schools, universal prekindergarten and smaller class sizes as well as community schools – with their after-school and Saturday programming – as part of the effort to put ""a huge bear hug around all of our students."" He also cites Say Yes Buffalo’s wraparound services.

Those are the supports vulnerable kids need regardless of where they live.

""My thing is to help all of our children; that’s what we’re trying to do,"" Cash said.

That New York City was on to that long before Buffalo doesn’t say much for those in charge here before Cash’s arrival.

In other words, leadership matters. Without it, kids pay dearly.",1,2017-12-21 19:31:46 UTC,homeless

It has been proven that poverty and crime are interlinked; by addressing issues of extreme and drastic poverty; you significantly reduce crime.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7234816/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7234816/)

This has been proven. I will throw endless research documents down. Simple sociology 101 that you learn in college; or even high school if you graduated.

When Giuliani did this; he addressed crime; not by putting a police officer on every corner. If anything, they didn't help. Before he was even mayor, Thompkins Square. Further more; actually; 1992 was a massive riot where 1,000 off-duty police officers rioted against the creation of a civilian-lead consul for police oversight. So yeah, why not add more police officers to that?

Further more; police cost about 1.22 million for each officer; including their equipment, training; etc. Each new police officer reduces crime about 0.6 percent or drops homicides specifically by 1%. This is over districts. Provincial regions/municipalities within the city. In order to actually reduce crime; you would need to hire hundreds of officers. Blow through hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars that we simply don't have.

[https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2021/04/20/988769793/when-you-add-more-police-to-a-city-what-happens](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2021/04/20/988769793/when-you-add-more-police-to-a-city-what-happens)

Instead. We could take that money and reduce poverty. Direct aid, mutual aid; city-block spanning centers to feed and supply the growing lower class of NYC. The point of defunding is to stop hiring armed mercenaries to enforce the interests of the state, but rather make specific forces and institutions to combat unique cases of poverty and desolation in many communities that have been subjected to systematic exploitation or suffered the darker side of global trade. Civilian-led institutions with complete democratic accountability, for each community and region as needed. 

But nah. Police officers. ***Because you know; people won't end up at downtown, ramming trucks through police barricades, trying to set city hall on fire and throwing bricks. Of course the police around here wouldn't ever crack an innocent old man's skull on the pavement and leave him bleeding out while preventing paramedics from approaching!***

Meaning half of households in the region can afford these apartments.

In short, the region isn’t as poor as most people think.

Probably most likely:

* Young Professionals who work in finance, biomed, professional services or tech with salaries over $50,000
* Couples with no kids (with a partner you actually don’t even have to be working much over minimum wage to afford these)
* Remote workers with out-of-state salaries
* With roommates you can still afford these if you make $20 an hour or more

Also, these are extremely cheap compared to those cities that you listed. Especially downtown where rents average:

* $4,000 in Manhattan 
* $3,600 in downtown San Francisco
* $2,200 in downtown Seattle

It’s not that these apartments are expensive, it’s that Buffalo’s real estate has been extremely underpriced for decades and now are correcting themselves now that the city is seeing real growth again.

That’s ok though, we should be building as many “luxury” apartments as possible. Not only does this increase supply helping to tame price increases elsewhere in the city, the much needed tax revenue can be used to build more affordable housing units.

Also, most new projects have included some below market rate units. 201 Ellicott is filled entirely with below market rate apartments for example. They’re adding more units at McCarly Gardens and Pilgrim Village. Wouldn’t be surprised if the added units at Marine Drive next door to Canalside too which is poised to undergo a massive renovation.",6,2021-09-28 12:41:59 UTC,affordable housing

They are asking for help and there is nothing wrong with helping them, even if they spend 100% on drugs.

There is also nothing wrong with not helping them if you can’t afford it or just don’t want to.

Whether or not they are “fake” should be the last thing you are thinking. You should be asking yourself “will this $5 or $10 impact me the same way it will impact this person? Is it even close?” If they answer is no, give it away knowing you have made someone else’s day much better without really affecting your own, even if it is just to pick up a dime bag. Maybe you stopped them from prostituting themselves for drugs. Maybe you stopped them from stealing for drugs. Maybe you made them believe in people again. Or hopefully you gave them their one meal for the day. No matter how they spend it, you know you helped them on one way or another.

Then warm store bought roast beef in au jus, slice the roll in half, pile the roast beef on the bottom, barely dip the top into the au jus, and eat.

Apparently they haven't rented an apartment or room in EV or Allen in awhile. If they did they would know at those prices you usually only get a craphole.

Jobs here are great if you know people, if you social network you can make money in this town. If you are secluded and keep to yourself chances are you will only make min wage or just above.

There is a huge income disparity in Buffalo(the city not burbs).
I have found myself homeless here twice in recent years. 

Once because of a job that closed (Collections). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

(Disclaimer: Being white and educated doesn't mean you aren't poor, a lot of people are educated here and job competition is vicious.)
I am white.
I have a 2 year degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, Buffalo can be a great city to live in.
But the downsides are the nepotism, cold, income disparity, high rental prices, lack of reasonable bus system(that arrives on time or to the suburbs), jobs(blue collar/non-union).

Oh, and if you have any issues with credit good luck renting anywhere corporate. I was a unlucky individual with a awesome mother who used my info for utilities and other bills that makes renting that way near impossible.

preparing to move,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/5drth2/preparing_to_move/,2016-11-19 09:51:04 UTC,"Buffalo is actually on the verge of eradicating chronic homelessness. The climate is cold, so there's a bit less truly homeless.

23% of families live below the poverty line and there are definitely run down parts of town where you'd find drug paraphernalia. However, you probably won't be hanging out in these areas.

Being in New York, many residents are able to benefit from more generous welfare. While the minimum wage us $9 an hour, if you work part time or are a single parent, you'll likely qualify for some assistance.

As for young professionals: Bio-med, Finance, Engineeting Tech, Marketing and Law offer a lot of high paying jobs for college grads. There's also a lot of call centers that pay a bit higher than minimum wage. 

As long as the national trend continues towards urbanism, I don't see this trend ending anytime soon. Young people for the most part don't want to live in bland soulless suburbs.

You will probably encounter a homeless person or two though, but that is the worse of it.

Its only a 20 minute walk from the Terminal to Babeville.

If you are looking for something to do before the show, checkout the free observation deck atop of City Hall, which is actually the 3rd tallest in the US. 

Hallwalls Contemporary Art Gallery is also worth checking out and is actually part of the Babeville complex.

Also, the Naval Park should be opened by then which is pretty cool if you are into WWII history and ships.

After the show, you are just a block North of Chippewa which is Buffalo's clubbing scene.

Alternatively, you are just a few blocks from Allen Street where you can find cheap hipster dives, indie music venues and a few upscale places.

Between the two scenes are quite a few bars scattered about.

Last call is at 4 am. Afterwards you can hit up Jim's Steak out or Towne Restaurant until they close at 5 am. Then you can just walk back to the station and grab some Tim Horton's.

There is also the 24 hour Seneca Creek Casino you can hang out at, though its just far enough the I would take a cab.

Also, the Metrorail is free to ride downtown above ground which might be useful if you wanted to go down to the waterfront and back. ",19,2015-03-05 06:54:19 UTC,homeless

Buffalo is Segregation City,132,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/usbt2y/buffalo_is_segregation_city/,2022-05-18 12:31:40 UTC,"This is a good point. I'm not sure if you're using this as an argument that people WANT segregation, or if you're just pointing out something you've seen, but the idea of gentrification brings attention to how out-of-balance things are. 

Gentrification is fucking awesome to people who own property, right? Like - if I bought a home for $40k and suddenly that neighborhood became the place to be, I'd be pumped to earn over 1000% on my investment over a few years. 

But let's face it: **Gentrification is happening in places where the people living there do NOT own property.** They're tenants renting someone else's property. The ""kind"" landlords will raise rent to merely catch up with tax assessments and basic inflation, the rest of them will go ""the market value has changed"" (I put ""kind"" in quotes because very, very, very few landlords are anything but exploitative). 

***

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than BIPOC. Everything from slavery to Jim Crow to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many BIPOC. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit BIPOC may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're BIPOC from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that way because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard BBQ.
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among BIPOC, those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the place they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",45,2022-05-18 14:07:21 UTC,affordable housing

2. Union organizer - I get why some people are impressed by this, personally I think it's a bit of a detriment for a mayor. This is the person who will be negotiating on behalf of the tax payers with the various public unions it works with

3. Nurse - tough job, sure. Don't think it means you're qualified for mayor

4. Head of FBCLT - FBCLT has built 2 affordable units in conjunction with H4H. Their master plan, to build 50 units of affordable housing, still doesn't have the funding needed to move forward. Had she stuck around at FBCLT to see the master plan through to success and maybe get a couple other plans going, then it would have been a big selling point. As is, when you dig into what she accomplished here, from the context of showing she's qualified to be mayor, it's all fizz and no beer

Apartments also give good quality of life(see Germany, Vienna, Japan, Taiwan, Chinese mega-cities, NYC-if you can afford them, Amsterdam, Toronto-if you afford them, the one part of Houston that isn't a sprawled out middle finger to the climate), and if every area is zoned for high density, then developers won't concentrate the high density developments in one area, and there can be space for smaller developers. Things like updating fire code to allow for single stairwell buildings can also improve the quality of the apartments, and build small apartments that are similar to the existing neighborhood. 

Also missing middle housing is the housing types in between single family home and condo tower (duplex, triplex, 4plex, small walkup apt buildings, townhomes, row houses, bungalow courts, and more).

The city could craft a program to sell give away the lots to individuals who agree to occupy them, provide cheap financing, partner with UB's School of Architecture to design affordable attractive housing, and have local contractors build them. These houses can still be dense (1-3 units per narrow lot) but I think owner occupancy is important. Good design is important too, fortunately, there are ways to build attractive smaller units that don't look like garbage by using more innovative building materials and modular components.

To that extent, you could also provide incentives for startups to redevelop abandoned industrial properties as office/working space to get economic activity/opportunity in the area. Imagine if in addition to 43North providing financial incentives to relocation, they also provided financial incentives to develop new office space in currently abandoned properties, which would further anchor startups in Buffalo.

Unfortunately, I think that politically there's been a push to 'develop' east of Main with the garbage you pointed out - lots of siding, poor use of setbacks, etc., because it's cheap and developers aren't really willing to pour money into lower income housing.

1) Market rate new construction often occurs *after* housing prices have climbed. The subsequent “drop” in prices in the surrounding area are almost fractions of a percentage, and never back to pre-climb prices, and most often this has been studied in much larger cities (New York, San Fran) while cities more similar to Buffalo (Minneapolis) actually saw an *increase correlation to new construction.

2) They specifically state the solution is *affordable housing* in neighborhoods like Elmwood, because the market rate housing does not significantly lower prices. Statistically sure, but from a lifestyle perspective, an overall 1% decrease in rent in surrounding new construction is not meaningful. 

3) Gentrification is still happening, and not just because the previous residents “die” or find more affordable housing, but because suddenly when they walk down the street they’ve lived on for years, they get dirty looks, or have the cops called on them, or are followed in stores that opened in *their* neighborhood. A demographic change can have just as much of a forced displacement effect as policy or literal demo/replacement.

To solve increased housing prices in the West Side, Elmwood, and Buffalo, there needs to be new construction sure, but there also needs to be an effort by the city to densify and improve *other* neighborhoods as well. Downtown has dozens of block-size parking lots where this development should occur; the East Side was so thoroughly firebombed by the Brown Administration that there’s few “centers” left, but they should focus development around existing nodes. Preservationists, who many in this thread say are obstructing progress, have helped some of the best added density in many neighborhoods, pushing for the reuse of old schools and factories, affordable and market rate— more of that, and more enforcement by the city to get historic properties out of the hands of out of town speculators and into the hands of people who want to actually do shit.",3,2022-02-15 15:37:27 UTC,affordable housing

That's not related to the claim you just made, though, which is that any attempt to control the price of housing other than simply allowing the ""free market"" to choose results in higher prices for the general population. I think if you made your claim more specific (like saying that means-tested affordable housing developments detract from the overall housing supply and therefore increase prices for others) it might be fair, but since there are so many different ways of controlling the price of housing its essentially meaningless. In general, programs aimed at correcting only the absolute worst manifestations of the housing crisis have very little impact on people who aren't quite as desperate, but who are still burdened. Programs that don't make any attempt at all to target specific inequalities (like just letting the free market run wild with housing prices, as you're suggesting) at best don't have any impact on the lives of the *most* desperate.

That's why action on housing needs to target *the entire housing market*, and that means actively disrupting the monopoly that landlords and developers have on housing. Policies like rent control, increased tenant protections, *un-means tested* socialized housing, etc. would all work to decrease the price of housing for everyone.

I think /u/Eudaimonics has the most accurate statement.

On one hand, they are providing more apartments, so it could drop the area unit / house rates. If this happened, this would be a good natural adjustment, and this new building can either struggle to fill, or drop price. I am a landlord (owner occupied, but a taste for the concept), and I respect people need to live in a home, but I charge fair area rates, not what I can to get by. If they price them competitively, which happens to be in the more generally affordable territory, they are going to be swept up very fast being brand new, updated, prime location, and usually these buildings also offer 'community benefits' (pool / gym / discounts at retail).

I'd argue this is the price of 'new' and the more appropriate battles might be for either used buildings or appearance. Maybe force them to do something interesting community wise, to tie them into benefiting it. I don't have any ideas, but that makes more sense than arguing what they want to charge to me.

If you aren't satisfied with the price, can't consumers voice with their dollars?

Leaders of the left-leaning Working Families Party say that the protests influenced their deliberations this week as they bypassed Democratic incumbent Byron W. Brown and endorsed activist India Walton for mayor.

""It comes from the Black Lives Matter movement, from the death of George Floyd and the situation with the police officers in Rochester,"" said Western New York Working Families member Dave Chudy, referring to galvanizing events of the summer protests.

""As founding executive director of the Fruit Belt Community Land Trust, India showed a remarkable vision for delivering affordable housing – and the leadership skills to deliver the outcomes that working people need,"" said state Working Families Party Director Sochie Nnaemeka. ""As a single mother, a NICU nurse, and a seasoned organizer, India has always grounded her leadership in care and justice for all. We're ready to get to work to elect her as the next mayor of Buffalo.""

Walton reacted by noting that her platform and values ""are closely aligned in putting justice for working people first.""

""This endorsement proves that the people of Buffalo are ready for real progressive leadership,"" Walton said. ""I'm ready to work alongside the WFP to help deliver that.""

Brown will seek the endorsement of the Democratic Party on Thursday, confirming the long-held open secret that his campaign seeks to break the current four-term record he shares with the late James D. Griffin.

Now Brown faces not only a June primary from Walton and the left wing of his own Democratic Party, but also her general election challenge in November on the Working Families line. Brown, with his powerful political organization and fundraising capabilities (not to mention all the advantages of incumbency), is still considered the overwhelming favorite in both contests.

But the mayor's effort to gain an unprecedented fifth term now faces a more than token challenge capable of attracting left wing votes. And while no major elected officials or business leaders appear to recognize significant vulnerabilities in Brown and challenge him this year, he must guard against any surprise challenge from the left in a time when similar forces are gaining more and more strength around the nation.

Indeed, the mayor recognized that in his re-election announcement remarks to The Buffalo News earlier this week.

""I take nothing for granted,"" he said.

In a Wednesday statement, spokesman Michael J. DeGeorge reiterated the mayor's sentiments when asked to react to the Walton endorsement, though he did not address questions about the failure to again gain Working Families backing.

""Mayor Brown will work hard to earn the support of every City of Buffalo resident,"" DeGeorge said, ""and ask them to continue to put their faith in his leadership during these challenging times for four more years.""

The friction in the last year and a half contrasts with the historically placid relationship Brown has had with the legislative branch during much of his 15 years as mayor.

Erie County Democratic Chairman Jeremy J. Zellner said that he does not anticipate major problems from Walton.

""I don't see it as having an effect on that race at all,"" he said.

Still, Working Families has backed Brown in every election since its start in 1998, and it seemed natural that it would grant him the line he requested again this year. But Chudy said his minor party is considering new concerns among its younger members.

""We see this as generational among people who think things need to happen quicker,"" he said.

And Walton impressed Working Families officials enough to gain their nod. Chudy said that they noted Walton's ""push back"" against gentrification in the city's Fruit Belt neighborhood.

""That seemed to galvanize a lot of younger people who are not participating in politics,"" he said, ""and we are a bottom-up party.""

Do you think it’s population is at the perfect size, the economy is perfectly healthy, and the rent is exactly where it should be? If so that is just sad. 

Buffalo is one of the most affordable cities in the entire country. It also happens to be one of the most economically depressed, impoverished, crime ridden, and undereducated cities in the entire country. There is a reason rent is so cheap, in the last 50 years nobody wanted to live here. The city is finally seeing real investment after decades of neglect and people like you kick and scream to keep it exactly as is.  Additional luxury buildings and higher rents mean more tax revenue for the city, more investment in infrastructure, and more new developments (not to mention better schools, civic services, and improved healthcare). 

If you are a renter, you have no right to live in your apartment at a given price for any longer than the term of your lease. Period. I’m sorry if this hurts your feelings. Most Buffalonians are lucky to live where they do at the rents they pay right now. 

People like you who scream about “gentrification” and renters getting “pushed out” of their homes just do not see the big picture, and it’s bad for the city, because you’re hindering progress and making it a nightmare for developers to invest in Buffalo. A rising tide lifts all boats. Yes, some people will no longer be able to afford their apartment, they will spill over into more affordable neighborhoods. 

You’re also forgetting about the thousands of people who own their homes and will enjoy large returns on their investments when they sell, or have the ability to take out equity in their house for capital improvements. This is happening in practically every neighborhood (see the West Side). 

What you need to come to terms with is that Buffalo cannot simultaneously become a more desirable place to live and also preserve the unbelievably low cost of living that people have gotten used to. 

If Buffalo ever came even close to being “too expensive”, then that is a reason to celebrate because it would mean that the city truly turned a corner after over 50 years of decline and neglect. But the reality is that Buffalo is not even remotely close to that point, so we should welcome higher rents, new developments, and outside investment, because it means we’re making progress. Buffalo is not Boston or New York, we are at no risk of running out of affordable housing. 

Unless you’re ok with Buffalo NY turning into Gary, Indiana, you need to accept that higher rent and new development is the price we will pay to put some meat on our skeleton of a city.

Um...no. They're ""anti development"" because they don't want their neighborhood getting torn asunder for no reason except to line a developer's pockets. The ""out of character"" comments refer to building these giant skyscrapers around the corner from a street filled with homes. Furthermore, the ""affordable housing"" complaints usually come from not from the Green Code/Preseration people, but the developers themselves. There was even a Buffalo News ""guest editorial"" not too long ago from a couple of big-money developers saying that forcing affordable units in new construction would only harm Buffalo's growth. (Wait, so guaranteeing that people have a chance of quality housing regardless of income is a BAD thing? TIL). Nearly every Green Code/Preservation advocate I've talked to is not only for affordable housing, but wants it in law that separate units be set aside in new builds for that purpose. Meanwhile I've seen many more development zealots either shoot down the affordable housing law, or at least want it built away from the ""hot"" neighborhoods.

>There are literally three people (Gretchen Circone, Catherine Faust, Dan Sack) who are desperately fighting to keep Elmwood a white upper class bastion. No three people have done more to destroy a neighborhood / city anywhere in the country than they have to Elmwood / Buffalo. Just look at the absolute dichotomy between Elmwood and Hertel. Ten years ago Elmwood was actually pretty nice and Hertel was a total shithole. Then a bunch of Millennials and intelligent business owners moved into North Buffalo and there was development with relatively deminimus resistance to the development. The situation has now totally changed, with Hertel as a dynamic, growing neighborhood and scores of empty restaurants and commercial space on Elmwood. Literally caused by three hateful, ignorant people.

First, let's stop hyperbolizing the Hertel resurgence. It may not have been ""the"" destination 10 years ago, but by no means was it a ""shithole"" or has made a momentous comeback from being a veritable war zone like Grant Street. It had plenty of long-time businesses and establishments. It was still a desirable neighborhood for young couples to live until Junior was old enough for school, in which they headed for suburbs. (I know this because I know people who admitted they did just that. Not for racial differences, but because of the Buffalo School system). Yes it is more popular now, but spare me the whole heroic rags-to-riches narrative. And the empty storefronts on Elmwood? Not caused by the people you mention. Caused by the many absentee landlords who own(ed) buildings on the strip. The most promintent being Roger Chainani, notorious for overcharging rents and neglecting his properties. These among other buildings were always the chronically empty, until recently when Sinatra bought him out.

>The idea that that there were many (if any) commentators openly hoping for any commercial establishments to shut down is laughable. Pretty much every new opening was celebrated and closures were seen as bad things. It has been repeatedly pointed out the closures are a direct result of Gretchen, Catherine and Dan's actions to retard Elmwood development, which is perhaps where your anger is coming from.

Read the article about MTK Kitchen, prime example of it right there.

Better Look: Salvation Army Hope on Main,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/tksggt/better_look_salvation_army_hope_on_main/,2022-03-23 12:07:42 UTC,"OK, rant incoming. 

**TL;DR the current low income housing tax credit is an investor and bank giveaway, we'd be better served by directly investing in real public housing**

The density of this project is good, but it highlights the insanity of the 80's Regan-era Low Income Housing Tax Credit (aka LIHTC) and privatization of public housing, to what is a massive handout to developers and their investors.

The article in the Buffalo News about this project labels this an $86 million dollar project with 246 units, $16 million and 80 units in the emergency homeless shelter which is paid for by the state. 

Emergency shelter aside, that leaves the affordable housing component at 163 units for $70 million. Buffalo Business First had originally reported the cost at $15 million (which is a little revealing if you ask me).

That leaves us at a cost per unit at $430,000. 

Let's look at a comparison nearby. The Grid apartments a few blocks away, similar style, format and materials was reported to cost $35 million for 215 market rate units and commercial space. Cost per unit, $162,000.

Seems steep right? How did an affordable housing project jump from costing $15 mil to $70 mil, at nearly three times the rate of comparable market units? Are the units going to really cost that much more than market rate housing?

How does the LIHTC work?

The developer of the project, if meeting income limits on the units, can automatically claim credits of 4% of the qualified basis of the project per year, for 10 years. (qualified basis = essentially total development and construction cost of the building). The state can direct additional to raise this to 9%. If the project is in a qualified census tract, it gets boosted to 130% of that. Finally, the tax credits are non-refundable, but transferable. Which means they must be used to offset income in the same year, but can be transferred to investors to offset taxes they would normally pay on income and investments.

So what does that mean? It means the developers have every incentive to inflate the cost basis of their project. Why? Because the larger the cost, the bigger the tax credit, the more tax credits can essentially be sold to banks and investment funds. 

All said, on development costs alone at $70 million, **this project will generate roughly somewhere from $28 - $82 million in tax credits to be largely sold or transferred.** I'd love to be wrong on this, so if I am offbase please correct me.

The tax credit ends up being a round-about handout to banks and investors with a small number of affordable units as a side effect. We'd be much better served by the state or federal government building affordable units themselves or allocating fixed per-unit grants, than allowing this free-for-all.

To me, this is a big reason for the ""missing middle"" of new affordable middle-class housing.",8,2022-03-23 16:16:29 UTC,"homeless, affordable housing"

Solely to make more money or ""break even""? That's not the fault of poor people trying to get a decent apartment, that's based on developers being greedy. Development is going fine in Buffalo as long as you aren't poor. The west side is gentrifying, along with several other parts of the city. Yeah that's good for the tax base but it also means the poor people (and refugees on the west side) who have had to live in those previously shitty areas for years are pushed out because they can't afford the rent costs. You have to try and make some accommodations for everyone which is what this plan is attempting to do. If developers weren't completely focused on greed then these places would have 1/3 of the apartments for low income people and then have a range of costs between the rest. That helps to stop the cycle of poor people being pushed into the next terrible part of the city.


I think the 1 out of 3 number is to high, but they're trying to make a point that housing needs to exist for lower income people. Most housing they can afford is terribly insulated and falling apart. The idea here is that developers coming in will have to work with the community and groups like push to ensure their is affordable housing instead of allowing them to just build super nice lofts and shit and jack up the rent prices. That's when gentrification happens and that's when the poor people who oftentimes have been there for awhile get pushed out.

I don't think the goal is to screw over middle income earners in favor of low income earners, it's to provide some influence and power for the poor people nobody cares about (read the comment below yours). It's not a handout to have a livable apartment, it's a right. Im in the same boat as you money-wise and it sucks that we don't have a ton of great options, but I don't think that means that poor people shouldn't have any options.

Edit: I'm not trying to sound aggressive or accusatory so I'm sorry if it reads that way. It just makes zero sense to me that we always blame the people who have no money and no power for problems when we could point the finger at the super wealthy developers who don't really care at all about us.",-1,2016-05-05 13:47:46 UTC,affordable housing

When you isolate poverty, it feeds into itself.

This is one market reality.  But it seems to ignore another in that without strong market rate and high end housing the tax base is hurt.  Which in turn stunts the growth of the city and takes away the ability to provide services to the poor.  

It also says nothing to the entitlement factor that poor are not entitled to **new** housing.  The focus should be on quality/livable housing.  They are not the same.  

> Maybe one out of 5 would be easier? Maybe throw in some tax incentives to make this voluntary?

It should be closer to 5% rather than 10% IMHO.  Incentives of some kind should also be required...but orgs like PUSH don't bother with these details.  That's probably the most concerning thing.  PUSH just wants the city to require stuff 'just because' and 'poor people' but that's not how the world works.  

I like the idea of a cash payment fund affordable housing **if** the developer does not want to include affordable housing in their project.  But in order for the city to 'wet their beak' on this they need to offer something in return.  Maybe improving or fast tracking a project that in turn saves the developer an equal about of the ~~bribe~~ affordable housing contribution?  

Like it or not, developers need to make a return on their investment.  If they target a specific demographic for lease or sale they should be free to target this class without restrictions.  ",6,2016-05-05 17:03:15 UTC,affordable housing

Just need to do some reskinning with a modern facade.

Of course, it would be cheaper.  But Buffalo does not need any more poorly designed 'cheap' affordable housing.  Design goes beyond what the facade looks like.  The layout of this housing complex is poor.  The layout inside of the buildings is poor.  It would be difficult, if not impossible, to make these buildings mixed use w/o demolishing them anyways.  

What it needs are better neighborhoods.  What the city needs are modern walkable neighborhoods and that's only possible with mixed use.  Affordable housing also needs to be in walkable neighborhoods as that removes a dependence on transportation which rolls down to changing the income dynamic for residents, which in turn, helps upward mobility.  

Changing these 41 acres to include retail and commercial rather than just reskinning is what can unlock opportunity for those who live there rather than just wasting millions on putting lipstick on a pig.  

My personal take is the reason why Higgins wants to reskin is it's a lot easier to hand out payback contracts to donors when it's a rehab rather than needing developers to run the project.

>This year's Code Blue Shelters are located at Harbor House at 241 Genesee Street and Holy Cross at 412 Niagara Street in Buffalo, as well as at the Rural Outreach Center Transitional Housing (ROC) in East Aurora serving the southern part of Erie County. Call 716-222-4020 for information on the ROC location or if you need a ride. Daytime warming centers at 586 Genesee and the ROC are also open when daytime temperature or windchill reaches 32 degrees or lower. If you see or know of someone who needs shelter during cold weather, call 211.

A home doesn’t have to be a stable structure, it can be a specific city or even a feeling…one can find a sense of home with people, on the open road, etc. and some unhoused people are offended by the implication that they have no home when they’re referred to as homeless. “Unhoused,” on the other hand, indicates the person doesn’t have a physical residence at which they reside - a literal structure. The word homeless also has such a negative stigma attached to it. Language matters.",11,2022-12-23 05:04:37 UTC,"homeless, unhoused"
