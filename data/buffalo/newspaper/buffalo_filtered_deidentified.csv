buffalo,2022-05-20T00:00:00Z,Atlantic Online,The Buffalo News,soup kitchen,[ORGANIZATION] Being Black in [ORGANIZATION],"[ORGANIZATION] went to [ORGANIZATION] grocery store on [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] to purchase the ingredients for her strawberry shortcake. Im picturing how [ORGANIZATION] must have intended to take her little cakes out of the refrigerator on [LOCATION] after attending [PERSON]. Im picturing this grandmother closing her eyes and swaying her head as she bites into her cake. Moments feel like [TIME] as she swallows. [PERSON] suspends time-especially strawberry-shortcake bliss.On [ORGANIZATION], though, [ORGANIZATION] was one of 10 people whom an DATE2 white supremacist allegedly murdered with an assault rifle. She survived the lethality of racist policy survived breast cancer like my mother and partner, at a time when Black women are the most likely to die of that disease. But [ORGANIZATION] wasnt able to survive racist violence. For Black people to survive both racist policy and racist violence is grueling. To live as a Black [ORGANIZATION]n is to be a survivor.[PERSON] isnt ready to truly understand the [PERSON] shooting[ORGANIZATION]s killer denied all this. Racist theories deny the racist structure of [ORGANIZATION]n policies, the ubiquity of racist violence, and the obvious and ongoing structural violence revealed by racial disparities. The heartbeat of being racist is denial. The deeper the denial, the more diabolical the racist theory.The most diabolical of all racist ideas operating [ORGANIZATION]-the theory reaching the very depths of denialism, the theory that replaces reality perhaps more than any other-is the [ORGANIZATION] theory, or [ORGANIZATION], a white-supremacist conspiracy theory cited in a screed linked to the [PERSON] shooter. But versions of [ORGANIZATION] have also been spread by [ORGANIZATION], PERSON4, and many other powerful political and media figures in GPE2 [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] denies the greatest white privilege life itself. It denies the greatest Black deprivation life itself.[ORGANIZATION] theorists believe that Democrats, liberals, progressives, immigrants, Black people, Asians, Latino people, Muslims, abortionists, and Jews are trying to replace the native-born and original white populations in their countries. No longer would I just accept our replacement, the author of the [PERSON] screed said. No longer would I just accept our genocide. No longer will I willingly serve the people who are trying to end me and my race. I would have to take the fight to the replacers myself.What group did the [PERSON] shooter choose to target? He selected an obvious, visible, and large group of replacers. He chose Black people, he explained, because all black people are replacers just by existing in [LOCATION] countries.Imagine how much a white supremacist has to replace reality in order to believe that white people-who remain on the higher end of nearly every racial disparity-are being killed off, that they are being replaced, that they are being harmed, and that to protect themselves, they need to attack the very Black people who are actually on the lower end of nearly every racial disparity. The [ORGANIZATION] theory wholly replaces reality, presenting the dying as the living, and the living as the dying.Black people are more likely than white people to die in pregnancy, before their first birthdays, and from heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, strokes, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease, and [ORGANIZATION] of the 10 leading causes of death in GPE2.From [PERSON], the overall life expectancy in GPE2 fell by [PERSON], the steepest decline since World War II. Latino [ORGANIZATION]ns and Black [ORGANIZATION]ns saw the largest drop in life expectancy [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], respectively, while white [ORGANIZATION]ns faced the smallest decline [ORGANIZATION], according to a report from the CDC.From the [ORGANIZATION] issue [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION] can be hazardous to your healthThe racial disparities in life expectancy had been narrowing for [LOCATION]0. In [LOCATION]1, white [ORGANIZATION]ns expected to live [LOCATION]2 than Black [ORGANIZATION]ns. In [LOCATION]3, the gap was [LOCATION]4. But the disproportionate impact of [ORGANIZATION] people reversed the trend. In [LOCATION]5, white [ORGANIZATION]ns were expected to live [LOCATION]6 longer than Black [ORGANIZATION]ns.According to a preliminary analysis, life expectancy in GPE2 continued to decline in [LOCATION]7, while bouncing back in other wealthy countries. This continued [PERSON] decline was almost entirely driven by deaths among white [ORGANIZATION]ns, according to estimates-not because people of color are replacing them but, in part, because white people accounted for a larger share of people opposing [PERSON] vaccines and the policies that reduce the spread of the disease, according to researchers. Some of the very people pushing the [ORGANIZATION] theory were convincing their white viewers, readers, and constituents to resist shutdowns, to not wear masks, to not get vaccinated. Why? As my ORG2 colleague PERSON5 observed back in May [LOCATION]5 To restrict the freedom of white [ORGANIZATION]ns, just because nonwhite [ORGANIZATION]ns are dying, is an egregious violation of the racial contract.Tragically, white people are still dying of racist whiteness and blaming their deaths on Black and Latino people, who are dying at even higher rates from the same racist whiteness-its structural violence, its unending terror, its vicious neglect. The most prominent [ORGANIZATION] theorists, who claim to care about white lives, dont seem to care about white lives as they pour toxic disinformation and racist ideas into white communities, causing many white people to hardly care about people of color. If theres anything white people should have learned from the pandemic, it is this To not care about people of color is to not care about people.Before I begin I will say that I was not born racist nor grew up to be racist, the screed said. I simply became racist after I learned the truth.PERSON6 [LOCATION] power, white violenceThe [PERSON] killer started to be racist when he learned to deny the truth. The historical truth is that racist policy has allowed white [ORGANIZATION]ns to enjoy remarkable unearned privilege. Efforts to roll back racist policy, to create equity, are not an attack on white people but an attack on racism. As white privileges are rolled back, the privileges of living in a democratic, healthy, safe, equitable, and just society are rolled forward for everyone in the society, including white people.But n [ORGANIZATION] theorists refuse to acknowledge all the porous conditions and policies causing white people to die at high rates from all the leading causes of death-and people of color to die at even higher rates. They refuse to discuss racial disparities in mortality, in life expectancy. But if communities of color are particularly vulnerable, they have also responded to death and harm and disease by caring for others. Latino [ORGANIZATION]ns 21 percent, African [ORGANIZATION]ns 20.3 percent, and Asian [ORGANIZATION]ns 19.7 percent have a higher reported prevalence of caregiving than [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]ns 16.9 percent. African [ORGANIZATION]n caregivers are more likely to experience high burdens from caregiving than their white peers, and on average, spend [TIME] per week on caregiving.[ORGANIZATION], the [LOCATION]9 mother of a retired [PERSON] fire commissioner, visited her husband at a nursing home, a visit she made DATE20 without fail. After her visit on [ORGANIZATION], she stopped by [ORGANIZATION] for groceries. She was killed. PERSON8, DATE21, shopped all the time at [ORGANIZATION] for her brother and his family. We dont really have family in the area, so it was just a great help that she could do something for us like that, her brother, [ORGANIZATION], told [PERSON]. [PERSON] needed this help because he is recovering from leukemia. His sister was killed too.Black and Latino people with acute myeloid leukemia [ORGANIZATION] are more likely to die of the disease than white people. Structural racism assessed by census tract variables accounts for nearly all Black-[LOCATION] and Hispanic-[LOCATION] disparity in [ORGANIZATION] survival, researchers found in a recent study in [LOCATION].Structural racism killed Black people in east [PERSON] and then the gunman killed the survivors. In DATE22, a local report found the [PERSON]-Niagara region to be one of the most segregated in the nation. Segregation imposes a wide range of costs on people of color, impairing their health, education, job access, and wealth, [LOCATION]. Individuals living in segregated neighborhoods tend to have less access to services that allow adequate standards of living, and their economic mobility is severely impaired. The neighborhood that the white supremacist targeted had long experienced food apartheid the [ORGANIZATION] grocery store was the only nearby source of fresh, nutritious food, reported The [PERSON] News.The victims of this white supremacist had been striving to address the effects of racist policy and make up for the lack of goods and services in this Black community. PERSON11 often drove people to this sole grocery store and had gone to the soup kitchen before going to [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION]. The white supremacist killed PERSON12 as he helped someone put packages in their car.PERSON13 The intersectionality of hatePearly Young-Miss Pearly, as the DATE23 was known-ran a food pantry in the area for DATE24. At church, she taught [LOCATION] school, worked with youth, and often cooked large pots of vegetable soup for everyone. PERSON14, a DATE25 member of a group called [ORGANIZATION], had written several letters to [PERSON] publications calling for stricter gun-control measures to keep her community safe. She was killed by a man armed with an assault rifle and the lethal idea that Black people like her were the replacers. The horror is unspeakable, like when enslavers cast themselves as benevolently paternal, and cast the enslaved, who they tortured, as violent beasts.It is one thing to deny the racist policy structure harming and killing Black people and other people. But the depths of racist denial are reached when white supremacists frame Black people as the primary perpetrators and white people as the primary victims of racial harm. This ideology stirs and justifies white-supremacist terror and the terrible veiling of lethally racist policy structure. Black people are facing the double terror of racist policy and racist violence. Victims of racism are being mass murdered again and again.But through it all, through all the pain and mourning, through all the [ORGANIZATION] theories replacing reality, Black people have been like the victims of this latest mass murder finding bliss with [PERSON], caring for the sick and shut in, and never wavering in our anti-racist resistance. Black people have never wavered in our efforts to abolish the double terror, have never wavered in our struggle to live, have never wavered in allying with other people facing similar racist terrors, have never wavered in the human pursuit of joy, of peace, of beauty. And we never will."

Image via [ORGANIZATION]. ___ Gov.[PERSON] is no stranger to criticizing [PERSON] and national3 media coverage of his pandemic response. But ORG1 Democrats said reporters havent done enough to hold the Governor accountable during his press conferences. When a ORG2 reporter noted during [ORGANIZATION] news conference that the Governor has largely ignored previous requests by the minority party, Sen. [PERSON] flipped the question on its head in defense of his caucus efforts. Sen. [PERSON] flipped the script on the media treatment of [PERSON]. Image via PERSON3. I noticed that during the [PERSON] press conferences, you all in the media ask questions of the Governor as well, and sometimes, Im wondering are the questions going to be more direct from you all as well, the [ORGANIZATION] Senator said. [ORGANIZATION] also noted a heckler who interrupted PERSON5 by shouting, Shame on you! at the start of his conference in [PERSON]. That heckler provided more interaction and incitement in challenging the Governor, he said. When I hear the press conferences, Im listening, and all I see is the same-old-same-old, him giving excuses, you all asking a question, and him deflecting as if theres absolutely nothing wrong, [ORGANIZATION] added. [ORGANIZATION] Democrats have made a growing list of requests to [PERSON] about [ORGANIZATION], most of which have gone unanswered. Among other demands, Democrats have called for a Special Session5 on the virus, a mask mandate6, data [PERSON], and a [PERSON] regarding the viruss resurgence. Meanwhile, the Governor implemented a DATE2 safer-at-home order, partly meeting a Democratic request, before revealing reopening plans Democrats say moved too quickly. He has also repeatedly extended the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures. However, he gave no credit to Democrats for neither of those orders. Nevertheless, Democrats have sent repeated letters to administration officials and plan to make their own press conferences responding to the [PERSON] briefings a regular occurrence. If were in [PERSON], were holding our mics up, were standing up, were saying that this is ridiculous, and this is beyond the pale, [ORGANIZATION] said. We are past being upset about this. When the Facebook Live stream closed and Senators believed they had the [PERSON] room to themselves, they began sharing their private thoughts. But reporters who had connected through [PERSON] were still connected to the meeting. Sens.PERSON7 PERSON[DATE] agreed the press conference went well. We should show up and heckle. Thats how we should get our message across, [ORGANIZATION] quipped. We should all show up at his press conferences with press credentials and heckle him. During the conference, [PERSON]0 had taken an animated and personal approach[DATE] by invoking her [ORGANIZATION] mother and deeming herd immunity as a strategy for impala on the African plains. But after the press conference, she started to take aim at the question by the ORG2 reporter. [PERSON]1 question kind of pissed me off a little bit because she was basically saying, Dont waste your time,  [PERSON]0 began before a ORG1 aide cut her off. The aide then began removing unwanted participants from the [PERSON] call. Its ok, it doesnt matter. Its the [STREET] I feel. I dont care. Write about it, she joked.

There is failed leadership in the [PERSON] office, [ORGANIZATION] ORG1 Minority Leader [PERSON] said during an online news conference shortly after health officials reported 10,1[DATE]1 new confirmed cases. The new report brings the total number of confirmed cases to 301,[DATE]10 since the outbreak began in the state on [LOCATION][DATE]. The state recorded 1[ORGANIZATION] deaths [ORGANIZATION], the third time in DATE20 it has reported more than 100, a mark that had only been topped once before DATE21. The state has now recorded 4,626 [ORGANIZATION] deaths. Sen. [PERSON] blasts the failures in the [PERSON] Office. Workers behind infection spike at [ORGANIZATION] nursing homes Nursing home and assisted living facilities have been reporting more coronavirus infections over DATE22 despite [PERSON] order barring visitors still being in effect. Rather than loved ones, its employees who are bringing the coronavirus into the building. As reported by PERSON33 of ORG2[DATE] [ORGANIZATION], ORG1[DATE] Secretary PERSON34 is pinning the blame on asymptomatic health workers who are spreading the virus to residents unknowingly. [ORGANIZATION] data shows an average of 2,606 nursing home residents a [LOCATION]44 tested positive DATE21, up 74 from DATE23. Over the same stretch, the infection rate among workers has nearly doubled. [PERSON] blames coronavirus testing errors on [DATE] via PERSON35 and PERSON36 of the [PERSON] Sentinel [PERSON] said the errors in coronavirus results reported by private labs were the result of a misunderstanding of how those numbers should be reported. Labs usually report only the positive results on tests of other diseases but have been ordered by [PERSON] administration to report all results for tests of [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] added that he doesnt fault [ORGANIZATION] Surgeon General PERSON37, the head of [ORGANIZATION] since its the responsibility of private labs to submit the data to the state. In [ORGANIZATION], GPE[DATE] and [PERSON]s [ORGANIZATION]2 ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION] starting DATE24, testing sites will include dedicated lanes for those showing symptoms, [PERSON] said, with a goal of getting results within DATE25. [ORGANIZATION]s hidden data skews [ORGANIZATION] test [PERSON] via PERSON3[DATE] and PERSON3[DATE] of the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] Sun-Sentinel [ORGANIZATION] might be minimizing the depth of its [ORGANIZATION] problem by underreporting its rate of positive tests, experts say. The method used to calculate the positivity rate puts more emphasis on negative tests, skewing the results in that direction. A person who tests positive is counted only once, but negative tests can be counted repeatedly if the same person got more than one test. In addition, just as the pandemic raced out of control DATE26, the state changed the formula. It now mixes two different types of tests, including one that produces more false-negative results. The upshot of both factors is that the rate of positive tests, as quoted by the state, could make the situation look significantly better than it is, experts say. [ORGANIZATION] and labs, including some in Northeast [ORGANIZATION], question accuracy of [ORGANIZATION] data1[DATE] via [ORGANIZATION]0 of The [ORGANIZATION] Times-Union [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] officials said that some laboratories have not complied with procedures for reporting negative [ORGANIZATION] tests, while some labs pointed to state errors for potentially distorting a key metric in management of the coronavirus pandemic. The statistical issues, which include the omission of negative tests from several labs as well as apparent errors in classification, further complicate the task of assessing the scale, scope and relative risks associated with the pandemic. ORG25 officials told ORG26 [ORGANIZATION] that its [ORGANIZATION] testing data as displayed by [ORGANIZATION] does not look complete. Though [ORGANIZATION]s totals for positive tests, hospitalizations, and deaths remain unaffected, the omission of negative tests potentially inflates the states positivity rate. Officials claim otherwise, but Governor says [ORGANIZATION]s [ORGANIZATION] message is consistent1[DATE] via [ORGANIZATION]1 of [ORGANIZATION] Politics Local officials DATE27 have asked for consistent [ORGANIZATION] messaging from [PERSON] administration, but the Governor on [ORGANIZATION] responded saying he has stayed consistent. During a roundtable, [ORGANIZATION]-Dade ORG5[DATE] Mayors called for unity and leadership on the states pandemic messaging. And [ORGANIZATION] morning, education leaders broke with [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]er [PERSON]4 on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]s emergency order telling schools to reopen DATE2[DATE]. The message with [ORGANIZATION]-Dade is consistent, the Governor said. Im supporting the ORG5[DATE] Mayor and what hes doing. Im supporting those municipal Mayors. I may not agree with them on everything politically, but this isnt really about politics or its not about the typical tit for tat. [PERSON] argues that [ORGANIZATION]s response to [ORGANIZATION] has been consistent. ORG1 Democrats want businesses rolled back to 25 capacity20 via [ORGANIZATION]1 of [ORGANIZATION] Politics ORG1 Democrats announced a plan [ORGANIZATION] asking the Governor to limit businesses across the state to 25 capacity. During Phase Two of [ORGANIZATION]s reopening process, [PERSON] allowed restaurants, bars, retail and other businesses to open up to 50 capacity before state business regulators reversed the order for bars. Under Phase One, restaurants and retail were allowed to operate up to 25 capacity. But with the rising number of [LOCATION]7 [ORGANIZATION] diagnoses, [ORGANIZATION] Leader [PERSON] and members of her caucus criticized the state for opening too early and forcing counties to take the lead on certain orders. That created what the Leader called a disjointed [STREET] of getting us to safety. His hands-off approach is not working, she said. Hes losing the war against the pandemic, and that means the people of the state of [ORGANIZATION] are losing the war against the pandemic. BACK TO SCHOOL?

So much so, he has threatened to relocate his factory. In the two-page letter, [PERSON]44 made his case as to why [ORGANIZATION] is the right prescription for all his woes. [PERSON]44 used more than flattery to lure the [ORGANIZATION]1 CEO. He also made a fiscal case as to why [ORGANIZATION] is the best landing pad for the business in the country.

The [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]2 of [ORGANIZATION] approved the changes earlier to[LOCATION]44 as part of its consent agenda, typically reserved for non-controversial items. The measure is included in rule changes that govern [ORGANIZATION]6. Prior to the rule change, school districts were required to inform parents about [ORGANIZATION]6 within [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]44s after a bullying incident was reported and provide the parent with a completed [ORGANIZATION]7 notification form verifying that the incident was reported. The form was needed to start the scholarship application process. [ORGANIZATION][DATE] repurposing to support gun-law reform candidates62 via [PERSON][DATE] of [ORGANIZATION] Politics Having been shot down by the [ORGANIZATION] Supreme [STREET] in effort to get an assault weapon ban question on the state ballot, [ORGANIZATION][DATE] announced [ORGANIZATION] it is changing strategy and now will seek to help elect state [PERSON]5 candidates who support gun law reforms. The political committee had spent more than 2 million trying to get a proposed assault weapons ban amendment on the statewide ballot. But in [LOCATION]04 n a 4-1 decision, ORG120 ruled ORG121 proposed ballot summary did not pass muster because it affirmatively misleads voters and so the proposal could not be put on the ballot.

Estate, voting rights groups battle at high [LOCATION] via [PERSON]4[DATE] of the News Service of [ORGANIZATION] A battle over voting rights in [ORGANIZATION] is playing out at the GPE44 Supreme [STREET], with the ability of hundreds of thousands of felons to cast ballots. Attorneys for the state and voting-rights groups filed briefs DATE27 at ORG120 as they continue wrangling over a challenge to a [ORGANIZATION]6 state law requiring felons to pay legal financial obligations to be eligible to vote. Voting-rights groups argue that linking voting rights and finances amounts to an unconstitutional poll tax. The voting-rights groups went to ORG120 DATE21 after [LOCATION] Judge [PERSON][DATE] said the state cannot deny voting rights to felons who cannot afford to pay [STREET]-ordered financial obligations associated with their convictions. Jury selection via [PERSON] First [ORGANIZATION]-Dade case is a glimpse of [STREET] in the coronavirus era64 via [PERSON]50 of the ORG2 [STREET] was back in session in [ORGANIZATION]-Dade ORG5[DATE] DATE27, but it was not business as usual. In a first run of what could be a model for the rest of the state, a civil suit DATE27 over a home insurance dispute gave a glimpse of how the justice system hoped to adapt to the new socially distant normal as [ORGANIZATION] cases surge in [ORGANIZATION]. Jurors were selected via [PERSON], attorneys made opening statements wearing protective masks and the trial was streamed on ORG127. It worked pretty well aside from some technical glitches and an awkward moment or two. During a [PERSON] call to pick a jury, some prospects forgot to unmute while answering questions and one even forgot to do the opposite during a bathroom break, producing a sound effect that drew a few odd looks among those on the call. [PERSON]51 offers 1.[LOCATION]0B GPE[DATE] budget no tax rate change65 via [PERSON]24 Patterson of The [ORGANIZATION] Times-Union [PERSON]53 offered a 1.[LOCATION]0 billion budget [ORGANIZATION] that leaves tax rates unchanged and represents nearly status quo spending after [LOCATION]05 of extraordinary challenges from the coronavirus pandemic. We need to recognize what a difference [LOCATION]05 can make, [PERSON]53 said, describing this spending plan as the result of my steadfast commitment to being a responsible steward of public money. [PERSON]53 proposed 240 million in big-ticket capital projects like drainage and roadwork, including about 100 million for projects in four LOC[DATE] and [PERSON]side ORG12[DATE] districts - 7, [DATE], [DATE] and 10 - with a history of unmet needs.

Scattered problems with mail-in ballots DATE51 signal potential [LOCATION]06 challenges for ORG145 via [PERSON]62 of [ORGANIZATION] caused by a spike in absentee voting during DATE51s primaries are serving as potential warning signs for [ORGANIZATION], which is bracing for an expected onslaught of mail-in ballots [LOCATION]07 as states and cities push alternatives to in-person voting because of the pandemic. The concern extends to local elections offices that may be unaccustomed to aspects of the mail, such as the time it takes for parcels to reach their destinations and how to design their ballots to meet postal standards. Local elections offices are hiring temporary workers to process absentee ballots, and some local elections boards are adding options for voters to do curbside drop-offs of their mail ballots on [LOCATION]0[DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] doctors [PERSON][DATE] tweet to solve mail-in voting problem6[DATE] via [PERSON]61 of ORG1[DATE] [PERSON][DATE]s harsh rhetoric against mail-in voting is causing a big problem for [ORGANIZATION] Republicans, who once dominated the practice here. So the state [PERSON] came up with a solution They doctored one of [PERSON][DATE]s tweets on the issue to remove the stigma. Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them, [PERSON][DATE] said in the tweet. The rest of the quote was blurred out Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is GPE65 history. Bad things happen with [ORGANIZATION].

According to a new report from ORG1[DATE], a get-out-the-vote specialist named [PERSON]24 [PERSON]66 claims [PERSON] is already out after the [PERSON]0 founder hired both paid and volunteer staff to help him secure signatures in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] Carolina to get him on the ballot. [PERSON]66 claimed [PERSON]s team was working over [LOCATION]10 there, formalizing the [PERSON]1 and other things that theyve got to do when you have a lot of corporate lawyers involved. A separate source, who remained anonymous, claimed to the outlet that they were hired for 5,000 to help [PERSON] gather signatures in [ORGANIZATION] to meet the states [ORGANIZATION]4 [ORGANIZATION] ballot deadline.

In a news release, the campaign said it had cleared [LOCATION]40,000 in total fundraising as of [LOCATION]04 30. [PERSON]75s campaign didnt state whether the new funds were all from donors or included candidate loans, though it did take some jabs at incumbent GPE44 Rep. [PERSON]77. Im honored by the support our campaign has received, and well continue working to ensure we win the Republican primary to take on [PERSON]77 in the general election, [PERSON]75 said. Through [LOCATION]20, [PERSON]75 had raised about 211,000 and lent his campaign another 131,000. The account had 276,000 on hand on [PERSON]4 31. [PERSON] falls further behind [PERSON]7[DATE] in CD 26 fundraising [LOCATION] via [PERSON]7[DATE] of [ORGANIZATION] Politics [PERSON][DATE]0 is trailing [PERSON]2 for [LOCATION]22, according to the most recent financial reports filed with [PERSON]3 [PERSON]1.

[PERSON][DATE]0 has now topped 1 million raised in [DATE] since he entered the race in [LOCATION]25. [PERSON]2, however, added close to [DATE]37,000 during [LOCATION]26, topping [PERSON][DATE]0 by nearly 220,000. Overall, shes raised nearly 3.[DATE] million [LOCATION]27. [PERSON][DATE]0, however, must compete in the Republican primary against [PERSON][DATE]1, the former head of [ORGANIZATION]-Dade Firefighters Local 1403. That could further cause [PERSON][DATE]0 to burn through his war chest more quickly in the next two [ORGANIZATION]2 than [PERSON]2. [PERSON][DATE]2 says Republican leadership is lying about her immigration record74 via [PERSON][DATE]3 of [ORGANIZATION] Politics [PERSON][DATE]4, in a fundraising appeal, accused the [ORGANIZATION] Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee of lying about her record.

[PERSON]7 caught in a [ORGANIZATION] about my record, an email blast subject line reads. In question is a negative ad from the committee slamming [PERSON][DATE]7 record in the ORG7 on issues including immigration. [PERSON][DATE]4 turned her back on President [PERSON][DATE], refusing to ban sanctuary cities, the ad states. The ad also hits on subjects like providing certain benefits to undocumented immigrants.

While [PERSON][DATE][DATE] and [PERSON][DATE][DATE] are telling voters that if elected theyll see the toll removed or reduced, fellow legislative hopeful [PERSON][DATE]0 has questioned whether that can realistically be done. [PERSON][DATE]1 and [PERSON][DATE]2, who sits on the Mid-[PERSON]2 [PERSON] Authoritys governing board, debated the issue in a [ORGANIZATION][DATE] forum hosted by [ORGANIZATION]. If outgoing Rep. [PERSON][DATE]3 couldnt get that done and [PERSON][DATE]4, as president of the ORG1 couldnt get it done we need to be careful when people tell us they can just do it, [PERSON][DATE]2 said.

Like most of you, I took precautions, followed the advice of health experts, wore a mask in public, washed my hands regularly, and observed social distancing, [PERSON]07 said in the statement. Yet, despite this vigilance, I have contracted the virus, [PERSON]07 said he was tested at the urging of family and friends after experiencing symptoms for [LOCATION]30.

[PERSON]11 appearance in the election has been limited thus far to some polling and research provided to an independent committee supporting [PERSON]15. [PERSON]16 campaign raised concerns about [PERSON]11 potential involvement as possibly the first indication he might try to overwhelm the contest with outside money, as he did in [LOCATION]31. [PERSON]15s campaign responded by accusing [PERSON]16 campaign of using the same anti-Semitic [PERSON]11 trope that the President of GPE45 also uses. Sheriff [PERSON]1[DATE] reacts to union pulling endorsement I have made difficult decisions[DATE]4 via [PERSON]1[DATE] of the [PERSON] Sentinel [LOCATION]32 after the union that represents [ORGANIZATION]2 ORG5[DATE] deputies voted to rescind its endorsement of Sheriff [PERSON]20, he reacted by pledging to stay the course despite signs of mounting dissatisfaction within the agency. The changes I have instituted at ORG167 might have been the impetus of this decision, [PERSON]20 said in a statement. If thats the case, I accept that. I have made difficult decisions and have levied harsh discipline for policy violations, including terminating deputies for excessive force. He added he is committed to having conversations with our deputies to improve and strengthen ORG16[DATE], and also to implement and enforce policies that keep our community safe and hold our deputies accountable. Recruiting bogus candidates is shady politics for scared politician[DATE]5 via [PERSON]21 of the [PERSON] Sentinel [ORGANIZATION]2 ORG5[DATE] [ORGANIZATION]er [PERSON]22 is obviously nervous about getting re-elected and for good reason. She has cast a number of rotten votes, including one to give Universal [PERSON] up to [ORGANIZATION]5 million to help build a [STREET] for their new theme park even as the county prepared to ask residents to raise their own taxes to pay for new roads elsewhere. And another vote supporting a toll [STREET] that would plow through an environmental preserve. Because nothing screams environmental protection like four lanes of concrete. So, with [PERSON]23 running scared, her campaign team recruited and funded a bogus write-in candidate to run against her. That may sound strange until you realize how [ORGANIZATION]s whacked-out elections work. TOP OPINION The pandemic could get much, much worse. We must act now.[DATE]6 via [PERSON]24 for The [PERSON]4 Times With the coronavirus, GPE45 has proved politics hasnt worked. If we are to fully reopen both the economy and schools safely we have to return to science. [ORGANIZATION] says the country has to learn to live with the virus. Thats one thing if new cases occurred at the rates in GPE6[DATE] or GPE[DATE], not to mention [PERSON] Korea or GPE71 or GPE72. Its another thing when GPE45 has the highest growth rate of new cases in the world, ahead even of [LOCATION]. In GPE45, public health experts were virtually unanimous that replicating European success required, first, maintaining the shutdown until we achieved a steep downward slope in cases second, getting widespread compliance with public health advice and third, creating a workforce of at least 100,000 to test, trace and isolate cases. Nationally we came nowhere near any of those goals. OPINIONS The nation is in a downward spiral. Worse is still to come.[DATE]7 via [PERSON]25 of The [PERSON]0 Post Never has a GPE44 election come at such a moment of national mortification. The nations floundering government is now administered by a gangster regime. It is helpful to have this made obvious as voters contemplate renewing the regimes lease on the executive branch. [LOCATION]33, the pandemic will be an accelerant of preexisting trends There will be a surge of early and mail voting. So, an unambiguous decision by [DATE] will require a popular-vote tsunami so large against the President that there will be a continentwide guffaw when he makes charges, as surely he will, akin to those he made in [LOCATION]31. Then, he said he lost the popular vote by 2.[DATE] million because millions of undocumented immigrants voted against him. [PERSON], [PERSON][DATE] missed their chance to fully reopen schools[DATE][DATE] via [PERSON]26 of the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] Sun-Sentinel Maybe [PERSON] realized how callous he sounded in comparing the reopening of public schools to the reopening of ORG170 or [LOCATION]. Whatever the reason, the Governor pivoted [LOCATION] from his insistence that all students be back on campus DATE2[DATE]. Parents, [PERSON] said, should choose. [PERSON][DATE] threatened DATE21 to withhold money from districts that fail to reopen fully. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]er [PERSON]4 DATE21 issued an order that all school boards and charter school governing boards must open brick and mortar schools [ORGANIZATION]3 per [LOCATION]12 for all students. A competent [PERSON][DATE] administration would have started planning how to reopen schools as soon as they closed four [ORGANIZATION]2 ago. A competent [PERSON] administration would have done the same thing. Bullying the [ORGANIZATION]-Dade school district to reopen in [ORGANIZATION]2 is just reckless[DATE][DATE] via the ORG2 editorial board The monumental decision on whether to reopen [ORGANIZATION]-Dade schools in [ORGANIZATION]2 is not on [ORGANIZATION]s School [PERSON]2 agenda, but its likely to pop up. After all, how to deal with this pandemic is the districts most crucial decision in [LOCATION]36. The burden of deciding whether we continue with online schooling whether we physically return to class return to class physically, falls largely on [PERSON] PERSON56 and the elected members of the School [PERSON]2, who rely on his counsel.

In fact, they went to the high courts own advisory opinion in another recent case to make their point. Heres what happened Two justices resigned to take seats on the federal bench and [PERSON] appointed [PERSON]30 and [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]31 to replace them. No problem with [PERSON]32, but [PERSON]30 is a bit short of being a member of the [ORGANIZATION] Bar for 10 [ORGANIZATION]7, a requirement for appellate judges.

I walked on everything, said [PERSON]37, a frequent park-goer. Ive never seen the park like this. No doubt, many would-be visitors are wary of going to FAC15 parks during a pandemic. But the thin crowds may largely be the result of limits imposed by a new reservation system, part of the companys cautious approach to reopening attractions.

Its members. I dont want to call anybody out. But this is the conversation that is taking [STREET].[PERSON] said his disappointment in [LOCATION] stems in large part from what he sees as his partys weak efforts to develop a compelling alternative agenda to that of [PERSON], a Republican.Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on not only in [PERSON], [PERSON] and [PERSON] but in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], [PERSON] and GPE9, he said. Democratic voters at least and voters writ large feel politically homeless, and its because we are not offering something affirmative to give people hope and something to invest in, in the [STREET] that we want to do things.[LOCATION] and ORG5 Minority Leader [PERSON], a [PERSON]0 Democrat, teamed up [ORGANIZATION] to promote a Democratic agenda called A [ORGANIZATION]. The effort calls for increased federal investment in infrastructure, public housing and education, a series of political and labor reforms and an effort to reduce prescription drug prices.[PERSON] stressed that he did not mean to criticize [PERSON]0 or his role in that effort, but the [PERSON]1 congressman had harsh words for A [ORGANIZATION].Its thematic, its well-intentioned, but nobodys buying it, [PERSON] said of the Democratic agenda. Its [PERSON]2-speak.Democrats would be better off, [PERSON] said, if they stressed two issues that he said arent stressed strongly enough in A [ORGANIZATION] health care and infrastructure investment.Most notably, he mentioned the bill that he introduced [PERSON] that would allow Americans from [ORGANIZATION] to buy into [LOCATION], the federal health care program for Americans over [ORGANIZATION] said [LOCATION] and her staff have shown little interest in the bill.They say it does not comply with the essential benefits of the Affordable Care Act, [PERSON] said. That is not true....[PERSON] argued that his [LOCATION] expansion bill would offer health care to a particularly vulnerable population middle-aged Americans who are coping with huge health insurance price increases because of Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as [PERSON]1. Every congressional district is home to approximately 14,000 such people,he said.In addition, he said the bill would stabilize [LOCATION]s finances, given that it would bring younger, healthier Americans into the system.[PERSON] [LOCATION] expansion bill has 49 cosponsors, where his bill to invest 1.5 trillion in American infrastructure has none.A [ORGANIZATION] includes a proposal for a smaller, 1 trillion infrastructure plan, but [PERSON] said Democrats arent doing a very good job of selling it to the public.Theres little mention of the fact that a huge infrastructure bill would create upwards of 34.5 million jobs and add 1.5 percentage points to the [DATE] growth rate, thereby boosting the economy and cutting the federal deficit, [PERSON] argued.So infrastructure pays for itself and investment helps fund all the other Democratic priorities education, health care and the environment, he said.[PERSON] singled out [LOCATION] for failing to clearly articulate a Democratic agenda, and mentioned several current ORG7 members as possible alternatives to the current leader Current Minority Whip [PERSON]2 of [PERSON]3, Rep. [PERSON]3 of [PERSON]4 and Rep. [PERSON]4 of GPE23-- a close friend of [PERSON].[PERSON]3 was elected Speaker of the [PERSON]4 State Assembly in [LOCATION], only the second woman to serve in that position. So she knows how to do it. Rated A by ORG9, she has one of the best voting records in [ORGANIZATION]. [LOCATION] doesnt want to leave the speakership to [PERSON]5, which would be like leaving the speakership to [ORGANIZATION]. The only thing worse would be leaving the speakership to Wall [STREET]-- and that the most likely post-[LOCATION] Speaker [PERSON]4, a crook, a machine hack, a Wall [STREET] puppet2 and, until he decided to run for party-wide leadership, head of the Wall [STREET] owned and operated New Dems. I cant think of anyone worse.But he appears to have it sewn up. Most Democrats in the ORG7 are either enthusiastic about him or resigned to what hes made them all think is inevitable. What can we do? [PERSON]7 is virtually unknown in his own district where hes like an absentee landlord. He and his family live in [PERSON]5. He has a credible primary challenge in DATE8 [ORGANIZATION]. His opponent, [PERSON]8, is more of the district than he is. And shes making a strong grassroots attempt to dislodge him. If she wins, he wont be Speaker-- and Wall [STREET] will lose its biggest [PERSON] among ORG7 Democrats. [LOCATION]0, [PERSON]9, published a brilliant piece in [ORGANIZATION]0, How People Close The [PERSON]4 Have [PERSON] While The GPE23 Boss Has Risen In [ORGANIZATION]3. His rise to the speakership could be another death knell for [ORGANIZATION]. The crooks may be tolerated-- bad enough-- but they should never be the top man. Play Video4 The rise of [ORGANIZATION]man [PERSON]4, D-[PERSON]6, has coincided with lucrative lobbying contracts for his younger brother,John [PERSON]7, an attorney who goes by the first name [LOCATION]2, and previously specialized in wills and estate law.[LOCATION]2 [PERSON]7 serves as a partner atORG26tron LLP, a powerhouse law firm with offices in [PERSON]7, [PERSON]0 City, and [PERSON]2, [PERSON]9, that advertises its ability to connect clients with congressional leadership.Over [LOCATION]1, clients with interests before [ORGANIZATION] haveretained [LOCATION]2 [PERSON]7 through his lobbying firm, paying more than 4.5 million to influence and monitor government policies, according to a review of contracts by [ORGANIZATION]0.Clients in [LOCATION]2 have included [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]4, [PERSON]0 Community Bancorp, [ORGANIZATION]6, and [ORGANIZATION]7 ...ftware.In many cases, the interests of [LOCATION]2 [PERSON]7s clients have overlapped with his elder brothers legislative and political work.[LOCATION]3, [PERSON]4voted in favor of President Donald [PERSON]s effort to repeal a rule established by [ORGANIZATION]8 designed to prevent racial discrimination in the auto loan industry.The legislation was heavily promoted by [ORGANIZATION]9, the [PERSON]0 affiliate of which retains [LOCATION]2 [PERSON]7 as a lobbyist on regulatory issues, including cityrulesmeant to curb predatory lending practices.In 2013,[PERSON]4 helped award 10 million in federal assistance to [ORGANIZATION], a merchants association in the GPE20 that retained [LOCATION]2 [PERSON]7 as a lobbyist.In [LOCATION]4, both [PERSON]7 brothers worked to assist the life insurance settlement industry. [LOCATION]5 after President [LOCATION]7 inauguration,[PERSON]4, newly empowered with his first major leadership postat the Democratic [ORGANIZATION]ional Campaign Committee and a perch on the powerful committee dealing with tax legislation, traveled to GPE21, GPE22, to address hundreds of financial representatives.Joe[PERSON]7, speaking to the ORG22 [DATE] meeting, reassured executives,and noted that [LOCATION]9 had made no mention of life insurance or life insurance settlements during his recent speech outlining his tax agenda, suggesting the audience might be spared from any future tax hikes.I think for your industry, that is a good thing, said [PERSON]7. It doesnt mean that youre out of the woods, but its a good thing.The congressman encouraged the attendees to contact Democratic lawmakers on ORG23 and continue to lobby to share their views.The friendly chat coincided with a lucrative contract for [PERSON]7s younger brother, [LOCATION]2, who was retained by ORG24 [LOCATION]6 to influence tax legislation on ORG25. [LOCATION]2 [PERSON]7s lobbying firm,ORG26tron, went on to collect 140,000 on behalf of the life insurance settlement client.The engagement with the life insurance settlement lobby also provided a lift to[PERSON]4. He was the largest recipient of ORG27 action committee donations during the [LOCATION]7 election cycle....A report [PERSON] in the [PERSON]0 Post revealed that Joe[PERSON]7 has also paid nearly 70,000 in campaign funds to a company owned by [LOCATION]2, ORG29. [PERSON]4 claimed the money was rent for a campaign office, though the space owned by the younger [PERSON]7 brother is outside the district.Before working as a lobbyist, [LOCATION]2 served as an attorney at a firm called [PERSON]7, [PERSON]7...ufman, a partnership with PERSON31, the treasurer of[PERSON]4s political action committee.Joe[PERSON]7 has faced [LOCATION]8 of headlines chargingthat he engagesin nepotism and unethical political patronage. As the boss of [PERSON]1, he hasnominated associates to the borough election commission, helped allies win election to the [PERSON]0 City Council, and appointed family friends to [PERSON]3.The [STREET] appointments have gained increasing scrutiny after reports that associates of[PERSON]4 are routinely selected as [STREET]-appointed guardians who have earned millions of dollars processing the estates of residents who pass away withoutestablishing a will.PERSON32, an official at [PERSON]1 and a [PERSON]7 lieutenant, has raked in over 30 million administering estates through his position as an administration attorney at [PERSON]4, which he won through hisrelationship with[PERSON]4.Before becoming a lobbyist, [LOCATION]2 [PERSON]7 also served as a [STREET]-appointed guardian. PERSON33 has continued to serve as one, earning around 550,000from work assigned through [PERSON]5. Notably, PERSON33 now faces a state ethics probe for potentially violating [STREET] administration rules on compensation....The convergence of business and politics in the GPE23 Democratic machine reflects[PERSON]4s ascent through the ranks of ORG7 Democratic leadership.Joe[PERSON]7has gathered power through high-level connections with well-placed political figures and business leaders. The previous lawmaker to serve in his seat,Rep. [PERSON], D-[PERSON]6, another GPE23 [PERSON]6 boss, quietlyselected [PERSON]7 as his successor just before the legal filing deadline in [LOCATION]9, while deceiving the public and claiming he would run for re-election, a strategy that effectively prevented a competitive election.In [ORGANIZATION],[PERSON]4 has served as a liaison between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], often mobilizing opposition to bank regulations and other rules opposed by major donors to the party. In DATE20, he won a low-ranking position with the [PERSON]7, helping to serve on an outreach council to the business community. But[PERSON]4 proved a prodigious fundraiser, helping to raise 5 million for the party, a capability that catapulted him to serve as vice chair of the [PERSON]7 four [LOCATION]8 later.In [LOCATION]4, he was elected as the leader of [PERSON]8, a moderate shame of PERSON37 for referring to conservatives as moderrates caucus that used its political weight to weaken financial reform. [PERSON]9 famously threatened to defeat the [PERSON]-Frank financial reform law unless amendments were added to provide less stringent rules on derivatives and pre-emption of stronger state-based bank regulations. As[PERSON]4 and other New Democrat leaders marshaled political support for changes to the bill, the lawmakers went on a rapid fundraising spree, collecting checks from Wall [STREET] banks that were seeking to influence the legislation.The Office of [ORGANIZATION]ional Ethics opened an investigation into[PERSON]4s financial reform-related fundraisers, though the ORG7 [ORGANIZATION], which outranks the [LOCATION]2 and is stacked with fellow lawmakers,later declined to continue the probe.In the [LOCATION]8 since passage of financial reform,[PERSON]4 has continued to chip away at tough rules on banks while vacuuming up Wall [STREET] donations. In [DATE], he co-authored a letter requesting that regulators withdraw and revise the fiduciary rule, a high-profile consumer safeguard designed to ensure that financial planners act only in the interests of their clients. [PERSON], aftermeeting with bank executives,[PERSON]4 and other New Democrats sent a letter to regulators requesting a delay to [ORGANIZATION], one of the signature restrictions on big banks, designed to preventreckless proprietary trading.The letters, again, coincided with a steady flow of bank and corporate contributions to[PERSON]4s political action committees, which include a leadership [ORGANIZATION], a joint fundraising committee, and a personal [ORGANIZATION]. Following the DATE25 election,[PERSON]4 was elected as chair of [ORGANIZATION], making him the fourth ranking member in leadership.Now, the [PERSON] administration has signaled that it is working to unravel both provisions of financial reform criticized by[PERSON]4s letters and is making headway in relaxing other aspects of the [PERSON]-Frank law. That[PERSON]4 previouslytargeted thesame financial regulations that are now in the crosshairs of [PERSON] contrasts sharply with the image the GPE23 Democrat has portrayed in his campaign advertising, which depict him as a bold opponent of the president.Despite a relatively conservative voting recordwhile representing a deeply Democratic district--[PERSON]7 not only has been a consistent friend to the banking lobby, but voted for the Iraq War, the Patriot Act, and a controversial bill in DATE20 to limit consumer bankruptcy [PERSON] he is currently maneuvering to become the next speaker of the ORG7.DATE26, members of the New Democrat caucus providedstrong support for a Republican-led bill to increase the bank threshold for systemic risk assessments, raising the size at which regulators provide additional scrutiny from 50 billion to 250 billion in bank assets.Facing pressure from[PERSON]8-Cortez, a progressive challenging[PERSON]4 in the Democratic primary on [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]1 chief abandoned his moderate pro-bank colleagues. This time, he bucked his New Democrat colleagues and voted against the bill weakening [PERSON]-Frank. [PERSON]7, facing a tightening race, has begun to spend heavily on television to stave off a major upset, and has agreed to debate PERSON41-Cortez. It will air this eveningy on GPE21 in [TIME]. I tried explain DATE27 afternoon-- here5-- many Democrats in [ORGANIZATION] who want to stay on his good side or because they are afraid of him and because freshmen and sophomores are largely unaware of what a crooked conservative [PERSON]7 is are going along with his rise. The co-chair of [LOCATION]5, PERSON42, who has the 3rd best voting record in the whole [ORGANIZATION]-- and who should be a candidate for Speaker [PERSON] is actually whipping for [PERSON]7 and telling naive progressives that [PERSON]7 is trustworthy and a fellow progressive! PERSON43 is a good man... and he should know better. I would like everyone reading this to please consider helping replace [PERSON]4 and the threat he is to [ORGANIZATION] and to the [ORGANIZATION] one [PERSON] is already too much-- by contributing to [PERSON]8s campaign. And you can do that by tapping on the [LOCATION]6 DATE28 congressional campaign thermometer on the right and giving what you can.  1  2  3  4  5"

[PERSON]ers Weigh in65 These are difficult times for most Canadian families. The exorbitant price of gasoline is having an impact on the price of the grocery basket, which was already on the rise. In addition, there is the explosion in the cost of rent and energy, which is contributing to the impoverishment of the middle class and those who are already below the poverty line. The government does not want to remove taxes on gasoline because it is good for the environment. Premier PERSON5, for his part, has decided to offer 500 to [PERSON]ers to help them with inflation. 66 18 [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, And ORG3 to be Sued Over [PERSON] by [PERSON] via [ORGANIZATION] emphasis ours [ORGANIZATION] has filed a lawsuit against [ORGANIZATION], on behalf of ORG6 and ORG7 employees, and plans to sue all major airlines, 18 altogether, plus ORG8 ORG2 and [ORGANIZATION], contending that the vaccine mandates imposed by these agencies on the airlines employees infringed on their constitutional, religious, and medical liberties. The lawsuit against [ORGANIZATION] was filed in federal [STREET] in [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION], with over 100 plaintiffs pursuing litigation. Fundamentally, this case is about whether [PERSON]8ns should be required to choose between their livelihoods and being coerced into taking an experimental, dangerous medical treatment, reads the lawsuit 68 [PERSON]0-Allied Democrat Backtracks on Saying the Homeless Should Break Into and Occupy Homes After [PERSON] state congressional candidate PERSON8, who was endorsed by [PERSON]1 and is allied with [PERSON]0, previously said in a campaign ad that when she wins the election, a million people living in the [PERSON] should break into empty houses and live in them so that [PERSON]2 will pass housing legislation. After significant blowback, PERSON9 is now changing her tune. 70 [PERSON]3 Makes Further Push Into [ORGANIZATION] IDs, With Drivers Licenses Now in [PERSON] has joined the ever-growing plan by [PERSON]3 to get people to carry digital IDs. Citizens of the state can now connect their ID and drivers licenses to [PERSON]3 Wallet to get a digital identification. A similar feature has already been rolled out in GPE7. At certain [PERSON]4 checkpoints at airports participating in the program like FAC0 and GPE3 International, residents of [ORGANIZATION] can use their iPhone or [PERSON]3 Watch to verify their identity. The digital ID will not replace the physical ID. The states website clearly states that law enforcement will not accept the mobile ID, meaning residents still have to carry their physical ID anyway. 72 Authorities Investigating Whether Retired Federal Agent Had Advanced Notice of GPE8 Shooting73 Authorities are reportedly investigating whether a retired federal agent, who allegedly regularly communicated with GPE8 supermarket shooter [LOCATION]0 online, had [TIME] advanced notice that the [ORGANIZATION] shooting would occur. Two law enforcement officials told [ORGANIZATION] that authorities believe the former agent, who is believed to be from [LOCATION], was one of six people who had regularly communicated with [LOCATION]1 in an online chatroom. 74 [LOCATION]8 Disgraced Former [PERSON]6 Boss Blames [LOCATION]2 for Her Downfall75 In DATE0 episode of [PERSON]7, the former head of [PERSON]8 now-paused [PERSON]9 board called out ORG20 [LOCATION]2 as the beginning of the downfall of the group. [LOCATION]3 told host [LOCATION]4 So I havent done a full analysis of what happened. I do [ORGANIZATION]7 want to pull all of the tweets and kind of look to see if theres any networks that are visible there. But what I think happened is theres a very kind of tried and true method through which messages travel in the conservative media ecosystem. 76 Breaking [LOCATION] Officer Gives Timeline of School Shooting, Admits Mistakes Were Made77 [LOCATION] [PERSON]ment of Public Safety Director Steven [LOCATION]5 held a press conference on [LOCATION] to detail the timeline of the [PERSON]0 school massacre on [ORGANIZATION] and address questions as to the law enforcement response. [LOCATION]5 gave a timeline of events, one that had been lacking in [TIME] and [ORGANIZATION] after the shooting when questions arose as to why officers did not immediately pursue the shooter into the school and attempt to prevent him from killing the 19 children and 2 women who lost their lives DATE4. 78 [ORGANIZATION] ORG23 for [ORGANIZATION] On [LOCATION], ORG[ORGANIZATION]7 announced on ORG25 that their ORG22 account has been restored. In a screenshot of communications with ORG22, the ORG26 team said that the account had been disabled by mistake, and that the accounts login has been restored. Writing in response to the accounts restoration, ORG[ORGANIZATION]7 said Thank you to everyone who spoke out against this censorship and demanded we be reinstated. 80 [LOCATION]6 Foreign Policy is Driven by Impulse, Not Reason81 DATE5, questions arise about President [LOCATION]7 ability to make presidential-level decisions. The questions stem mainly from [LOCATION]8 repeated rhetorical gaffes. In a recent column in [DATE], [LOCATION]9 assembled a sampling of dozens of [LOCATION]8 misstatements since [ORGANIZATION]. Among the highlights, [LOCATION]0 told guests at [PERSON], I thank all of you for being here, and I want you to enjoy the rest of the recession. In a speech before an audience of policemen, [LOCATION]0 asked, How many police officers have multiple time and put a lion and had to do things that theyd have to think theyd have to do? Whereas [LOCATION]8 domestic policy malapropisms are generally subjects of amusement or derision with few consequences, the same cannot be said of his parallel misstatements when it comes to foreign policy. Consider the war in [PERSON]1. In [LOCATION], as [LOCATION]n troops were situated on the border with [PERSON]1 awaiting [LOCATION]n President [LOCATION]1 marching orders, [LOCATION]0 gave a press conference in which he exposed ORG28 disagreements by noting that the alliance would be divided over how to respond to a minor incursion by [LOCATION]n forces. Confusion, and worse, impulsiveness, have been the hallmarks of [LOCATION]8 decisions no less than his pronouncements. The helter-skelter withdrawal of [PERSON]2 forces from [PERSON]3 [ORGANIZATION] remains the paramount example of the impulsive nature of [LOCATION]8 foreign policy. [LOCATION]0 ordered [PERSON]2 forces to withdraw, ending a DATE9 war in humiliation and defeat without first coordinating the move with [PERSON]2 allies [DATE] [STREET] Ordered Release of [ORGANIZATION] Document Reveals 82  97 of [ORGANIZATION] A recently released confidential document reveals that a startling majority of in utero babies died after pregnant women were injected with the [ORGANIZATION] vaccine. [ORGANIZATION] requested documents related to vaccine licensing via a Freedom of Information Act Request, then sued ORG31 ORG32. In [LOCATION]0, a federal judge ordered the ORG32 incrementally release the documents it claimed would take [LOCATION]1 to process. ORG30 has posted [ORGANIZATION]s confidential documents as they have become available. In the most recent release, on [LOCATION]2, a document titled reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf disclosed on page 12 that by [LOCATION]3, 270 women had received the mRNA injection during pregnancy. But 238 cases were apparently not followed no outcome provided. And, therefore, the pregnancy outcomes for those women are unknown. The mere fact that 88 of the pregnant women injected were not followed throughout their pregnancies is deeply concerning since 1[ORGANIZATION]7 of the 270 pregnant women had some type of adverse reaction [DATE] nonserious, 75 serious according to page 12 of the same document. Among those 34 pregnancies that are known, the report indicates that 28 babies died either in utero or upon birth. Only one outcome was reported as normal, and the remaining five were reported as pending. 85 [PERSON]4 Police [LOCATION]4 Wanted for Stabbing Teen Girl Dies While Being Taken Into Custody86 [PERSON]5, [LOCATION]  [PERSON]4 police say a [LOCATION]5 suspect wanted for stabbing a teen girl died as officers were attempting to bring him into custody. According to a news release, [LOCATION]2 died at ORG34 in [PERSON]6 early [ORGANIZATION]5 morning. The ordeal began around 830 p.m. [ORGANIZATION] when [PERSON]4 officers were called to [PERSON] for a stabbing. They discovered a [LOCATION]6 girl outside of the home, bleeding from multiple stab wounds to her arms, legs and head. She was rushed to the hospital and is in stable condition. Investigators found a bloody knife inside the home. Witnesses provided police a description of [LOCATION]3 and a K9 team tracked him, eventually finding him facedown in the backyard of a FAC5 property. As [LOCATION]3 was being taken into custody, he became unresponsive, police say. Medics revived him before he was taken to ORG35. The [PERSON]7 ORG36 office will perform an autopsy on [LOCATION]3s body in order to determine the exact cause of death 87 [LOCATION]5 The Right to Bear Arms is an Important Safeguard Against Potential Tyranny of Government88 Space X and ORG37 CEO [LOCATION]5 stated in a [LOCATION]7 interview that, while he espouses the idea of strict background checks and licenses for certain firearm owners, people should generally be free to own and bear firearms in [PERSON]8. 89 [LOCATION]5 [PERSON] to Ask Her Followers Whos More Trustworthy Billionaires or Politicians90 The social media feud between [PERSON]2woman [LOCATION]6 D-[PERSON]9 and ORG37 CEO [LOCATION]5 continued [LOCATION]7 when [LOCATION]7 dared the politician to create a poll asking her followers who they find more trustworthy, billionaires or politicians. 91 ORG26 [ORGANIZATION] The left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing among [PERSON] army of fact-checkers, specifically on the topic of whether or not the [PERSON] is an energy-independent country, and at what point in time this may have been true or false. They also disagree on what facts should be used to define if that independence was reestablished during [LOCATION]8 term in office, and lost under the current administration. But what is certain is that the result is more censorship on ORG26 and ORG22, affecting posts by ORG39 MRC 27 times within [LOCATION]8 in [LOCATION]9. Both have labeled this content as missing context, which could therefore be misleading. 93 Five [ORGANIZATION]0 Cities Face Lawsuits Over Unmanned Voting Drop Boxes94 [ORGANIZATION]0 on [LOCATION]7 announced it has filed lawsuits on behalf of voters in [ORGANIZATION]0s five largest cities over illegal unmanned absentee voting drop boxes. [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3, GPE[ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6 face lawsuits for reportedly using the drop boxes, which are prohibited by [ORGANIZATION]0 election law. [ORGANIZATION]1 Special Counsel [LOCATION]9 said in a press release that the five cities made an agreement with the nonprofit [ORGANIZATION]2 to use the drop boxes to get these cities residents to vote. 95 Investigators Knock Down Claims PERSON30 Administration Doctored [PERSON] Numbers96 [ORGANIZATION] investigators have rejected a former health department employees claim that she was fired for refusing to doctor [PERSON] stats to benefit Gov. [PERSON]. The [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]ment of Healths [ORGANIZATION]4 found insufficient or no evidence that data scientist PERSON32 was told to manipulate or misrepresent pandemic numbers, [ORGANIZATION]5 reported. PERSON33, who ran [ORGANIZATION]s [PERSON]-19 data dashboard, received national attention after accusing superiors of fudging data to bolster PERSON30 case to ease restrictions. [ORGANIZATION] officials denied her charges from the outset. 97 PERSON34 Coming Out on Top in [STREET] of Public Opinion, Experts Say98 PERSON34 is coming out on top in the [STREET] of public opinion  and that could be even more important than whether he wins his bombshell defamation case against PERSON35, experts say. Now that the [ORGANIZATION]0 Pirates of the [LOCATION] star has told his side publicly, legal and PR professionals told [ORGANIZATION]7 a jury ruling in his favor doesnt matter as much. When PERSON34 stepped off the stand, I think he already won based on his definition of winning, said [LOCATION] civil attorney [PERSON]. Because he already obtained the favor of the [STREET] of public opinion once he told his story. 99 PERSON37 Announces Bid for Re-Election, [PERSON] in New Poll100 Rep. PERSON37 formally announced her bid for re-election [LOCATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]1 as the publication of a new poll that shows her 30 points behind her main Republican primary challenger. The survey conducted [ORGANIZATION]2 by [ORGANIZATION]8 reported that 56 of [ORGANIZATION]7 Republicans would vote for attorney PERSON38 while just 26 would back PERSON39. [ORGANIZATION]8, which has endorsed [ORGANIZATION]0, also found that 12 of voters are planning to back state Sen. [ORGANIZATION]1, while 6 are undecided. 101 Man Stabbed to Death by Door-to-Door Salesman During Fight, Authorities Say102 A [ORGANIZATION]3 [ORGANIZATION]8 man was stabbed to death [LOCATION]7 after trying to start a fight with a door-to-door salesman, authorities said. [ORGANIZATION]2, the DATE[ORGANIZATION]7 working for a company contracted by [ORGANIZATION]9 to solicit customers, has been charged with murder and two weapons offenses, [ORGANIZATION]0 said. The altercation took [STREET] shortly after the [ORGANIZATION]3 knocked on [ORGANIZATION]4 door, officials said. [ORGANIZATION]5 told [ORGANIZATION]3 he wasnt interested and the salesman left, according to the prosecutors office 103 Off-Duty Border Agent Rushed Into [PERSON]0 School With Borrowed Shotgun to Save Students104 [ORGANIZATION]6, who works as a [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION] agent and lives in [PERSON]0[LOCATION], got a chilling set of texts from his wife, a teacher at the now-famous [ORGANIZATION]. He rushed to the scene and aided in the rescue of several rooms full of children, including his own daughter, [ORGANIZATION]7. 105 Onlookers Urged Police to Charge Into [LOCATION] School106 GPE30, [LOCATION] AP  Frustrated onlookers urged police officers to charge into the [LOCATION] elementary school where a gunmans rampage killed 19 children and two teachers, witnesses said [ORGANIZATION]5, as investigators worked to track the massacre that lasted upwards of [TIME] and ended when the [ORGANIZATION]6 shooter was killed by a [ORGANIZATION]2 team. Go in there! Go in there! nearby women shouted at the officers soon after the attack began, said [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]7, who saw the scene from outside his house, across the [STREET] from [ORGANIZATION] School in the close-knit town of [PERSON]0. [ORGANIZATION]9 said the officers did not go in. PERSON50, whose fourth grade daughter, PERSON51, was killed in the attack, said he raced to the school when he heard about the shooting, arriving while police were still gathered outside the building. Upset that police were not moving in, he raised the idea of charging into the school with several other bystanders. Lets just rush in because the cops arent doing anything like they are supposed to, he said. More could have been done. They were unprepared, he added. [TIME], [ORGANIZATION]9 had watched as [PERSON] crashed his truck into a ditch outside the school, grabbed his AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle and shot at two people outside a nearby funeral home who ran away uninjured 107 Probe Finds No Link Between GPE31 School and Possible Tumor Cluster108 An investigation into a possible brain cancer cluster found no evidence a GPE31 school was the cause of tumors diagnosed in former students, officials declared [LOCATION]7. During a press conference, local and state officials said a probe into [ORGANIZATION]3, located in GPE32, found there was no cause and effect relationship between those illnesses and the building and grounds at [ORGANIZATION]3. [ORGANIZATION]8 we are very happy to announce that our extensive testing for both radon and radiation in the interior and exterior of the school building produced no evidence of cancer-causing hazards that warrant further investigation, said GPE32 Mayor [PERSON] during the press conference posted on the townships [PERSON] page. This is terrific news for the current students of [ORGANIZATION]3 and their parents, who worried about their safety, along with current staff members, and is also great news for all former students who attended and staff who worked at [ORGANIZATION]3. The investigation was jumpstarted after it was discovered more 122 people once connected to the school had a primary brain tumor and another 75 were diagnosed with other rare forms of cancer, according to [ORGANIZATION]4. 109 Prominent Journalists, [ORGANIZATION]s Fall for Hoax Claiming Gov. [PERSON] Paid [PERSON]0 Victims Families for Photo-Ops110 Left-wing activists and prominent journalists that write for liberal publications spread a hoax on [LOCATION]7 that [LOCATION] Governor Greg [PERSON] paid the families of the [PERSON]0, [LOCATION] shooting massacre victims for photo ops. The shocking false claims came from the ORG25 account [ORGANIZATION]5, which stated that following the [ORGANIZATION] School mass shooting, a representative for Governor [PERSON] showed up to his residence and attempted to coerce his family. The post has since gone viral. 111 PERSON56 [PERSON] a One World Government Its Not a Conspiracy Theory112 Senator PERSON56 appeared on [ORGANIZATION]6 [LOCATION]7 and discussed the ongoing ORG84 gathering in [ORGANIZATION], remarking that it is not a conspiracy theory to suggest the organisation is seeking a one world government, rather it is in their mission statement. PERSON57 urged that The real danger here thats even more dangerous than all their phony caring about carbon footprint, the real danger is this look how bad your government is in a country where you get to vote for these people. This would be a government, a world government where you dont get to vote on anybody.

For all the concern over foreign interference by certain politicians, this should be at the forefront of those conversations. Despite all of this, many are still relatively unworried about the [ORGANIZATION]7s activities. They believe that the aspirations of this group are far off pipedreams for some global movers and shakers, not locally influential realities but they are wrong.

buffalo,2018-07-05T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Buffalo News,homeless,[ORGANIZATION] not enforcing its fair housing law,"Most people would have let it go. But [ORGANIZATION] knew that refusing to rent to somebody because they receive Section 8 is a violation of [ORGANIZATION]s fair housing law. She filed a complaint with [ORGANIZATION], a local fair housing organization. [ORGANIZATION] undercover testing showed that what happened to her wasnt a one-off, and passed these findings on to the citys fair housing officer. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] is still waiting to hear back. [ORGANIZATION]s fair housing law6 was put in [STREET] to protect the thousands of city residents who rely on government assistance to pay their rent. But, in [LOCATION] since the law passed, the city has done little to enforce it, despite receiving at least 25 complaints like the one [ORGANIZATION] filed, most of them borne out by undercover testing - the gold standard in housing discrimination cases. In many cases, its unclear whether city officials even decided whether a landlord had violated the law. Those decisions, when they were made, were painfully slow. And even when a landlord was found to have discriminated, in most cases theres no indication that the city took any action against them. In [ORGANIZATION], one of the nations poorest cities, Section 8 is a lifeline for thousands of families. But an entire swath of the rental market is off limits to Section 8 tenants - not because they cant afford the rent, but because many landlords refuse to take their vouchers. The enforcement of this ordinance has been wholly insufficient and is a slap in the face to hardworking, lower-income families, said PERSON1, [ORGANIZATION] executive director. This demonstrates that fair housing is not a priority of this local government. [PERSON] said the city is very aggressive in pursuing fair housing cases, and that any cases that have not been resolved are pending. In fact, records show that city officials allowed many cases to sit, unresolved, for [ORGANIZATION] - then argued they couldnt do anything because the statute of limitations had expired. ORG2 was able to find only one case where the city took legal action against a landlord - and then only recently, after we began asking about the lack of enforcement. In most cases, city officials havent pursued out-of-[STREET] remedies, like bringing the parties together to work out a settlement, or making landlords take fair housing training, either. Case files have been lost. The position of fair housing officer has sat vacant for [ORGANIZATION] at a time. A [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] study7 concluded that the law has been a failure on substantive grounds due to the lack of implementation. The citys inaction gives landlords who discriminate little incentive to obey the law. In one case, a landlord had a message on their answering machine No smoking and no Section 8. In another, a landlord emailed one of [ORGANIZATION] testers, My ad on [LOCATION] states on the first line that I do not accept section 8 Good luck with your house hunt! Theres no record of the city taking action against either one. This story is based on a review of discrimination complaints referred to the city by [ORGANIZATION], emails and memos between city officials and fair housing advocates, and interviews with more than 30 people, including those who filed complaints and landlords who had complaints filed against them. PERSON3, whose wife owns the apartment [ORGANIZATION] looked at, said they dont discriminate against anyone. He wasnt sure if the case had been resolved, but said he hasnt heard anything from the city in [DATE]. Gloria [ORGANIZATION] filed a discrimination complaint with the city in DATE5. It still hasnt been resolved. Photo by PERSON5 For Gloria [ORGANIZATION], it wasnt just about this particular apartment, or this particular landlord. For her, Section 8 is a godsend. She remembers the relief she felt when she first received her voucher, after [ORGANIZATION] on the waiting list. She was taken aback at how many landlords wouldnt accept it. For somebody to just decide, well, Im not going to deal with you because you have that program thats assisting you, its ridiculous, she said.[PERSON] in the makingIt took [ORGANIZATION] almost four [ORGANIZATION] to pass a fair housing law. In DATE8, fair housing legislation twice won support on [ORGANIZATION], only to be vetoed, both times, by [PERSON]. At one tense public hearing, in DATE9, angry homeowners kept interrupting the bills authors as they tried to explain it. By this point, fair housing had become the third rail of [ORGANIZATION] politics and no one wanted to touch it, said [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] executive director for 35 [ORGANIZATION], until his retirement at the end of DATE5. It was 17 [ORGANIZATION] before [ORGANIZATION] would revisit the issue, [LOCATION]3 into [DATE] term as mayor. Even in [LOCATION]4, when the law finally passed, it was only by one vote. ORG7 Member [PERSON] denounced the proposed legislation as social engineering, telling The [ORGANIZATION] News he feared this kind of law would deny property owners the right to choose their tenants. I dont want to be forced to rent to scumbags who might live down the [STREET], he said.Stay informed Our [LOCATION]5 newsletter recaps our reporting and other must-read coverage of local issues. Delivered [LOCATION]6. In fact, nothing in the law prevents - or even discourages - landlords from screening tenants. An entire section of the law is dedicated to landlords rights. They can turn down anyone who cant afford the rent or whose neighbors have complained about them. They can check an applicants references, credit score and history of evictions. And, in a concession to smaller landlords, the law exempts owner-occupied doubles and triples, which make up a substantial portion of [ORGANIZATION]s housing stock. [ORGANIZATION]s fair housing ordinance goes further than state and federal law, which prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, and religion, among other categories, adding gender identity and lawful source of income - Section 8, [ORGANIZATION]0 benefits, housing assistance from [ORGANIZATION]1. But this comes with a catch victims of source of income discrimination cant take their complaints to state or federal agencies. Until recently, they could only go to the city. In [DATE], [PERSON] passed8 a fair housing law with similar source of income protections. Among those the law is meant to protect are the almost 9,000 households in [ORGANIZATION] - almost 20,000 people - who depend on Section 8 to help pay their rent, according to data from [ORGANIZATION]2. Almost 40 percent are families with children. [DATE] are elderly. Sixty-five percent are African American, as are almost all the people whove filed discrimination complaints. Refusing to rent to Section 8 recipients is often a subtler [STREET] of refusing to rent to black people, advocates say.Examples of discriminationIn theory, Section 8 - officially [ORGANIZATION] - allows recipients to live wherever they can afford the rent, giving them the chance to move out of distressed neighborhoods to places with more job opportunities, better schools and less crime. In reality, that choice is limited. Some neighborhoods are too expensive, even with a voucher. The average income of a Section 8 household is just 13,000 a year - less than half the city average. Voucher holders put roughly 30 percent of their [LOCATION]7 income towards the rent the subsidy covers the rest, up to a cap set by the federal government. Apartments have to pass an [LOCATION]8 safety inspection working heat and hot water, no fraying electrical wires, no broken windows or rotting porch steps. Some landlords complain that the inspections require jumping through too many bureaucratic hoops, and that repairs are costly. There are benefits for landlords, though. Theyre guaranteed to receive the portion of rent covered by the subsidy [LOCATION]9, via direct deposit. And the program creates a safety net if a voucher holder loses their job, for instance, the rental assistance increases. Still, many landlords flatly refuse to take Section 8. Scrolling through rental listings online, a voucher holder will find dozens that tell her to keep looking no rental assistance, no pets, no Section 8! DOES NOT ACCEPT SECTION 8. Other landlords accept Section 8, but selectively, steering voucher holders to certain neighborhoods. At [ORGANIZATION]3, one of the citys biggest landlords, property managers said the companys two stately apartment buildings on [ORGANIZATION], near FAC1, were not Section 8 approved, according to one complaint. Instead, they suggested a shabbier residential complex in a neighborhood where the poverty rate is almost twice as high. The case against [ORGANIZATION]4 is still unresolved through an attorney, the company declined to comment. [ORGANIZATION]3 refused to accept Section 8 at this apartment building on [ORGANIZATION]. Photo by [ORGANIZATION], they suggested a more modest residential complex in a poorer neighborhood. Photo by PERSON5 The wait for a voucher lasts [ORGANIZATION]. Demand for the program far outstrips the federal funding available. None of [ORGANIZATION]s Section 8 agencies is currently taking new applications. Once off the waiting list, new voucher holders have a window of time - [ORGANIZATION]0, depending on the agency - to use the voucher, or risk losing it altogether. As rents rise, this is becoming more common. At [ORGANIZATION]5, one of the citys Section 8 agencies, almost a quarter of the people coming off the waiting list lost their vouchers [ORGANIZATION]1 - a sharp increase, managers say. [PERSON] found herself in this position after a property management company refused to take her voucher at an apartment in South [ORGANIZATION]. She had been turned down because of her Section 8 twice already, she told [ORGANIZATION]. With time running out, all I wanted to do was get into that apartment and pretty much save my [ORGANIZATION]6, she said, referring to her Section 8. Instead, she said, she lost her voucher. Its been more than three [ORGANIZATION] since the city concluded that she had been discriminated against. In that time, the company she filed the complaint against has closed down. One of the final entries in her case file notes that, [ORGANIZATION]3, the fair housing officer said her complaint was still being worked on.Inept city bureaucracyMost of [ORGANIZATION] case files tell a similar story a complaint is filed, substantiated by testing and sent to the city. Then, phone calls to city officials go unreturned, excuses are made, [ORGANIZATION]4 pass, and the case fizzles out. Almost every step of the citys process for handling discrimination complaints has broken down at some point. Stack them all up and the pile of complaints isnt that large. Voucher holders and advocates say discrimination is pervasive, but it goes mostly unreported, national research shows. Between [LOCATION]4, when the law went into effect, and the end of [ORGANIZATION]1, the city received at least 25 complaints - roughly two a year. By the time the city receives a complaint, [ORGANIZATION] has already done most of the investigative work. Its then up to the citys fair housing officer to determine whether theres probable cause that discrimination occurred. In 10 cases, the citys sloppy record keeping makes it unclear whether this ever happened. In response to a Freedom of Information request, the city provided records for just four complaints, none of them complete. Several cases were abandoned after the person who filed the complaint lost touch with [ORGANIZATION], or, in one instance, became homeless. Findings of discrimination, when they do come, take almost three times longer, on average, than [ORGANIZATION]7 the law allows. If a landlord is found to have discriminated, the fair housing officer is supposed to bring the parties together for settlement talks. In many cases, theres no record of this happening, according to a review of [ORGANIZATION] case files. One landlord told ORG2 she settled her case for 20, with no requirement that she attend fair housing training - although she acknowledged that she hadnt known about the law. [ORGANIZATION], which filed the complaint after finding an ad she had posted on [LOCATION], for a classy, comfy home saying sorry, no section 8 applicants accepted, was never informed of the settlement. If the landlord isnt willing to settle, the fair housing officer is supposed to send the complaint to the citys law department, which can take legal action seeking to impose fines or revoke rental licenses. In roughly a third of cases, the city has apparently failed to take action even after finding that a landlord has violated the law, [ORGANIZATION] records show. This reluctance is all the more striking given that the city pays [ORGANIZATION] to investigate discrimination complaints, spending scarce federal grant money on work that goes unused. Its very frustrating to tell folks that this is what the law says, but the citys not enforcing it, said PERSON11, [ORGANIZATION] associate director and staff attorney. As more time goes by, theres less and less chance that folks will ever receive justice in a lot of these cases. PERSON12, the citys fair housing officer since [PERSON], says the complaint process works well. He disagreed that some cases never receive determinations, but refused to provide specifics. PERSON13 and PERSON14, when they served as state Attorney General, took action10 against several landlords11 who turned Section 8 recipients away. The city, by contrast, has apparently taken legal action against a landlord only once, records and interviews show, and only after ORG2 began making inquiries. In [DATE] DATE5, PERSON15 was evicted from an apartment in South [ORGANIZATION] after her landlords told her, via text message, that they would not fill out her Section 8 paperwork. The city took seven [ORGANIZATION]4 to reach a finding of discrimination. Reached by phone, PERSON16, who owns the property with his wife, declined to comment, saying the complaint was bogus. After settlement talks fell apart [ORGANIZATION]3, PERSON17 didnt hear from the city for [ORGANIZATION]4. She wondered if filing the complaint had been worth it. Finally, in [ORGANIZATION]1, city attorneys filed a lawsuit against the PERSON18, seeking 4,500 in fines and a [ORGANIZATION]2 suspension of their rental licenses. For victims of discrimination, the stakes are high, and when the city fails to act, they have few options. The law gives them the right to take legal action against a landlord independently, but going to [STREET] is costly and time-consuming. Only one case has so far been resolved this [STREET]. After [ORGANIZATION]7 refused to take her voucher at an apartment in North [ORGANIZATION], PERSON19 rushed to find somewhere else before she ran out of time, according to an affidavit filed in the case. The [STREET] shed wanted was close to the shops and restaurants of FAC2. Instead, she ended up in an apartment building on [PERSON], on [ORGANIZATION], where the hallways smelled of sewage and were littered with used condoms, she said in the affidavit. The police were often called to the building on drug raids, sometimes breaking down apartment doors. She could hear sounds and fights related to prostitution through the thin apartment walls. In [ORGANIZATION]3, a state [ORGANIZATION]8 judge awarded PERSON20 almost 10,000 in damages. The city never decided whether she had been discriminated against.Shortcomings documentedIts not news to the PERSON21 administration that the fair housing law has gone almost entirely unenforced. A [ORGANIZATION]4 report by [ORGANIZATION] found inconsistent staffing of key positions related to fair housing. In [ORGANIZATION], a study by researchers at [ORGANIZATION]9 noted that no records of fines, civil penalties, or other enforcement actions have been maintained since the adoption of the ordinance. In [ORGANIZATION]5, the citys own federally required fair housing plan registered12 concerns that the law was mostlysymbolic and warned13 of limited funding, limited political will and a lack of coordination within and across various agencies The city has never filed the [LOCATION]8 reports on its fair housing caseload that the law requires. A landlord training manual14 on the citys website doesnt mention the laws key provision. A link to a discrimination complaint form takes [ORGANIZATION] to a ORG20 form, although federal law doesnt include source of income protections. Many landlords say they dont know about the law, and the city doesnt take advantage of obvious opportunities to educate them. ORG21 is supposed to ensure that owners of apartment buildings certify that theyre fully aware of the law. A process to do so was never put in [STREET], one city official said. The city requires smaller landlords to register their rental properties, but doesnt tell them about the fair housing law during the sign-up process, according to city officials and registered landlords. PERSON22, the fair housing officer, said he distributes copies of the law at the citys foreclosure auctions. Three [ORGANIZATION] ago, frustrated at the citys inaction, fair housing advocates tried to make the case for enforcing the law in person, emails and memos show. But the first city attorney they met with, in [PERSON], was reassigned, soon afterwards, to traffic [STREET]. A second attorney told them that [ORGANIZATION]7 that hed been given the go-ahead to take legal action in one of the cases, but - after several [ORGANIZATION]4 of confusion - they learned he had left to work for the [ORGANIZATION] Board of Education. By [DATE] of DATE5, city attorneys had bad news. Many of the complaints were now more than three [ORGANIZATION] old too old to prosecute, they argued, because the statute of limitations had expired. The housing advocates were dismayed. The city had sat on these cases for [ORGANIZATION], and now the lawyers were saying it was too late to act on them. After setting new deadlines for the more recent cases, a third attorney assigned to work on fair housing left. PERSON23 filed a complaint against ORG23 .... in [DATE]1, and city records show the fair housing officer found probable cause of discrimination. ORG23 representatives denied the allegations in a meeting with the city, according to [ORGANIZATION] case file. While the records show that the fair housing officer referred the case to the corporation counsels office, theres no indication the city took any formal enforcement action. After [ORGANIZATION] of following up and waiting, PERSON24 stopped calling [ORGANIZATION] to ask about her complaint, not wanting to be a nuisance. It wasnt the first time she had been turned down because of her voucher, and it wouldnt be the last. I could make 10 phone calls right now, she said, and at least six of them would come back and say, No Section 8.

buffalo,2021-04-24T00:00:00Z,Dissident Voice,WBFO,"homeless, homelessness",Economic Collapse Continues Uninterrupted,"The assault on economic science and coherence is intense. Working in concert, and contrary to the lived experience of millions of people, many newspapers are declaring miraculous economic growth rates for country after country. According to the rich and their media, numerous countries are experiencing or are on the cusp of experiencing very strong come-backs or complete recoveries. Very high rates of [ORGANIZATION] economic growth, generally not found in any prior period, are being floated regularly. The numbers defy common sense. In reality, economic and social problems are getting worse nationally and internationally. Getting back to the pre-ORG31 standard will take time, said1 PERSON0, the [ORGANIZATION] chief economist. The aftermath of ORG31 isnt going to reverse for a lot of countries. Far from it. _ftn1 Even this recent statement is misleading because it implies that pre-ORG31 economic conditions were somehow good or acceptable when things have actually been going downhill for [LOCATION]. Most economies never really recovered from the economic collapse of DATE2. Most countries are still running on gas fumes while poverty, unemployment, under-employment, inequality, debt, food insecurity, generalized anxiety, and other problems keep worsening. And [ORGANIZATION], with millions of people fully vaccinated and trillions of phantom dollars, euros, and yen printed by the worlds central banks, there is still no real and sustained stability, prosperity, security, or harmony. People everywhere are still anxious about the future. Pious statements from world leaders about fixing capitalism have done nothing to reverse the global economic decline that started [PERSON] and was intensified by the [PERSON] Pandemic. In the [ORGANIZATION] alone, in real numbers, about 3-4 million people a month have been laid off for [PERSON]. At no other time in [ORGANIZATION] history has such a calamity on this scale happened. This has improved slightly recently but the number of people being laid off [ORGANIZATION] remains extremely high and troubling. In [PERSON], for example the statewide official unemployment rate remains the second highest in the country at just under 9. One [LOCATION] after the start of the pandemic and the recession it caused, most of the jobs GPE2 lost still have not come back. emphasis added, DATE8 In addition, nationally the number of long-term unemployed remains [PERSON] and the labor force participation rate remains low4. And most new jobs that are created are not high-paying jobs with good benefits and security. The so-called [ORGANIZATION] has beleaguered millions. Some groups have been more adversely affected than others. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] News amp38 World Report conveyed that In [LOCATION]0, right before the coronavirus was declared a pandemic by ORG2, Black women had an employment to population ratio of 60.8 that now stands at 54.8, a drop of 6 percentage points. The obsolete [ORGANIZATION] economic system has discarded more than half a million black women from the labor force in the past [LOCATION]. In [LOCATION]2, around the time the [PERSON] Pandemic began to emerge, ORG3 reported5 that An estimated 53 million people44 percent of all [ORGANIZATION] workers [LOCATION]3 low-wage workers. Thats more than twice the number of people in the 10 most populous [ORGANIZATION] cities combined. Their median [TIME] wage is [DATE], and their median [ORGANIZATION] earnings are 17,950. _ftn5 ORG4 reports6 that 37 percent of [ORGANIZATION]s in [LOCATION]4 did not have 400 to cover an unanticipated emergency._ftn6 In [LOCATION], 1 out of 5 families [ORGANIZATION] are living at the poverty level. _ftn7Sadly, 60 of [ORGANIZATION]s will live below the official poverty line8 for at least one [LOCATION] of their lives. While [ORGANIZATION] billionaires9 became 1.3 trillion richer, about 8 million [ORGANIZATION]s joined the ranks of the poor during the [PERSON] Pandemic. And more inflation will make things worse for more people. A [LOCATION]6 headline from ORG5 reads10 The price of food and gas is creeping higher  and will stay that [STREET] for a while. _ftn10 ORG6 goes further in [ORGANIZATION] and says11 that the post-pandemic economy will include higher prices, worse service, longer [PERSON] in the [ORGANIZATION] is also increasing [PERSON]-driven loss of jobs and employment income will cause the number of homeless workers to increase each [LOCATION] through [LOCATION]8. Without large-scale, government employment programs the Pandemic Recession is [PERSON] to cause twice as much homelessness as the DATE2 Great Recession. Over [DATE] [LOCATION]s the current Pandemic Recession is projected to cause chronic homelessness to increase 49 percent in [LOCATION], 68 percent in [LOCATION] and 86 percent in [LOCATION]. The homeless include the homeless on the streets, shelter residents and couch surfers. emphasis added, DATE20 Perhaps ironically, just Two blocks from FAC0, a growing encampment of the homeless13 grips the economys most powerful person ORORG28 Chairman [PERSON]. Officially, about four million businesses, including more than 110,000 restaurants, have permanently closed14 in the [ORGANIZATION] over DATE21. In [ORGANIZATION] ORG8 stated15 that, roughly 80,000 stores are doomed to close in [DATE] [LOCATION]s as the retail apocalypse continues to rip through GPE7. The real figure is likely higher. Bankruptcies16 have also risen in some sectors. For example, bankruptcies by North [ORGANIZATION] oil producers rose to the highest DATE23 level since 2016._ftn16 In [LOCATION]6 ORG9 reported17 that more than 25 million workers are directly harmed by the [PERSON] labor market. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are more than 100 applicants for each job opening in some sectors. Given the depth and breadth of the economic collapse in the [ORGANIZATION], it is no surprise that 1 in 6 [ORGANIZATION]s went into therapy18 for the first time in [PERSON]. The number of people affected by depression, anxiety, addiction, and suicide worldwide as a direct result of the long depression is very high. These harsh facts and realities are also linked to more violence, killings, protests, demonstrations, social unrest, and riots worldwide. In terms of physical health19, Sixty-one percent of [ORGANIZATION] adults report undesired weight changes since the [PERSON]-19 pandemic began. This will only exacerbate the diabetes pandemic that has been ravaging more countries every [LOCATION]. On another front, ORG10 informs [ORGANIZATION] that, as a result of the economic collapse that has unfolded over the past [LOCATION], A majority of young adults in the [ORGANIZATION] live with their parents for the first time since the Great Depression. And it does not help that student debt21 now exceeds 1.7 trillion and is still climbing rapidly. _ftn21 [ORGANIZATION] of college faculty have also suffered greatly over the past [LOCATION]. A recent survey22 by the [ORGANIZATION] Association of University Professors ORG12 found that real wages for full-time faculty decreased for the first time since the Great Recessionin DATE2, and average wage growth for all ranks of full-time faculty was the lowest since the ORG12 began tracking [ORGANIZATION] wage growth in [DATE]. After adjusting for inflation, real wages decreased at over two-thirds of colleges and universities. The number of full-time faculty decreased at over half of institutions. _ftn22 This does not account for the thousands of higher education adjuncts part-time faculty and staff that lost their jobs permanently. In [ORGANIZATION], ORG13 stated23 that, millions of people are still without their pre-pandemic income sources and are borrowing to get by. Specifically 54 million adults said they didnt use regular income sources like those received before the pandemic to meet their spending needs in DATE27. 50 million used credit cards or loans to meet spending needs. 20 million borrowed from friends or family. These three groups overlap. _ftn23 Also in [ORGANIZATION], ORG14 wrote24 The pandemics disruption has created inescapable financial strain for many [ORGANIZATION]s. Nearly 2 of 5 of adults have postponed major financial decisions, from buying cars or houses to getting married or having children, due to the coronavirus crisis, according to a survey DATE28 from [PERSON]. Among younger adults, DATE29, some 59 percent said they had delayed a financial milestone. emphasis added According to ORG16 The [ORGANIZATION] economy has seen a long-term decline in capacity utilization in manufacturing, which has averaged 78 percent from [DATE] to [LOCATION]4well below levels that stimulate net investment. emphasis added, [ORGANIZATION]1 Capitalist firms will not invest in new ventures or projects when there is little or no profit to be made, which is why major owners of capital are engaged in even more stock market manipulation than ever before. Casino capitalism is intensifying. This, in turn, is giving rise to even larger stock market bubbles that will eventually burst and wreak even more havoc than previous stock market crashes. The inability to make profit through normal investment channels is also why major owners of capital are imposing more public-private partnerships PPPs on people and society through neoliberal state restructuring. Such pay-the-rich schemes further marginalize workers and exacerbate inequality, debt, and poverty. PPPs solve no problems and must be replaced by human-centered economic arrangements. ORG17 estimates26 that the equivalent of 255 million full-time jobs have been lost globally as a result of government actions over [ORGANIZATION]2. In [DATE] of this [LOCATION], ORG18 of GPE8 reported27 that, [ORGANIZATION] hunger is set to soar in over 20 countries in [ORGANIZATION]4 without urgent and scaled-up assistance. The ORG19 says, 8217The magnitude of suffering is alarming. And according to [LOCATION], Overall, global [ORGANIZATION] had collapsed in [PERSON], falling by 42 to an estimated 859 billion, from 1.5 trillion in [LOCATION]4, according to the ORG21 report. ORG21 stands for ORG22. The international organization ORG23 [PERSON] us that The coronavirus pandemic has the potential to lead to an increase in inequality in almost every country at once, the first time this has happened since records began. Billionaire fortunes returned to their pre-pandemic highs in [ORGANIZATION]5, while recovery for the worlds poorest people could take [DATE]. emphasis added, [ORGANIZATION]6 According to [PERSON], The [PERSON]-19 pandemic has pushed about 120 million people into extreme poverty over the last [LOCATION] in mostly low- and middle-income countries. And despite the roll-out of vaccines in various countries the economic implications of the pandemic are deep and far-reaching. It is ushering in a new poor profile that is more urban, better educated, and reliant on informal sector work such as construction, relative to the existing global poor those living on [ORGANIZATION]8 who are more rural and heavily reliant on agriculture. emphasis added Another source notes30 that ORG25, using ORG26 data, has estimated that the number of poor in [LOCATION] with income of [DATE] or less in purchasing power parity has more than doubled from 60 million to 134 million in just a [LOCATION] due to the pandemic-induced recession. This means, [LOCATION] is back in a situation to be called a country of mass poverty after 45 [LOCATION]s. emphasis added_ftn31 In [ORGANIZATION], there is no end in sight to the economic decline that keeps unfolding. [PERSON]0, for example, [PERSON] its worst economy in literally 300 [LOCATION]s The economy in the [PERSON]1 contracted 9.9 percent in [PERSON], the worst [LOCATION] on record since [PERSON]2, ORG27 ONS said in a report on [PERSON]3 [PERSON]4. The overall economic drop in [PERSON] was more than double in [PERSON]5, when [PERSON]1 GDP declined 4.1 percent due to the worldwide financial crisis. [PERSON]2 experienced the biggest [ORGANIZATION] decline among the ORG28 economies  [PERSON]3 saw its economy decline 8.3 percent, [PERSON]4 dropped 8.8 percent, [PERSON]5 declined 5 percent and the [ORGANIZATION] contracted 3.5 percent. emphasis added_ftn32 Another source also notes32 that, The ORG29 is being haunted by ghost bankruptcies, with more than 200,000 firms across the [ORGANIZATION]an Unions four biggest nations under threat when ORG31 financial lifelines stop. In another sign of economic decline, this time in [LOCATION], ORG32 reported33 in [ORGANIZATION] that Japans [PERSON]-21 crude steel output fell to a 52-[LOCATION] low._ftn34 Taken alone, on a country-by-country basis, these are not minor economic downturns, but when viewed as a collective cumulative global phenomenon, the consequences are more serious. It is a big problem when numerous economies decline simultaneously. The world is more interdependent and interconnected than ever. What happens in one region necessarily affects other regions. One could easily go country by country and region by region and document many tragic economic developments that are still unfolding and worsening. [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8, [PERSON]9, [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], GPE23, GPE24, and dozens of other countries are all experiencing major economic setbacks and hardships that will take [LOCATION]s to overcome and will negatively affect the economies of other countries in an increasingly interdependent world. And privatization schemes around the world are just making conditions worse for the majority of people. Far from solving any problems, neoliberalism has made everything worse for working people and society. It is too soon for capitalist ideologues to be euphoric about miraculous economic growth and success. There is no meaningful evidence to show that there is deep, significant, sustained economic growth on a broad scale. There is tremendous economic carnage and pain out there, and the scarring and consequences are going to linger for some time. No one believes that a big surge of well-paying jobs is right around the corner. Nor does anyone believe that more schemes to pay the rich under the banner of high ideals will improve things either. Relentless disinformation about the economy wont solve any problems or convince people that they are not experiencing what they are experiencing. Growing poverty, hunger, homelessness, unemployment, under-employment, debt, inequality, anxiety, and insecurity are real and painful. They require real solutions put forward by working people, not major owners of capital concerned only with maximizing private profit as fast as possible. The economy cannot improve and serve a pro-social aim and direction so long as those who produce societys wealth, workers, are disempowered and denied any control of the economy they run. Allowing major decisions to be made by a historically superfluous financial oligarchy is not the [STREET] forward. The rich and their representatives are unfit to rule and have no real solutions for the recurring crises caused by their outmoded system. They are focused mainly on depriving people of an outlook that opens the path of progress to society. There is no [STREET] for the massive wealth of society to be used to serve the general interests of society so long as the contradiction between the socialized nature of the economy and its continued domination by competing private interests remain unresolved. All we are left with are recurring economic crises that take a bigger and bigger toll on humanity. To add insult to injury, we are told that there is no alternative to this outdated system, and that the goal is to strive for inclusive capitalism, ethical capitalism, responsible capitalism, or some other oxymoron. But there is an alternative. Existing conditions do not have to be eternal or tolerated. History shows that conditions that favor the people can be established. The rich must be deprived of their ability to deprive the people of their rights, including the right to govern their own affairs and control the economy. The economy, government, nation-building, and society must be controlled and directed by the people themselves, free of the influence of narrow private interests determined to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone and everything else. The rich and their political and media representatives are under great pressure to distort social consciousness, undermine the human factor, and block progress. The necessity for change is for humanity to rise up and usher in a modern society that ensures prosperity, stability, and peace for all. It can be done and must be done._ftnref22_ftnref23_ftnref28 The post Economic Collapse Continues Uninterrupted34 first appeared on ORG33.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19 text612520of20[ORGANIZATION]s20Say20They20Gained20Weight20During20the20Pandemic,-Written20by20Meaganamp38textSixty2Done20percent20of20[ORGANIZATION],consumption20are20all20contributing20factors.  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27 textThe20report27s20hunger20projections20are20based20on20the,Food20Crises20to20be20issued20in20April[PERSON]21.

[ORGANIZATION], a [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], detective was fired3 for expressing mild support online for [ORGANIZATION]. Youll notice that most self-proclaimed good cops never seem to know any bad cops. Theyll also swear theyve never witnessed police brutality or racial discrimination on the job. They all work in [ORGANIZATION], apparently. Even if a cop isnt inclined to grotesque violence like PERSON4 or PERSON9, theres no incentive to speak out or dare stop them. The police union is more protective of killer cops than selfless ones like [PERSON]. Dr. [PERSON] once said, The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.

From ORG3 The legal system can at the very least be a mechanism to help justice prevail, even if belatedly, the judge, [ORGANIZATION] PERSON11, wrote. His ruling also invoked the deaths of Mr. PERSON12 and PERSON13, a [ORGANIZATION] man from [PERSON] whose dying words  I cant breathe  have become a national rallying cry against police brutality7.I cant breathe are relevant and potent words here, because [PERSON] was moved to act in DATE5 when she heard PERSON14 say he couldnt breathe.

I do think [LOCATION] Law sounds better than [ORGANIZATION], which is what I imagine most [PERSON] cops call the law at home. There are also whistleblower protections, which should encourage more cops to do the right thing. However, a tremendous culture change is needed.

buffalo,2020-12-10T00:00:00Z,VentureBeat,WGRZ,homeless,[ORGANIZATION] votes to prohibit businesses from using facial recognition without public notice,"In the wake of the ORG0 movement, an increasing number of cities and states have expressed concerns about facial recognition technology and its applications. [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], GPE2 and [PERSON], [PERSON] are among the metros where law enforcement is prohibited from using facial recognition. In [PERSON], companies must get consent before collecting biometric information of any kind, including face images. GPE6 recently passed2 a moratorium on the use of biometric identification in schools until [ORGANIZATION], and lawmakers in [PERSON] have advanced a suspension3 of government use of any biometric surveillance system within the commonwealth. More recently, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] approved a ballot initiative banning the use of facial recognition by police and city agencies. The GPE6 City Council bill, which was sponsored by [PERSON]0 Councilman PERSON0, doesnt outright ban the use of facial recognition technologies by businesses. However, it does impose restrictions on the ways brick-and-mortar locations like retailers, which might use facial recognition to prevent theft or personalize certain services, can deploy it. Businesses that fail to post a warning about collecting biometric data must pay 500. Businesses found selling data will face fines of 5,000. In this aspect, the bill falls short of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] recently-passed ordinance regarding biometric data collection, which bans all private use of biometric data in places of public accommodation, including stores, banks, restaurants, public transit stations, homeless shelters, doctors offices, rental properties, retirement homes, and a variety of other types of businesses excepting workplaces_. Its scheduled to take effect starting DATE1. I commend ORG2 for protecting GPE6ers from facial recognition and other biometric tracking. No one should have to risk being profiled by a racist algorithm just for buying milk at the neighborhood store, [PERSON], executive director of [ORGANIZATION], said. While this is just a first step towards comprehensively banning biometric surveillance, its a crucial one. We shouldnt allow giant companies to sell our biometric data simply because we want to buy necessities. Far too many companies use biometric surveillance systems to profile customers of color, even though they are biased. If companies dont comply with the new law, we have a simple message well see you in [STREET]. Numerous studies and [PERSON] ownanalyses4of public benchmark data have shown facial recognition algorithms are susceptible to bias. One issue is that the data sets used to train the algorithms skew white and male. [ORGANIZATION]found5that 81 of people in the three face-image collections most widely cited in academic studies have lighter-colored skin. Academics have found that photographic technology and techniques can also favor lighter skin, including everything from sepia-tinged film to low-contrast digital cameras. The algorithms are often misused in the field, as well, which tends to amplify their underlying biases. Areport6from [ORGANIZATION] details how police feed facial recognition software flawed data, including composite sketches and pictures of celebrities who share physical features with suspects. The GPE6 [INSTITUTION] and othersreportedly7edit photos with blur effects and 3D modelers to make them more conducive to algorithmic face searches. ORG7, [ORGANIZATION], and ORG9 have self-imposed moratoriums on the sale of facial recognition systems. But some vendors, like [ORGANIZATION]0 and [PERSON]1-based [ORGANIZATION]1, are aiming to fill the gap with customers, including [PERSON]2 and [ORGANIZATION]2.  1 38utm_mediumnov-19-sidebaramp38utm_contenttext-linkamp38utm_campaigndec-10-logmein-webinar  2  3  4  5  6  7"

In [LOCATION], the parties signed a community benefits [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION], that outlined who would get jobs and contracts during and after construction, how much those jobs would pay, what the project would look like, and how the city and its residents would share in the profits generated by the new arena. The [ORGANIZATION] also committed 100 million to fund housing, education and other social and infrastructure improvement programs identified by community groups and elected officials. Other cities negotiating the construction of new sports arenas have used ORG7, too. ORG2 earmarked 40 million for parks and a job training center7, among other programs. A coalition of community groups got ORG3 to pay for a new grocery [ORGANIZATION] in a largely African-American community that lacked one. [ORGANIZATION] agreed to hire at least half the workers at their new arena from the citys poorest neighborhoods and pay them a living wage9. A [ORGANIZATION] is a legally binding agreement between developers and community groups that ensures projects receiving public dollars will improve local neighborhoods and the lives of local residents, according to [ORGANIZATION], executive director of [ORGANIZATION], a [ORGANIZATION]-based think tank. Really at the core is this principle that for public investment, or public subsidies, surrounding communities should see community benefits return to them, [PERSON] said. More than 350 such agreements have been won by community groups and lawmakers across the country over DATE2, according to [ORGANIZATION], who has advised numerous [ORGANIZATION] campaigns, including two here in [ORGANIZATION]. Donate to support our nonprofit newsroom12 The [ORGANIZATION] movement was born in [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] told [PERSON], then quickly spread to big cities like GPE2, [PERSON] and [PERSON], as well as mid-sized cities such as [PERSON], [LOCATION] and GPE7, to name just a few. Many ORG7, though not all, have been attached to professional sports arenas and the entertainment districts built around them. There are almost always significant public investments in such projects, [ORGANIZATION] said, in the form of tax abatements, grants of public money or land, or infrastructure work That means that we, the public, are investors in the project, he said. And so we are entitled to be part of the team negotiating the deal. Thus far, the negotiations for construction of a new [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]7 stadium have unfolded behind closed doors13, between state and county officials and the teams owners, with virtually no public insight or input. Nor can the [ORGANIZATION] movement claim any clear victories in [LOCATION]. [PERSON] hopes that will change when a proposal comes out of the negotiating room and is sent to [PERSON] and GPE2 state legislators for approval. She said a coalition has formed to promote a [ORGANIZATION] proposal, which is being championed by [ORGANIZATION]0 Senator [PERSON] and [PERSON] Legislature Chair PERSON5. In an interview with the local podcast [ORGANIZATION]1 DATE4, [PERSON] called public subsidies for professional sports arenas a small tragedy, given that stadiums provide virtually zero economic benefit to a community once theyre built. Why in the world are taxpayers paying for stadiums? [PERSON] said, adding that a [ORGANIZATION] was the best [STREET] to ensure the public received some return on its investment. ORG7 across the country The first ORG7 were driven by labor unions, according to [ORGANIZATION], who became involved with the movement as a labor organizer in [LOCATION]. In [PERSON], he said, ORG7 have expanded to address broader community needs, such as affordable housing, education and health equity. This is not just, you know, labor unions thinking about how theyre going to get more jobs, he said. Its also engaging the community in a very real [STREET] to address important community needs. The [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] included benchmarks for local hiring and contracting, engaging minority- and women-owned businesses, and paying a living wage to workers during and after construction  the baseline considerations typical of most ORG7. Follow us on Facebook15, Twitter16 and YouTube17 On top of that, the [ORGANIZATION] - who began play as the [ORGANIZATION] Braves18 DATE6 - committed 100 million to address some of GPE9 most pressing needs, including 75 million to start a revolving loan fund to support affordable housing projects. 12.25 million for college scholarships, tutoring, counseling and other educational programs. 6 million to improve the citys [INSTITUTION] and build a new [INSTITUTION]. 3 million in rental and legal assistance for people struggling to avoid eviction. 2.5 million to aid first-time homebuyers. Three-quarters of that money will seed a revolving loan fund for affordable housing projects. The rest will pay for educational programs and college scholarships, build a new library and [INSTITUTION], and provide assistance for renters facing eviction and aid to first-time homebuyers, among other initiatives. Among the first ORG7 was a DATE7 agreement19 reached between a coalition of community groups and the developers of an entertainment district surrounding FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION]. That arena continues to host the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]3 of the [ORGANIZATION]4 and the [ORGANIZATION]5 of [ORGANIZATION]6. In exchange for 150 million in public subsidies, the developers agreed that at least 70 percent of the jobs created by the project would pay a living wage. They committed to a first source hiring program, ensuring job opportunities would be offered to local, low-income communities, including those displaced by the project. The agreement also included an affordable housing component, as well as commitments to using local contractors and leasing commercial space to local businesses. Further, the developers agreed to fund a study of the surrounding communitys parks and recreation facilities and commit 1 million to improving them. Agreements in mid-sized cities [PERSON] described some benefits other municipalities have won as examples of what [LOCATION] taxpayers might seek in negotiations with the [ORGANIZATION]7 In DATE8, an alliance of [ORGANIZATION]0 community groups negotiated a [ORGANIZATION] with the developers of FAC1, a 7-acre development around the citys [ORGANIZATION]8 stadium thats home to the [ORGANIZATION]9. The developers committed to environmentally friendly design standards and building practices, in addition to baseline demands for local hiring and living-wage jobs. In [PERSON], when ORG3 of the ORG20 wanted to build a new arena, a coalition of more than 100 community groups won 8.3 million in funding for neighborhood projects, including a grocery store  an amenity the largely African-American [PERSON] lacked. In [LOCATION]0, the [LOCATION] Bucks signed a [ORGANIZATION] for a new arena that included living wage and local hiring guarantees that extended past the construction period to cover the service and retail jobs the project would create over the long term. In [LOCATION]1, the [PERSON] Falcons opened a new 1.5 billion stadium. The teams owner avoided a legally binding [ORGANIZATION] but agreed to invest more than 40 million in parks, a job center, housing and social programs. In [LOCATION]2, GPE7 officials agreed to pay for a 275 million stadium for the citys new ORG23 team with a [ORGANIZATION] that provides for affordable housing and a childcare facility on the development site, as well as retail spaces for local artisans and small businesses at a reduced rental rate. All those projects involved public subsidies. And then theres the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] sought little in the [STREET] of public money. The project is privately owned and, for the most part, privately financed. [PERSON] noted that the [ORGANIZATION] was finalized as the first wave of the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic underlined the fragility of at-risk populations who deal disproportionately with poor access to healthcare, quality housing and educational opportunities. She said it should provide a template for a [ORGANIZATION] with the [ORGANIZATION]7, who expect significant subsidies for a new stadium in [ORGANIZATION]1.

The main impetus for the initiative had originated in long-standing grievances of some ethnic groups living within [ORGANIZATION]an Union member states, as well as [ORGANIZATION]4 candidate countries.

Appealing to centrist so-called constructors who could replace PERSON80, the premier called for the limpid backing of liberals, popular party members and socialists. PERSON81 said former premier [ORGANIZATION]7 whom he blamed for a grave act of irresponsibility had opened a crisis that must find in this forum its clarification with transparency with respect to the clear action which marked my mandate. PERSON81 is seeking enough so-called constructors to replace PERSON80 crucially in the ORG94 where he no longer has a majority and where he will face the second of the two confidence votes on [ORGANIZATION]. We need the widest possible consensus among willing forces, PERSON81 said as he addressed the possible constructors who could save his executive. PERSON81 said the crisis had dissipated energies in sterile polemics that it was without any foundation, and that the government had improved the [PERSON] Recovery Plan which [ORGANIZATION]7 had cited as the reason for his defection. He said the use of the [ORGANIZATION]an Stability Mechanism for health spending doesnt come into it. The premier said the crisis had damaged the country, and what has happened cannot be cancelled, effectively rebuffing [ORGANIZATION]7s tentative overtures to do a U-turn and return to the administration he brought down. PERSON81 said GPE52 deserves a cohesive government and called on lawmakers to now help it turn the page. He said the Recovery Plan would be a collective and shared effort. PERSON81 said that his aim was to continue to bring about reform, From the start I worked for the creation of the prospect of a board, courageous design for DATE51 of reform based on sustainability, social and territorial cohesion and the full development of the human person, PERSON81 said as he appealed to the lawmakers to back his executive, That vision is still present [ORGANIZATION]6.

The premier faces the first of two crunch confidence votes in the lower chamber, with an even stiffer test coming in the ORG94 on [ORGANIZATION] if his executive survives in the ORG70 on [ORGANIZATION]. He is set to appeal to so-called constructor lawmakers from outside the ruling coalition to vote for the government and stop it collapsing in the middle of the [PERSON]-10 pandemic. The two senior partners in the ruling coalition, ORG96 and the centre-left [PERSON] ORG98, have already rejected the idea of patching things up with ex-premier [ORGANIZATION]7. But the ORG98 has kept the door open to individual PERSON80 lawmakers and two have said that they will break ranks from the centrist group. The centre-right opposition has called for snap elections, arguing that, even if the government survives the confidence votes, if will be too weak to effectively rule the country. Life Senator and Holocaust survivor [ORGANIZATION] said she will defy medical advice and will be in [LOCATION] to vote for the government, describing the crisis as incomprehensible.181 PERSON84 Appeals for Rejection of Evil Attacking GPE60182 Ruling ORG90 ORG91 leader [PERSON], while speaking at a church in GPE59 in southern GPE60, warned those gathered that an evil is attacking GPE60 and the [ORGANIZATION]00.

PERSON88 writes that in a [ORGANIZATION] characterized by the waning power of PERSON89 and consequently that of GPE61 that PERSON86 has, in [ORGANIZATION]4, found himself an ally who is far more influential than people give him credit for. PERSON86 and [ORGANIZATION]4 arent political twins. But PERSON86, perhaps sensing which [STREET] the wind is blowing, has come a long [STREET] since DATE28, when he was saluted as the antidote to the nationalism of PERSON90 and Donald [ORGANIZATION], PERSON88 writes. Just as [ORGANIZATION]4 and his [ORGANIZATION]03 party turned their backs on their founding liberalism and identity of youthful revolt, there isnt much liberalism left in PERSON86.185 Over 50,000 Restaurants in GPE52 Declare PERSON64 Open Defying Lockdown Measures186 Via [URL], DATE53, over 50,000 restaurants in GPE52 began defying the countrys strict anti-[PERSON] lockdown measures in a massive act of civil disobedience according to [ORGANIZATION]04.

Acting on the authority of the Polish president, I will meet British Ambassador [ORGANIZATION]06 to discuss the case of the Pole in a coma in a GPE71 hospital, tweeted [ORGANIZATION]04 on [ORGANIZATION]5. The middle-aged Polish man who has lived in [LOCATION] for over ten [LOCATION]s was admitted to hospital in DATE72 having suffered cardiac arrest for [TIME], during which, according to the hospitals authorities, the individual suffered permanent brain damage.

According to Israeli news site [ORGANIZATION]29, doctors estimate that the number of similar cases could be higher and are questioning if they should administer the second dose of the vaccine to those who suffered facial paralysis. However, [ORGANIZATION] recommends they should go ahead, but only if the paralysis passes, the report says.213 LOC8 Hit by Icy Blast as Snow Blankets Parts of GPE72 The LOC9 desert has been hit by an icy blast with temperatures dipping below freezing.

Relatives left the village on [ORGANIZATION]1 29, while [ORGANIZATION]11 stayed behind. Azeri forces later captured the village and following the ceasefire agreement she was reported missing. When [ORGANIZATION]11s body was discovered, it had been mutilated nearly beyond recognition. Her brother [ORGANIZATION]13 only recognized her by her clothing. Relatives also reported that [ORGANIZATION]14s feet, hands and ears had been cut off as part of her torture. These types of atrocities are reminiscent of those committed during previous pogroms and genocides against the Armenian Christian community. [ORGANIZATION]14 is one of many Armenians who were killed needlessly at the hands of Azeri forces in the GPE77 region. Azerbaijans dehumanization of Armenian Christians is also influenced by [PERSON]0. It is a combination which builds concern for the remaining Armenian Christian community in GPE77.219 [PERSON]2 Wants to Prosecute Online Blasphemy Committed Abroad220 [PERSON]2 is threatening to prosecute non-[PERSON]2is in foreign countries for breaking its blasphemy laws online. The country, which is no stranger to censorship, seems to be copying [PERSON]3, which also tries to prosecute foreigners found guilty of criticizing the Chinese communist party. The decision seems to be focused on [LOCATION], an [ORGANIZATION]6ic sect whose beliefs are considered blasphemous in [PERSON]2.

Christians are being slaughtered all across [LOCATION]0, they are being taken to concentration camps in [PERSON]5, thousands of churches have been brutally shut down under a new wave of persecution in [PERSON]3, and millions of believers throughout [LOCATION]1 must live knowing that each new day may be their last. Of course most [ORGANIZATION] have never heard about any of this because the mainstream media wont cover it. Thankfully, there are organizations that do keep track of what is happening to Christians around the globe, and one of them is [ORGANIZATION]34[PERSON]A. According to the group, the number of Christians that were killed for their faith was 60 percent higher in [LOCATION]6 than it was in DATE83 The watchdog organization [ORGANIZATION]34[PERSON]A says levels of Christian persecution are at a record high around the world. [ORGANIZATION]34 reports that levels of Christian persecution are at a record high, revealing that the number of Christians murdered for their faith rose 60 percent in [LOCATION]6. A 6 percent rise in a single [LOCATION] would be bad. A 60 percent increase is a nightmare.225 [ORGANIZATION] Which [DATE] Explain How Animals See Magnetic Fields for [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION]35 claim to have observed a reaction showing quantum physics directly impacting biochemistry, which they suspect explains how certain animals can perceive the Earths magnetic field. Researchers have long suspected that some part of various animals visual systems, including migratory birds, allows them to perceive the Earths magnetic fields, affording them the ability to navigate vast distances during migratory periods, but have never been able to find the mechanism. Until now, that is. The [ORGANIZATION]36 team used a custom microscope, which can detect extremely faint flashes of light, on a culture of human cells which contained an extremely light-sensitive material that can respond to changes in a magnetic field. Photoreceptors, called cryptochromes, are found in the cells of numerous species, including migratory birds and dogs and, curiously, humans.227 The [PERSON]4 Migrants Fleeing to the [PERSON]228 The [PERSON] will introduce a new visa at the end of DATE2 that will give 5.4 million [PERSON]4 residents a staggering 70 of the territorys population the right to come and live in the [PERSON], and eventually become citizens. It is making this generous offer to residents of its former colony because it believes [PERSON]3 is undermining [PERSON]4s rights and freedoms. Not everyone will come. Some of those eligible to leave have expressed their determination to stay and continue the fight for democracy. In the end, GPE65 estimates that about 300,000 will take up the visa offer over [DATE] [LOCATION]s.229 [PERSON] Scientist Who Led Charge Against [PERSON] Lab Leak Theory Admits He Was Trying to Protect Chinese Scientists230 The GPE7 scientist behind an effort to stymie debate surrounding the possibility that [ORGANIZATION] could have accidentally escaped from [ORGANIZATION]37 admitted through a spokesman that he did so to protect Chinese scientists from online criticism.

A [ORGANIZATION]41 report from [LOCATION]3 revealed that the total number of attempted illegal crossings by boat including successful, intercepted, and where evidence of illegal crossing was found was 15,000 for the whole of [LOCATION]6.243 German Police Detain 23 Illegal Migrants, Hand Them Over to GPE91 German police discovered 23 migrants in three vans they stopped near the town of [PERSON] near the border with [LOCATION]. Twenty men and three women were crammed into a very small space, the [ORGANIZATION]42 news agency reported. All migrants and three smugglers were handed over to [LOCATION]. Police checked the vans on [ORGANIZATION] on the FAC13 motorway between the towns of [PERSON] and [PERSON], which lie five and ten kilometers, respectively, from the Czech town of GPE95.

In many cases, an [PERSON] review of discrimination complaints found, there was no evidence that city officials had decided whether a landlord had discriminated when those decisions did come, they were painfully slow, rarely meeting the deadlines outlined in the law. Federal and state fair housing laws prohibit discrimination based on race, gender, and other categories, but the protection based on someones source of income exists only at the local level. That means victims of this kind of discrimination cant file complaints with state or federal agencies, only with the city.

buffalo,2019-05-01T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WGRZ,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] lags on addressing lead poisoning,"The county has enacted the three recommendations it was asked to adopt. The state has implemented at least one of its five. However, Mayor [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] have not enacted any of the eleven recommendations requiring city action. While the administration has done some of the necessary legwork, it has not yet translated it into proposed legislation or much in the [STREET] of policy. The [ORGANIZATION] has initiated nothing on its own. Everybody needs to be tested, every house needs to be tested, and remediated, and that has to happen, as soon as humanly possible, said [PERSON], co-director of organizing at ORG2, which is active on [ORGANIZATION] promoting affordable housing and social justice. Why the delay on the citys part? [ORGANIZATION] refused to answer questions for this story. PERSON3, assistant director at the citys department of Permit ...spection Services, told ORG3 that work has been going on behind the scenes. We are hoping to roll out a variety of different initiatives in the very near future, he said.The problemLead, even in small traces, can have devastating effects on developing brains. In children, it can lead to learning difficulties, behavioral issues and health problems like high blood pressure and anemia. In [ORGANIZATION], about 700 children across the county were diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels, according to the state and county health departments. The vast majority live in [LOCATION] low-income neighborhoods. Children who live in predominantly black and [ORGANIZATION] neighborhoods are 12 times more likely than children in mostly white neighborhoods to have an elevated blood lead level, according to a study cited in the action plan. ORG3 reported in [LOCATION] that one zip code on [LOCATION] West Side and two on its LOC3 accounted for three of the four zip codes with the most new cases of lead poisoning in all of upstate. [PERSON], in a [ORGANIZATION] national [PERSON], declared [ORGANIZATION] among the most dangerous lead hotspots in [PERSON]. Lead poisoning rates in [LOCATION] hardest-hit neighborhoods were eight times higher than those in GPE2, [PERSON], during that citys water crisis, the news service reported. The main source of the problem in [ORGANIZATION] is lead paint in the citys old housing stock. The action plan determined that children living in one and two family rental units are most at risk. With this in mind, the plan emphasized the need for legislation that would mandate all one and two family rentals be inspected for lead hazards on a regular basis. Other recommendations in the report include requiring contractors to provide ground cover when doing demolitions city, strengthening enforcement of lead safe work practice rules county, and lowering the level of lead within a childs blood that would trigger an intervention state. The report was released in DATE2 by the Community Foundation for Greater [ORGANIZATION], which worked with a variety of partners, including the city and county.County and state [PERSON] has adopted the three measures the action plan asked of it. We jumped right on the recommendations, and we are behind it, we want to do it, because we are all on the same page to eradicate lead poisoning, said [ORGANIZATION], a senior public health sanitarian with the county ORG6. Contractors and property owners have been required to follow lead safe work practices intended to avoid the spread of dust when disturbing lead paint. A change in the countys sanitary code provides inspectors with new enforcement powers. Previously, the primary agency responsible for enforcing lead safe work practices was ORG7. But ORG8 program has been extremely limited. In [LOCATION], it [PERSON] with 123 contractors, landlords and property managers nationwide. Of these cases, only three were in [PERSON] and none were upstate. The county also stepped up enforcement action against landlords who knowingly rent housing with lead hazards. Violators are now referred to the [ORGANIZATION] District Attorneys office for possible criminal prosecution. Thats happened once already, when PERSON5, a landlord from GPE7, was charged in March.8 I got to give the county a lot of credit for seeing that landlord arrested [PERSON], that should be shouted from the highest mountain top, [PERSON], the environmental hazard trainer, said in DATE5.Our DATE6 Newsletter [PERSON] Frame9 The reports final recommendation to the county  to inspect the home of any family with a child [PERSON] who receive a security deposit from the county ORG9  has generated only seven referrals, said [ORGANIZATION]. The action plan also included five recommendations for state action. [PERSON] has adopted one, lowering the threshold for lead levels in a childs blood that trigger intervention. Recommendations not acted on include a state takeover of the [ORGANIZATION]0 enforcement program for violations of lead safe work practices, as 14 other states have done.City inactionIn a press release10 DATE8, [ORGANIZATION] said his administration would review the action plans recommendations and take the additional and necessary steps to protect children. As of DATE9, none of the recommendations have been implemented, though the city is currently undertaking the legwork to enact several recommendations [LOCATION]0. The key recommendation would mandate periodic interior inspections of one and two unit rentals for lead hazards. Related is a recommendation that owner-occupied doubles be required to register as rental properties and that the rental unit be subject to inspection. These changes would require Common [ORGANIZATION] approval. GPE8 mandated11 interior inspections in [LOCATION]1. Since then, the number of children diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels has dropped substantially. Why hasnt [ORGANIZATION] gotten more done? In terms of the implementation, its a long process. The process is not just writing something down, said PERSON8, citing the need to draft legislation, hire staffers and find funding. GPE9, the ORG2 organizer, said change is not happening fast enough. We are on a moving train and it is moving a lot faster than we have the resources to stop it with, he said.More information on lead poisoning An application for the county ORG6s lead remediation program is available on its website12 or at [PHONE]. Training in lead safe work practices, provided by the ORG6s free to homeowners, is also available online13 or by calling [PHONE].

While black and Hispanic students account for 67 percent of [INSTITUTION] students, they only made up 10 percent of the offers at these specialized high schools in [DATE].

PERSON20 PERSON21 was also accused of stereotyping against Asian-GPE2ns who attend, or strive to attend, these specialized high schools. PERSON20 PERSON21 is a little biased, PERSON23 said, speaking to [ORGANIZATION]7 on [PERSON]. It showed implicit bias when he said all Asians are economically sound, well, we can afford tutoring. That sounds like a racist statement to me that reinforces a negative stereotype.54 [ORGANIZATION] Mother Charged in Terrorism Plot to Use [ORGANIZATION]8 to Promote [ORGANIZATION]9, [PERSON] A [ORGANIZATION] woman hacked social media accounts, including [ORGANIZATION]8, to recruit on behalf of the ORG21 terrorist group and to provide instruction on such terrorism basics as making explosives and biological weapons including ricin, according to a federal criminal complaint.

Think about the logic of this You want to help the homeless, so you put a tax on the thing that would help homeless people the most  a job.

The problem with the internet is anonymity, according to them. Wouldnt we all be better off if we were forced to identify ourselves before using social media platforms?

After wading through the many paragraphs on what is expect[PERSON] to happen not much with the [ORGANIZATION] shindig on [PERSON]4 in GPE10, we come to the important section about [PERSON] special propaganda show on [PERSON]. We expect him to use the gathering to lecture and guilt-trip [PERSON]s into welcoming even more of the third world to live in your neighborhoods.

From [ORGANIZATION]3 hat tip [PERSON]2 With hopes already dash[PERSON] that anything substantial will come out of the [ORGANIZATION]0 summit, some are looking to [ORGANIZATION] that President Barack [PERSON] will convene on the margins of [ORGANIZATION]4 the following [PERSON] to deliver more tangible outcomes. But while there are relatively few unknowns associat[PERSON] with the [ORGANIZATION]0 summit, the leaders gathering on Tues[PERSON], 20 [ORGANIZATION]7 is one big unknown. The stat[PERSON] aims of the leaders summit are to double the number of refugees who are resettl[PERSON] or admitt[PERSON] through other legal channels to third countries to increase funding for humanitarian responses by 30 percent and to increase the number of refugees in school and who are grant[PERSON] the legal right to work by one million each More40 Breaking [ORGANIZATION] announces plan to bring in 110,000 refugees [PERSON]8 [PERSON]3 Conservative Review [PERSON]3 Earlier to[PERSON], pursuant to the Refugee Act of [ORGANIZATION]5, which requires the [ORGANIZATION] to consult with [ORGANIZATION] on the [PERSON]9 level of refugee intake, the [PERSON] administration announc[PERSON] its plans to admit 110,000 refugees in [ORGANIZATION]0 beginning [ORGANIZATION]1. That is a 25,000 net increase from this current [ORGANIZATION]2 level, and a 40,000 net increase from [ORGANIZATION]3. It is also 10,000 more than the [ORGANIZATION] project[PERSON] for [ORGANIZATION]0 during [ORGANIZATION]4 consultation with [ORGANIZATION]. Are the people and their representatives powerless in stopping this forc[PERSON] transformation? As I wrote in [PERSON], [PERSON]4 promis[PERSON] that the [ORGANIZATION]5 refugee bill would limit the flow of refugees and increase [ORGANIZATION]ional input in the process. Refugee intake was to be capp[PERSON] at 50,000 a year. But in a sleight of hand that the public would have never approv[PERSON] had it been advertis[PERSON] in a transparent [STREET], the president was grant[PERSON] de facto unilateral authority to increase the flow over and beyond the 50,000 cap beginning in [DATE] in consultation with [ORGANIZATION]. Initially, [ORGANIZATION] took the [PERSON]9 consultations, usually occurring in [ORGANIZATION]7 prior to the next [ORGANIZATION]2s, quite seriously. They conduct[PERSON] hearings and spell[PERSON] out the refugee ne[PERSON]s and concerns. Now it has become nothing more than [ORGANIZATION] officials briefing the [ORGANIZATION]6 and [ORGANIZATION] on how many refugees they will take in with no recourse from [ORGANIZATION] to say no. Thus, we are stuck with this massive social transformation and security risk, and no ability to stop it statutorily. Just to[PERSON], GPE13 arrest[PERSON] three [ORGANIZATION]n refugees43 on suspicion that they have ties to the Islamic ORG3. That [PERSON] could unilaterally force a similar policy down the throats of [PERSON] citizens and [ORGANIZATION] sits back impotently without learning the lessons of [ORGANIZATION] is horrific. With [ORGANIZATION]0 remaining to the current [ORGANIZATION]2, we have already admitt[PERSON] 11,503 [ORGANIZATION] refugees. According to the [ORGANIZATION] refugee [PERSON], as of [ORGANIZATION]7 13, roughly 99.3 percent of the [ORGANIZATION]n refugees are Muslim, despite the Christians taking the brunt of the ethnic persecution, which is the main determinant of refugee status bas[PERSON] on statute. 8,436 refugees were brought in from GPE15, [ORGANIZATION]3 of refugee intake from that country - a country of origin that has proven to pose one of the greatest security risks in terms of homegrown terror45. All but two were Muslim. Overall, roughly half the 77,000 refugees admitt[PERSON] so far [ORGANIZATION]4 are Muslim and from volatile places such as GPE[DATE], [LOCATION], [PERSON], GPE18, GPE15, [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION]. Also disturbing is the fact that [PERSON] is se[PERSON]ing small communities with large numbers of refugees who are radically different from the local population, and he refusing to cooperate with state and local officials. The administration has declin[PERSON] to inform governors47 of refugee resettlement, even after refugees were resettl[PERSON] in their respective jurisdictions, despite the legal requirement of advanc[PERSON] consultation with states. And while courts grant illegal immigrants standing to sue for citizen rights, they block states from suing [PERSON] for violating the refugee statutes48 More49 Where are legally requir[PERSON] hearings in [ORGANIZATION]6 and [ORGANIZATION]7 on [PERSON] refugee plan for [LOCATION]DATE89?50 [PERSON]1 Refugee Resettlement Watch [ORGANIZATION]7 8, [PERSON]2 President Barack Hussein [PERSON] will send his final determination letter to [ORGANIZATION]9 [ORGANIZATION]6 with the number of refugees 200,000?[DATE] he wants admitt[PERSON] to the country in [ORGANIZATION]7 which begins in 23 [PERSON]s! Im guessing the letter and the requir[PERSON] report wont be deliver[PERSON] until his big show at the [ORGANIZATION]0 on [ORGANIZATION]7 20th. That gives little time for [ORGANIZATION] to do the job legally requir[PERSON] of it under the Refugee Act of [ORGANIZATION]5 and that is to hold hearings in both the [ORGANIZATION]652 and [ORGANIZATION]s53. However since both committees know what is requir[PERSON] of them, they could have the hearings on their respective committee calendars for [DATE] imm[PERSON]iately following [PERSON]. I am not seeing anything on either of their calendars. I wont stop beating this drum! The number of refugees admitt[PERSON] to the GPE20 [PERSON]1 will depend on the REPUBLICANS IN ORG21 not on [PERSON]!. They can cut the funding for the program and thus cut the number of refugees plac[PERSON] in your towns! If they want to! [PERSON]2 was [PERSON]3 in [PERSON]4 where [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]s held any legally requir[PERSON] hearing on the Presidents plan and that is only because so many of you were clamoring for hearings in light of the huge [ORGANIZATION]n numbers being propos[PERSON] you know the number will be even bigger [PERSON]5, [PERSON]6 wants 65,000!. But, both hearings came after the [ORGANIZATION]2 had begun. See here here54 too little too late. Because they want to get home and campaign [PERSON]7, they will have adjourn[PERSON] and there will be no hearings in [PERSON]8, therefore we must demand a hearing in both committees [ORGANIZATION]6!

The [PERSON] administration told [ORGANIZATION] it wants to permanently resettle 110,000 refugees in [PERSON]0 which begins [PERSON]1, roughly half of them coming from [ORGANIZATION], GPE15, GPE[DATE], GPE18, [LOCATION] and other jihadist hotspots where vetting of refugees is extremely difficult. Thats a frightening number for many conservatives in [ORGANIZATION] - up 29 percent from [PERSON]2 levels of 85,000 refugees, and up 57 percent from [PERSON]3 when 70,000 refugees were deliver[PERSON] to GPE21 cities and towns. But the actual numbers will likely end up being much higher than even the president is admitting, possibly as high as 150,000 to 200,000, experts say. Thats because, as ORG26 earlier report[PERSON], the [PERSON] administration has consult[PERSON] with [ORGANIZATION] ORG9s High Commissioner for Refugees [PERSON]8 on ways to bring more refugees from [ORGANIZATION] into [LOCATION] under alternative pathways. This stream of refugees would not be call[PERSON] refugees at all, but rather they would enter the GPE21 on student visas, health visas, expansion of the family-reunification visa and other creative methods. Under the Refugee Act of [ORGANIZATION]5, a law author[PERSON] by the late [PERSON]4, most of the authority over the program was given to the executive branch. [ORGANIZATION] controls funding for the program, but everything else - how many refugees come from what countries and where they get sent upon arrival in the GPE21 - is controll[PERSON] by the president. [ORGANIZATION], regardless of what party is in control, has in [PERSON]4 never deni[PERSON] funding for a presidents refugee program, meaning it is very unlikely it will do so [PERSON]5. Finally, the people get a choice But [PERSON]5, the [PERSON] people actually have a choice, by electing [PERSON]9 to the White [ORGANIZATION]6, says conservative writer [PERSON]3, author of [PERSON]. PERSON20 has said he will stop all refugee resettlement from terrorist-harboring countries. His opponent, [PERSON]6 Clinton, has said she intends to increase the resettlements from [ORGANIZATION] by 550 percent [PERSON], GPE23 City Leaders Not Inform[PERSON] by [PERSON] of Plan to Send 100 [ORGANIZATION]n, [ORGANIZATION] Refugees60 It is crystal clear that [PERSON] and his gang are trying to distract us from the Islamist threat with shiny objects like global warming and [ORGANIZATION] our nation by stealth while we are looking in another direction PERSON22 [ORGANIZATION] 15 Sep [PERSON]2 [ORGANIZATION] has learn[PERSON] that a resettlement agency fund[PERSON] by the [PERSON] administration plans to send 100 [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]n refugees to [LOCATION], GPE23, in the [ORGANIZATION]2 that begins [PERSON]6 on [ORGANIZATION]1. But that plan appears to violate a clause in the f[PERSON]eral Refugee Act of [ORGANIZATION]561 which requires the f[PERSON]eral government and director of [LOCATION] to consult with local as well as state governments prior to the placement of any refugees within their boundaries. At this point it appears city leaders have not been inform[PERSON] of the details regarding this matter, a spokesperson for Mayor PERSON23 and the city of [LOCATION] tells [ORGANIZATION]. Its the same story with the government of GPE24, in which [LOCATION] is locat[PERSON]. As of this time [ORGANIZATION] has not been notifi[PERSON] of any settlement of 100 refugees from [LOCATION], PERSON24, Chairman of [ORGANIZATION], tells [ORGANIZATION] through a spokesperson. [LOCATION], a city of 100,000, is in the midst of a financial and public health crisis due to high levels of lead in its drinking water62 after a [PERSON]7 change in its source from ORG31 to the [LOCATION] River63. According to this [ORGANIZATION]0 [PERSON] submitt[PERSON] to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], which operates in GPE23 as ORG34, the resettlement agency plans to bring 100 [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]n refugees to [LOCATION] GPE23 in the [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]2 that begins in [PERSON]9. The document was obtain[PERSON] in a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] request from [ORGANIZATION]. With all the financial and public health problems the city of [LOCATION], GPE23 faces, critics are wondering if it makes any sense to force 100 [ORGANIZATION]n and [ORGANIZATION] refugees upon the citizens of [LOCATION], GPE23. The [PERSON] administration told [ORGANIZATION] on Tues[PERSON] it wants to increase the number of refugees65 brought into the GPE21 in [ORGANIZATION]0 to 110,000 up 29 from 85,000 in [LOCATION] [PERSON]2. Unless [ORGANIZATION] specifically rejects [PERSON] plan, that 110,000 number will go into effect starting [ORGANIZATION]1. Resettlement agency abstracts across the country are almost always rubber-stamp[PERSON] by the [PERSON] administration. That is likely to be the case in GPE23 in [ORGANIZATION]0, as ORG36 report[PERSON] recently66 [ORGANIZATION] Increase [PERSON] in GPE23 by 40 Percent, Send 100 to [LOCATION]68 Also, notice how these resettlement agencies are renaming themselves in order to dissociate from their Christian and Jewish origins It is just another sign that they have sold out and have become mere extensions of [PERSON] immigration policies PERSON22 [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] Sep [PERSON]2 [ORGANIZATION] has obtain[PERSON] the [ORGANIZATION]0 refugee resettlement proposals from the five leading resettlement agencies that operate in GPE23 showing they plan to jam down a 40 percent increase in refugees from the LOC3 region, which includes [ORGANIZATION], on residents of GPE23 in the [ORGANIZATION]2 that begins on [ORGANIZATION]1. These plans in GPE23 are completely consistent with the nationwide refugee number determination the [PERSON] Administration present[PERSON] to [ORGANIZATION]69 on Tues[PERSON] an increase of the [ORGANIZATION]0 ceiling by 29 percent to 110,000, up from the ceiling of 85,000 that was approv[PERSON] for [LOCATION] [PERSON]2. The actual final number for [LOCATION] [PERSON]2 is likely to reach or exce[PERSON] the original ceiling number, if the run rate of DATE63 continues for the final [ORGANIZATION]0 of the [ORGANIZATION]2. In their [LOCATION] [PERSON]2 plans, these five agencies-ORG39 which recently chang[PERSON] the name of its GPE23 operation to [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION]1, [LOCATION]2, [LOCATION]3 formerly [LOCATION]4, and [LOCATION]5 propos[PERSON] 4,060 refugees overall to be resettl[PERSON] in GPE23, 2,567 from the LOC3 region, which includes [ORGANIZATION]. As of [ORGANIZATION]7 13, 3,783 75total refugees, 1,[ZIP] of whom are from [ORGANIZATION], have been resettl[PERSON] in GPE23 to date this [ORGANIZATION]2. At the accelerat[PERSON] run rate of [PERSON], DATE67 numbers are likely to hit or exce[PERSON] the [LOCATION] [PERSON]2 plan for 4,000 total refugees in GPE23, of which over 1,300 are [ORGANIZATION]n refugees. The [ORGANIZATION]0 plans, obtain[PERSON] through [ORGANIZATION] request made to [ORGANIZATION] by a local GPE23 grassroots group as were the [LOCATION] [PERSON]2 plans, show that that these five resettlement agencies have propos[PERSON] a 38 percent increase in overall refugee resettlement, up to 5,606 refugees. This includes a 40 percent increase in refugees from the LOC3 region that includes [ORGANIZATION], to 3,586 More77 [PERSON] Administration to GPE25, GPE23 No, We Wont [ORGANIZATION] with Refugee Law78 PERSON25 [ORGANIZATION] 8 Sep [PERSON]2 PERSON26, the [PERSON] administrations director of [ORGANIZATION], recently told GPE25, GPE23 that the agency he directs has no intention of complying with the Refugee Act of [ORGANIZATION]579s requirement that it consult regularly with local governments concerning the sponsorship process and the intend[PERSON] distribution among the ORG3s and localities before their placement in those ORG3s and localities. In a letter to PERSON27 dat[PERSON] DATE69, GPE25 [LOCATION] PERSON28 wrote It has come to my attention that between [ORGANIZATION]1, [PERSON]3 and [DATE], [PERSON]2, 1,860 refugees have been plac[PERSON] in the ORG3 of GPE23Of those 1,860 refugees estimates are that hundr[PERSON]s of them have been resettl[PERSON] in GPE25. GPE25 has not been consult[PERSON] with respect to the placement of refugees in our jurisdiction. Exact numbers of refugees plac[PERSON] in GPE25 are not readily available as the f[PERSON]eral government is not performing its statutory duty to consult with local governments as discuss[PERSON] below. PERSON29 then request[PERSON] and demand[PERSON] that [LOCATION] . . . 1. provide GPE25 with all pertinent information regarding all refugees settl[PERSON] in GPE25 in DATE72 and . . . 2. begin consulting with us DATE73 as requir[PERSON] by f[PERSON]eral law concerning refugees to be resettl[PERSON] in the county in the future. PERSON27s response to PERSON29s demand was condescending and dismissive Concerning your request about consultation, GPE23 submitt[PERSON] a ORG3 Plan for [ORGANIZATION]2 [PERSON]2 describing resettlement activities in the state. In the ORG3 Plan, GPE23 stat[PERSON] that consultation meetings would be conven[PERSON] on at least a DATE73 basis with representatives of local affiliates of resettlement agencies, state and local government agencies, and other community-bas[PERSON] organizations that serve refugees. These meetings are held in each of the three resettlement regions in GPE23. Additionally, [ORGANIZATION] facilitates coordination among resettlement partners across the state. I encourage you to work with state officials to ensure you are includ[PERSON] in these consultation meetings in the future. [TIME], in turn, works through the [ORGANIZATION] and its regional representatives to maintain open communications with the state. PERSON27 places the burden for finding out about these consultation meetings and attending them on GPE25. The Refugee Act of [ORGANIZATION]5, however, requires both the director of [TIME] and the f[PERSON]eral agency administering the program, which could mean an employee of [TIME], to consult with the locality prior to the placement of refugees there. The statute does not include any provision to accomplish this consultation through the [ORGANIZATION], who actually is an employee of the state government, not a representative of the f[PERSON]eral bureaucracy. PERSON27 also dismiss[PERSON] GPE25s demand to obtain all pertinent information regarding all refugees settl[PERSON] in GPE25 in DATE72 You request[PERSON] pertinent information regarding all refugees settl[PERSON] in GPE25 in DATE72 and [TIME] does not share personally identifiable information about refugees. Therefore, we cannot fulfill your request. The Refugee Act of [ORGANIZATION]5, however, specifically requires that all public health problems associat[PERSON] with specific refugees be report[PERSON] to county officials. As ORG36 report[PERSON]80 Refugee resettlement agencies are requir[PERSON] by the Refugee Act of [ORGANIZATION]5 to assure that refugees, known to the agency as having been identifi[PERSON] . . . as having m[PERSON]ical conditions affecting the public health and requiring treatment such as active and latent [ORGANIZATION], report to the appropriate county or other health agency, and that their health status is subsequently monitor[PERSON] by both the county or other health agencies More81 Forget asking nicely, time to use fre[PERSON]om of information laws GPE23 model82 [PERSON]1 Refugee Resettlement Watch [PERSON] We learn[PERSON] DATE75 that the [PERSON] Administration is setting the table for a huge increase in the number of refugees to be admitt[PERSON] to the GPE20 for the new [ORGANIZATION]2 which begins [ORGANIZATION]1, presumably setting things up for a [PERSON]6 presidency and making it harder for a PERSON20 administration to pull those numbers back in DATE76 without hate-fill[PERSON] attacks against him whenif he does. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth waahhh! with refugee contractors saying they are already in the pipeline. We also know that the REPUBLICAN [ORGANIZATION] has the final word because they can appropriate money for the program or withhold the funding in [ORGANIZATION] and DATE78. However, now that the Presidential determination has been sent to [ORGANIZATION]83 there is no reason a local refugee office or a state refugee coordinator should withhold from you the Reception and Placement Abstract84 which lays out how many the local resettlement contractor is planning for your town. I know many of you have been asking nicely for those important planning documents and are being rebuff[PERSON]. They like to use the excuse that they were in the deliberative stage with their plans for your communities, but that excuse is now gone! All of those documents were us[PERSON] to prepare the determination that has been deliver[PERSON] to the [ORGANIZATION]6 and [ORGANIZATION]s.

[ORGANIZATION]1[DATE] More117 More refugees resettl[PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION] area than anywhere else in [PERSON]9 Two key points PERSON59 Once the resettlement process starts, it accelerates becauseexisting refugees can bring in relatives using an exp[PERSON]it[PERSON] process The big businesses that convince politicians to bring in refugeescan have economic downturnsas happen[PERSON] to [PERSON]0 fracking industrywhen [PERSON]1 flood[PERSON] the oil market and drove prices downThese businesses have not only swapp[PERSON] out [PERSON] workersfor low-wage refugeesthey have abandon[PERSON] they brought in and spik[PERSON] the local unemployment rateswith refugees who now have little hope of finding a job. [PERSON]0 [PERSON]2 [PERSON] 8, [PERSON]2 [PERSON]3 By a wide margin, the [ORGANIZATION] area takes in more refugees than any other [STREET] in [PERSON]4. [ORGANIZATION], West [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, have receiv[PERSON] a total of 6,220 refugees since DATE96 over three times the number who arriv[PERSON] in [PERSON]2 and [PERSON]8 combin[PERSON], according to ORG39 of [PERSON]4 [ORGANIZATION], the nonprofit group hir[PERSON] by the f[PERSON]eral government to resettle refugees in [PERSON]4 and [PERSON]6. [PERSON]9 Commissioner [PERSON]1 brought up this discrepancy at a meeting of refugee resettlement officials on [ORGANIZATION], [DATE]. He told the group h[PERSON] like to see refugees spread more proportionately across the state, given that [PERSON]9s social service system doesnt have enough money to meet their ne[PERSON]s. Right now, our social services is overburden[PERSON] to the nth degree, he said. There is a substantive burden spent when we have folks in this quantity coming in that make the lower salaries. [PERSON]9 represents 23 percent of [PERSON]0 population. But the county has taken in 72 percent of the states refugees in [ORGANIZATION]2 [PERSON]2, which ends [ORGANIZATION]6, according to [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]2, who oversees refugee resettlement for [ORGANIZATION], said one reason so many refugees land in the [ORGANIZATION] area is the availability of housing and support services, as well as job and [PERSON]ucation opportunities. Another factor is that the [ORGANIZATION] area has the states biggest ethnic community, and a large amount of [ORGANIZATION] resettlement work involves reuniting incoming refugees with relatives already living here. Family ties help remove or r[PERSON]uce isolation, and support the families, [PERSON]3 said, noting that refugees without ties are mostly being sent to [PERSON]8. [ORGANIZATION]1 Commissioner [PERSON]4, who also attend[PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]s meeting, said she embraces having refugees in the community, but she believes resettlement ne[PERSON]s to be done in a fiscally sound [STREET] We want to make sure that we have the resources to support people when they come here as well, and maybe other communities could share that responsibility with us It shouldnt be a burden to [PERSON]9 taxpayers only. [PERSON]5 said he expects oil extraction in western [PERSON]4 to eventually ramp up again, at which point communities there could benefit from refugee workers More119 GPE2 building refugee camps, segregating the sexes120 [PERSON]1 Refugee Resettlement Watch [ORGANIZATION]7 7, [PERSON]2 Invasion of [ORGANIZATION] news Refugee camp to open in GPE2 in [PERSON]8. It isnt quite this bad here. We dont have camps yet, but.. could it happen? Already housing is short for the tens of thousands of refugees [PERSON] and the Republican [ORGANIZATION] have admitt[PERSON] this [ORGANIZATION]2. We still have over 10,000 to squeeze in to GPE12 [ORGANIZATION]6 see here121! And, we have tens of thousands of so-call[PERSON] unaccompani[PERSON] alien children to house. Could we end up with refugee camps in GPE12? Thanks to [PERSON]2 for this story from [ORGANIZATION]2 at ORG77. You will have to read it yourself because it wont allow any snips. The gist of the story is that so many asylum seekers are building make-shift camps that the powers-that-be have decid[PERSON] to build them some nice ones right in GPE2. They are segregating the refugees by sex because of all the rape and other sexual abuse going on in refugee housing throughout [ORGANIZATION] More123 [PERSON], [PERSON] running out of housing for refugees bring in prefabs?124 [PERSON]1 Refugee Resettlement Watch [ORGANIZATION]7 8, [PERSON]2 So what else is new. We told you here just the other [PERSON]125 that [PERSON]5, [ORGANIZATION], which is getting its first refugees, cant even find housing for the first arrivals. [PERSON] resettlement contractors are plowing ahead nevertheless trying to hit the 85,000 mark for this [ORGANIZATION]2 see here126. I wonder does the GPE20 [ORGANIZATION] give them a pass on their contracts which require providing a properly-siz[PERSON] house or apartment so they can get those bodies in here before the bell tolls [TIME] on [PERSON]01? And, what makes them think they will have housing for 200,000 [PERSON]02 when they cant find it for 85,000 [PERSON]5? If your town is gleefully building low income housing, be ready for refugees! [PERSON] has been a long-establish[PERSON] refugee site but gee, not enough affordable housing so now some are suggesting bringing in prefabricat[PERSON] housing can you say refugee camp127? From ORG79 [PERSON]128 [ORGANIZATION]4, [ORGANIZATION]5 ORG79- The number of refugees coming to [PERSON] continues to grow.

[ORGANIZATION]09[PERSON] to my report131 Satur[PERSON] headlin[PERSON], The big lie refugees are not being vett[PERSON], this is what domstudent11 reports [PERSON]6, they are inde[PERSON] not being vett[PERSON]! As a shocking update to the refugee family in my family members apartment [ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]8, it turns out that these people [ORGANIZATION]D to [ORGANIZATION]0 and the church that sponsor[PERSON] them.

The [ORGANIZATION]7 Police are now involv[PERSON]. This family has gone underground. So much for vetting. Even the contractors are fool[PERSON]! What are the two important points to take away? First, refugees are not being thoroughly vett[PERSON] some not vett[PERSON] at all, and that landlords are increasingly wary of leasing to refugees especially as we learn[PERSON] here132, the resettlement contractors dropping them in your towns will not back up the refugees by co-signing their leases amazing!. BTW, if the lazy, fearful complicit Members of [ORGANIZATION] really want[PERSON] to reform this program they could make some simple fixes initially and one would be to make it a law that f[PERSON]eral resettlement contractors must co-sign every home or apartment lease when they [STREET] refugees. And, make sure damages come from their own meager, privately rais[PERSON] funds not from more of your tax dollars More133 [ORGANIZATION], GPE7 to hold two welcoming public conversations [ORGANIZATION]6134 [PERSON]1 Refugee Resettlement Watch [ORGANIZATION]7 7, [PERSON]2 We told you the other [PERSON] that [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]9 was ready and eager to welcome [ORGANIZATION]n Muslims 99 of [ORGANIZATION]ns being admitt[PERSON] to the GPE20 are Muslims this coming [ORGANIZATION]2 which begins in [PERSON]09, on [ORGANIZATION]1. [ORGANIZATION]2, the primary resettlement agency there is holding two meetings [ORGANIZATION]6 to find support and help for the refugees because they do admit that after 90 [PERSON]s [ORGANIZATION]2 taxpayer-fund[PERSON] help ends. At that time the refugees become dependent on the goodwill of the city and the welfare that [ORGANIZATION]2 has sign[PERSON] them up for. Here is the news at [URL]135. Our earlier post on the new refugee program for [ORGANIZATION] is here136. How is the housing in this upscale city? A shortage of housing seems to be a growing problem everywhere. GPE70 residents are invit[PERSON] to attend two public conversations on the upcoming resettlement of [DATE] refugees into the city.

The second will take [STREET] [PERSON]12 from [TIME] at the GPE70 Senior Center.

This is the next installment in my recent civics lesson Im learning this too! in what I hope is not a vain time wasting effort to focus your attention on the Republicans in [ORGANIZATION]. Below is an excellent [PERSON][DATE] explanation by author [ORGANIZATION]1 about how [ORGANIZATION]ional leaders Rs and Ds have subvert[PERSON] the Constitution to advance permanent ruling class control over our government and your money! Hat tip [ORGANIZATION]2 at [ORGANIZATION]7. From [ORGANIZATION]8 sorry to snip so much but please read this and then continue reading the whole article The current battle over whether the [PERSON][DATE] [ORGANIZATION] should de-fund [PERSON]care or not substitute [PERSON]5s battle over refugee funding [PERSON] is the latest instance in which the [LOCATION] mechanism is being us[PERSON] on behalf of a big government program the demise of which would be certain were [ORGANIZATION] to play its Constitutional role by following its regular order as the keeper of the peoples purse - a role fundamental to democracy. Herewith, a brief explanation of how new the [LOCATION] system of funding the GPE20 government is, and how radically subversive of republican government. Important to GPE12 as [PERSON]cares fate may be, the current battles stake is nothing less than whether the people can control government through their representatives or whether government can define its own scope and powers. Since [PERSON]18, the first and most basic restraint on arbitrary government has been the peoples power to decide how much money the government will spend, and for what purposes. The GPE20 Constitution puts it this [STREET] No money shall be drawn from the ORG90 but in consequence of [ORGANIZATION] made by law Art. I sect.9. Nowa[PERSON]s however our bipartisan ruling class limits the [ORGANIZATION] opportunity to approve, disapprove, or modify what the government does, to voting on Continuing [ORGANIZATION] Resolutions - single, all-inclusive bills craft[PERSON] behind clos[PERSON] doors. Then it cynically asks the peoples representatives will you agree to laws no one has read, to programs on the continuation of which you have not vot[PERSON], and to regulations that havent been written yet, or will you shut down the government? This turns democracy into a choice between tyranny and anarchy. Until [PERSON]19, [PERSON]s had taken seriously the relationship between appropriations and democracy. [ORGANIZATION]6 and [ORGANIZATION]7 us[PERSON] to divide the [LOCATION] departments requests for funds and programs into multiple categories and sub-categories. Then many committees and subcommittees held hearings on each item, follow[PERSON] by mark-up sessions in which each would be modifi[PERSON] and vot[PERSON] on. Thereafter, the full [ORGANIZATION]6 and [ORGANIZATION]7 would debate, amend, approve or disapprove them, one by one. This was regular order - more or less as describ[PERSON] in civics books. This chang[PERSON] at first gradually in the [ORGANIZATION]5s, when Democrats and Republicans who were resisting the [ORGANIZATION]4 Administrations efforts to trim government figur[PERSON] out that individual appropriations bills delay[PERSON] until the end of the [ORGANIZATION]2 could be roll[PERSON] together into omnibus bills. These could be advertis[PERSON] as merely continuing the current [PERSON]17 programs and spending levels. In reality, these all-in-one bills 1 protect[PERSON] current programs from scrutiny, amendment, or repeal 2 were stuff[PERSON] with new favors, programs, provisions and priorities that could not have surviv[PERSON] an open process . the Republican leadership, by acquiescing in the practice of funding the government by [PERSON] rather than by individual appropriations has emasculat[PERSON] the most virile means by which mankind has ever limit[PERSON] government More[DATE]1 Nets Blackout [ORGANIZATION] Admitting Ineffectiveness of [PERSON] Deal[DATE]2 ORG91 [ORGANIZATION]7 [DATE], [PERSON]2 When the [PERSON] administration finish[PERSON] constructing the [PERSON] nuclear agreement the public was told, and the liberal m[PERSON]ia support[PERSON], claims that the deal would lead to smoother negotiations and interactions with the country. Now, under questioning from [ORGANIZATION], the [PERSON] administration is allowing for the possibility that they were wrong, announc[PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] anchor PERSON5 Tues[PERSON], And that the nuclear deal may be making the behavior of the [PERSON]ian regime worse. Even with such a shocking change in position the Big Three networks fail[PERSON] to report it. After noting some of the recent aggressive confrontations perpetrat[PERSON] by [PERSON] in LOC7 against GPE20 forces, [ORGANIZATION] Chief GPE29 Correspondent PERSON37 [ORGANIZATION]5 report[PERSON] the [PERSON] administrations stunning admission. Now for the first time, the [PERSON] administration admits the presidents signature foreign policy initiative, the [PERSON] nuclear deal, which went into effect in DATE76, could be worsening, not improving, [PERSON]s behavior, [ORGANIZATION]5 report[PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION]5 ask[PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] spokesperson [ORGANIZATION]6 if he can rule out the [PERSON] Deal as a cause of the increas[PERSON] hostility. I cant rule that out. [PERSON], like many countries has an internal political process thats defin[PERSON] by a lot of different dynamics, [ORGANIZATION]7 respond[PERSON] to the [ORGANIZATION] journalist. He not[PERSON] that [ORGANIZATION]7s statement is a departure from the administrations usual position, since on [PERSON]4 ORG94 Commander, General [ORGANIZATION]9 stat[PERSON] to the press, I would say we havent seen a significant change in their behavior. According to [ORGANIZATION]5, this admission comes as new details are emerging of [PERSON]s dealing with ORG95 during the hunt for PERSON80 and beyond The picture of an embolden[PERSON] [PERSON] emerges as lawmakers have begun examining a small set of documents from the PERSON80 archive that [ORGANIZATION] captur[PERSON] in the raid that kill[PERSON] the ORG95 chief in [PERSON]5.

The probe comes on the heels of an internal government report determining that the [ORGANIZATION] provid[PERSON] hundr[PERSON]s of thousands to an organization that plott[PERSON] to unseat PERSON84 in the countrys [PERSON]3 election. [PERSON] administration officials were found to have delet[PERSON] emails[DATE]5 from [ORGANIZATION] accounts containing information about its relationship with [ORGANIZATION]01, the non-profit group that l[PERSON] the effort. [ORGANIZATION]01, which was award[PERSON] 465,000 in GPE21 grants through [PERSON]7, has been under congressional investigation[DATE]6 since [PERSON]3, when it was first accus[PERSON] of funneling some of that money to partisan political groups looking to unseat PERSON84. This type of behavior by non-profit groups is prohibit[PERSON] under GPE21 tax law. A group of nine leading lawmakers l[PERSON] by Sen. [PERSON], GPE73 are now formally petitioning the [ORGANIZATION] to come clean about the effort and provide answers about how GPE21 taxpayer dollars were permitt[PERSON] to be spent on an organization working against the elect[PERSON] leader of GPE12s closest [ORGANIZATION] ally, according to a readout of the investigation obtain[PERSON] by [ORGANIZATION]02. [ORGANIZATION] officials fail[PERSON] to properly vet the [ORGANIZATION]01 grant proposal because they fail[PERSON] to properly conduct an analysis of risks in the pre-award phase, the senators wrote in a letter to Secretary of [ORGANIZATION]. Unfortunately, it seems that inconsistency and apathy toward oversight of such grants at the [ORGANIZATION] is not new. Our aid dollars should be going toward solving real problems, not contributing to the destabilization of alli[PERSON] governments. The lawmakers including Sens. PERSON86 R., [PERSON]7, PERSON87 R., GPE74, PERSON88 R., [PERSON], PERSON89, [PERSON], and PERSON90 R., GPE73 among others wrote that the [ORGANIZATION] turn[PERSON] a blind eye to [ORGANIZATION]01s highly partisan activities and fail[PERSON] to perform proper oversight about how GPE21 funds were being spent by the group. [ORGANIZATION] officials utterly fail[PERSON] to follow establish[PERSON] proc[PERSON]ures and guidelines to properly identify, mitigate, or guard against any risk that [ORGANIZATION]01 would misuse these funds before, during, and after the grant period, the letter said. As a direct result of these failures, [ORGANIZATION]01 was able to use the more than 300,000 grant to build campaign infrastructure and resources which later were deploy[PERSON] in support of a negative campaign against Prime Minister [PERSON], his [ORGANIZATION]04, and the democratically elect[PERSON] coalition government of GPE76 during the [PERSON]3 GPE76i parliamentary election. [ORGANIZATION] officials were aware of [ORGANIZATION]01s partisan activities, but still permitt[PERSON] the grant money to be award[PERSON], according to the senators, who are pushing for the administration to take disciplinary action against the officials involv[PERSON]. More[DATE]7 [PERSON] Resetting His Own Foreign Policy[DATE]8 GPE12 now mainly retakes ground that we and our allies once held. Now if only we could get [PERSON] to reset his refugee and immigration policies PERSON59 [PERSON] ORG9al Review [ORGANIZATION]7 [DATE], [PERSON]2 If actions speak louder than words, then Barack [PERSON] has been systematically admitting the failure of his own foreign policy. With the notable very notable exception of his [PERSON] policy, his actions over [PERSON]9 reveal an increasingly aggressive military approach to our foes and geopolitical rivals, along with increas[PERSON] military support for key allies. Just DATE75, [LOCATION] and GPE76 sign[PERSON] the largest military-assistance deal in [PERSON] history, a [PERSON]31, 38 billion pact that should help guarantee [PERSON] qualitative military advantage in the [ORGANIZATION] for the foreseeable future. For all the pressure and tension between the [PERSON] administration and the PERSON84 government, [PERSON] is leaving office with no two-state solution and no peace deal but rather security assistance that will long outlast the memory of any political tension or rivalry. At the same time, [PERSON] ground troops maintain their presence in GPE[DATE] and have slowly ramp[PERSON] back up in GPE18, with alli[PERSON] forces massing for a decisive battle for [ORGANIZATION], a fight that could effectively push [ORGANIZATION]06 out of every major [ORGANIZATION] population center. [PERSON] special forces are engag[PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION] and GPE78, and bombing raids are hitting terrorist targets from GPE[DATE] to GPE18 to [ORGANIZATION] to GPE15. In [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] has quadrupl[PERSON] military spending and bolster[PERSON] [PERSON] support for the [LOCATION] states. The GPE29 [ORGANIZATION]09 characteriz[PERSON] the joint [ORGANIZATION]08 effort as pouring tanks, warplanes and soldiers into the region. In the other words, the [ORGANIZATION]5s call[PERSON], and they have their foreign policy back. As the [ORGANIZATION]09 describes, [ORGANIZATION]n and Western officials make clear that they are settling into a confrontation that neither side expects to end quickly. Its difficult to overstate the gap between this new military reality and the hope and promise of the [PERSON] candidacy. He was going to end wars. He was going to reset relations with [ORGANIZATION]. Even as late as [PERSON]32, he was trumpeting the success of his approach. [PERSON] troops were home from GPE18, PERSON80 was dead, and all seem[PERSON] mainly quiet on the [ORGANIZATION]n front. While [PERSON] pacifism was always exaggerat[PERSON] he did, for example, order a surge in GPE[DATE], wag[PERSON] stepp[PERSON]-up drone campaigns, and bomb[PERSON] the PERSON93 regime into oblivion, at the heart of his ideology was the notion that certain [PERSON] actions creat[PERSON] a series of legitimate grievances in the Muslim world and beyond. In other words, [PERSON] actions had provid[PERSON] jihadists with pretexts for war and material for recruitment. By reversing course, decreasing our military footprint, and ending the most controversial of PERSON94-era programs, we could isolate the extremists, cultivate relationships with alleg[PERSON]ly more reasonable Islamists witness the aggressive courtship of [PERSON]0 [ORGANIZATION]0 and of GPE78n revolutionaries, and refocus [PERSON] resources on domestic problems. The result was tragic. [PERSON] withdrawal creat[PERSON] a series of power vacuums largely fill[PERSON] by [PERSON] enemies. By throwing away the GPE18 victory, [PERSON] creat[PERSON] space not merely for the re-emergence of [ORGANIZATION]1 in GPE18 since renam[PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]06, he permitt[PERSON] [PERSON] to exert ever greater levels of control even over our remaining [ORGANIZATION] allies, and his light-footprint GPE78 campaign help[PERSON] turn that nation into a cauldron of jihadist violence and unrest. A reset was essentially mandatory. And to the extent that [PERSON] keeps ignoring the lessons of the very recent past, there will be more resets to come. By [PERSON]7, [PERSON] foreign policy was in a state of near-collapse.

buffalo,2020-09-02T00:00:00Z,The Volokh Conspiracy,WNY,homeless,[ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] Could set a Dangerous Precedent,"The income cutoff of 99,000 for an individual taxpayer is far above the national poverty [ORGANIZATION], and indeed far above the median national household income of 61,9373. which includes numerous multi-person households. The requirement that the eviction would likely render the individual homelessor force the individual to move into and live in close quarters in a new congregate or shared living setting could potentially apply to any situation where the evicted person ends up living in a new home with at least one other person. Having a roommate including a family member surely counts as a shared living setting. Thus, the measure would protect from potential eviction large numbers of people who are clearly not poor, and would not end up homeless if evicted.Such sweeping action by the executive normally at least requires authorization by [ORGANIZATION]. As co-blogger [ORGANIZATION] explains, the claimed authorization here is 42 CFR Section 70.2 a regulation5 that gives the Director of the [ORGANIZATION] the power to take such measures to prevent such spread of the communicable diseases as heshe deems reasonably necessary, including inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, and destruction of animals or articles believed to be sources of infection. The [ORGANIZATION] can take such measures anywhere it deems local and state regulations to be insufficient to limit the spread of disease across state borders.Section 70.2 is itself just a regulation, not a law enacted by [ORGANIZATION] so there may be some question as to whether it itself has legislative authorization. Assuming Section 70.2 does have such authorization, the ORG2 may be overreaching when it claims that it permits a sweeping nationwide eviction moratorium.As [PERSON] notes, the possible measures listed in the regulationinspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, and destruction of animals or articles believed to be sources of infection are all relatively narrowly targeted policies focused on specific sources of infection, not wide-ranging nationwide regulations that apply regardless of how much danger there is in the particular location. [ORGANIZATION], a standard canon of legal interpretation, requires that a list of items in a law should be interpreted as being of the same kind as others on list. Here, everything on the list seems to be relatively limited in scope. Thus, the regulation only permits narrowly targeted, localized restrictions.On the other hand, the administration can argue that these specific examples are just meant to be illustrative and all they really have in common with each other is that they are all examples of measures that might be thought reasonably necessary to limit the spread of disease. On that theory, Section 70.2 would allow the [ORGANIZATION] to impose almost any regulation it wanted, so long as there is some minimally plausible argument that it would limit the spread of a communicable disease.And note that, under the text of the regulation, the [ORGANIZATION] need not prove that the regulations in question really are reasonably necessary or that state restrictions really are insufficient. They need only assert deem that such is the case.This broad interpretation of the regulation would give the executive the power to restrict almost any type of activity. Pretty much any economic transaction or movement of people and goods could potentially spread disease in some [STREET]. Nor is that authority limited to particularly deadly diseases such as [PERSON]-19. It could just as readily apply to virtually any other communicable disease, such as the flu or even the common cold.DATE0, thousands of people die because of the flu, and restrictions on mobility or on economic and social activity could be seen as reasonable ways to limit its spread. 42 [ORGANIZATION] on which the definition of disease in Section 70.2 is based in fact defines communicable diseases as illnesses due to infectious agents or their toxic products, which may be transmitted from a reservoir to a susceptible host either directly as from an infected person or animal or indirectly through the agency of an intermediate plant or animal host, vector, or the inanimate environment. Notice that this applies to any disease spread by infectious agents, regardless of severity. The flu and the common cold clearly [PERSON] can use this authority to impose a nationwide eviction moratorium, PERSON3 or some other future president could use it to impose a nationwide mask mandate, a nationwide lockdown, or just about any other restriction of any activity that could potentially reduce the spread of the flu, the common cold, or any other disease.Such virtually limitless executive authority to impose restrictions and mandates would make a hash of the separation of powers, enabling the president to circumvent [ORGANIZATION]s authority on a massive scale. It also would completely undermine any semblance of nondelegation restrictions on grants of power to the executive. If Section 70.2 is authorized by [ORGANIZATION] and has the broad scope the administration claims, it would virtually gut nondelegation. If [ORGANIZATION] can delegate the power to suppress virtually any activity of any kind, so long as the [ORGANIZATION] claims that doing so is reasonably necessary to reduce the spread of disease, it is hard to see how any meaningful limits on delegation would remain.There are similar problems with the administrations ultrabroad interpretations of statutes delegating power over immigration8 and trade9. But extending such arguments to the suppression of purely domestic economic and social activity further exacerbates the danger.The administrations position threatens federalism, as much as separation of powers. If the executive can suppress pretty much any type of local activity so long as the [ORGANIZATION] claims that it risks transmitting contagious diseases and state law is insufficient, it can intrude in numerous areas of public policy that would otherwise be left to state or local control. At the very least, displacement of state or local power by the the feds would require congressional legislation, not just executive whim. Conservatives who may think such power can safely be entrusted to [ORGANIZATION] will not be happy the next time a Democrat wields it, as could well happen [LOCATION] sweeping nationwide eviction moratorium is also a massive infringement on private property rights. Landlords may be stuck holding the bag for numerous tenants who refuse to pay. This is yet another addition to the [ORGANIZATION] administrations already terribl10e record on property rights.[PERSON] Blackman posits11 that [ORGANIZATION] will eventually enact legislation compensating landlords. But it is far from clear that will actually happen, and especially if it will happen fast enough to keep many smaller landlords from falling into dire financial straits. The same goes for efforts to recoup unpaid rent from tenants when the moratorium ends.Moreover, whoever wins the presidential election might have strong political incentives to extend the moratorium for [ORGANIZATION] to come. After all, the broad power implied by the administrations interpretation of Section 70.2 does not impose any time limits, or any limitations based on the severity of the disease threat the regulations are supposedly combating. Even after a [PERSON] vaccine is discovered and deployed, the administration could potentially argue that continuing the moratorium is necessary, because the vaccine may not be 100 effective, and thus some disease risk remainsLandlords could potentially recoup their losses by filing lawsuits under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In my view, this sort of measure probably should be considered a taking. But courts have been [LOCATION] to rule that state-imposed rent moratoria are takings, and the same deference is likely to be applied to a federal policy.The administrations immigration restrictions are currently being challenged on nondelegation grounds13, and similar lawsuits will likely be filed against the eviction moratorium. Hopefully, the plaintiffs will prevail in both cases. That may be the best prospect for overturning this measure in [STREET].Alternatively, the canon against interpreting statutes in ways that raise constitutional problems will lead courts to interpret Section 70.2 and its authorizing statute narrowly, thereby invalidating the moratorium, but preserving the statutes and regulations as sources of authority for more narrowly targeted public health measures.Some might argue that this action will not set a dangerous precedent because the authority to impose moratoria and other restrictions created by Section 70.2 is given to the head of the [ORGANIZATION], an expert agency that is supposed to be guided by scientific evidence, not political or ideological imperatives. But the [ORGANIZATION] is hardly immune to political pressure from the president and other politicians, as shown by a variety of instances14 where the [ORGANIZATION] administration has bent the agency to its [DATE]. It is likely that political pressure played a significant role in this policy, as well. Moreover, even the most expert bureaucrats often have political agendas of their own. Rarely, if ever, is there such a thing as public health policy determined purely by technical scientific considerations without reference to morality or ideology.Finally, it is worth noting that this sweeping moratorium is unnecessary, as well as illegal. There is no massive eviction crisis in [ORGANIZATION]. To the contrary, eviction rates have been below normal levels since the start of the [ORGANIZATION] crisis in [LOCATION], as was also true during previous recessions16. And that has been the case even in areas where there are no local eviction moratoria. Barring extreme malfeasance of some kind, most landlords do not want to evict tenants during an economic crisis, if only because they know it will be hard to get new ones able to pay as much or more.If the federal government nonetheless imposes sweeping eviction moratoria, that will incentivize landlords to raise rents or take on fewer tenants in the future, in order to guard against such policies. That will predictably reduce the available housing stock for tenants, especially the poor. The same goes if landlords have to leave the industry because they go bankrupt or otherwise lose large amounts of money.To the extent that some kind government assistance for needy tenants is desirable during an economic crisis, it is best-provided in the more targeted form of subsidies for poor tenants who otherwise cannot pay, not sweeping eviction moratoria that apply to millions of non-poor tenants, and leave landlords holding the bag.UPDATE I have made a few minor additions to this post.  1  2 [URL]2Fpoverty-guidelinesamp38usgAOvVaw3kZ5BplStiTJtaiW1ZWXLD  3  4  5  6  7 38height800amp38iframetrueamp38def_id5061ca87e892937e109dd[PHONE]aamp38term_occur999amp38term_srcTitle42ChapterISubchapterFPart7070.2  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15 185a49801f8b  16"

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for [TIME] equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of [ORGANIZATION]. The gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] Mr. [PERSON] and the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] each will control DATE24 minutes. The [PERSON] recognizes the gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] Mr. [PERSON]. General Leave Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I ask unanimous consent that all Members have DATE10 in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials on [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from [ORGANIZATION]? There was no objection. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. [PERSON], I rise in support of [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. When President [PERSON] signed the [PERSON] Act in [DATE], our country codified the basic idea that all workers should earn equal pay for equal work, regardless of sex. Regrettably, [PERSON] and after the passage of the [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act, that promise remains unfulfilled. DATE1[DATE], women continue to be paid, on average, 82 cents on the dollar compared to men. This wage disparity is far worse for women of color, who make less than [ORGANIZATION] men and [ORGANIZATION] women. It exists across every sector, regardless of education, experience, occupation, industry or job title. A recent [ORGANIZATION] study found that [DATE]8 to [DATE] percent of the gender wage gap is unexplained and likely due to discrimination. Drawn out over DATE[DATE], the persistent wage gap could cost a woman anywhere from 400,000 to 2 million. This impacts both workers and their families, often meaning the difference between financial stability and perpetual hardship. [ORGANIZATION] offers an opportunity to finally secure equal pay for equal work. The bill strengthens the [PERSON] Act by bolstering workers rights to discuss their wages with coworkers and making it easier for workers to join class action lawsuits enhancing the enforcement tools available to [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]9 and, more importantly, by [PERSON] H1802 closing loopholes for employer defenses and requiring employers to prove pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons. The [PERSON] administration has issued a [ORGANIZATION]ment of ORG22 Policy in support of this bill. It states Ensuring equal pay is essential to advancing [ORGANIZATION]n values of fairness and equity. Then it adds [ORGANIZATION] is commonsense legislation that would strengthen the [PERSON] Act and give workers more tools to [ORGANIZATION]ht sex-based pay discrimination. Mr. [PERSON], I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 the [ORGANIZATION]ment of ORG22 Policy of [ORGANIZATION]0. [ORGANIZATION]ment of ORG22 Policy [ORGANIZATION]0--Paycheck Fairness Act--Rep. [PERSON], D-GPE[DATE], and 22[DATE] cosponsors The ORG22 strongly supports [ORGANIZATION] passage of [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. Ensuring equal pay is essential to advancing [ORGANIZATION]n values of fairness and equity. Women lose thousands of dollars [ORGANIZATION], and hundreds of thousands over DATE[DATE], because of the gender and racial wage gap. Women working full-time, DATE16 in [PERSON] earned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men working full-time DATE16, and these disparities are greater for women of color. Pay inequity also impacts individuals who face intersecting forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, including LGBTQ individuals. Due to the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic, millions of women have dropped out of the labor force, partly reflecting the increased domestic labor demands on women. Caregiving demands often fall disproportionately on women, which leads to many women having to reduce their [TIME], resulting in lower earnings. As more and more [ORGANIZATION]n families rely on womens income, the pay gap hurts not only women, but also the families who depend on them. The cumulative impact of wage gaps adds up to financial insecurity over the course of a career for women and their families and for generations who follow. [ORGANIZATION] is commonsense legislation that would strengthen the [PERSON] Act and give workers more tools to [ORGANIZATION]ht sex-based pay discrimination. It would also take major steps toward increasing pay transparency, an essential provision to advance equality in the workplace, by explicitly protecting workers from retaliation for simply discussing their compensation with their colleagues. The bill would also expand opportunities for workers to receive training on effective negotiation skills. The bill would also limit an employers ability to rely on salary history during the hiring process to set pay, or when determining wages for a promotion. [ORGANIZATION]0 would hold employers accountable by closing judicially created loopholes for employer defenses and by adding a class action option under the [ORGANIZATION] Rules of Civil Procedure. The bill would require the collection of pay data to enable better enforcement of laws prohibiting pay discrimination. The ORG22 looks forward to continuing to work with the ORG2 to address pay equity and urges quick action on this landmark bill. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. [PERSON], I rise DATE1[DATE] in opposition to [ORGANIZATION]0, the Democrats conveniently titled, but painfully misguided, Paycheck Fairness Act, which should be called the paychecks for trial lawyers act. We all agree on the fundamental principle of this bill women should not be paid less than men for the same work. That is not up for debate and, for me, it has never been up for debate and, for our country, it hasnt been since [DATE], when the [PERSON] Act amended the Fair [ORGANIZATION] Standards Act, making equal pay the law of the land. Moreover, in DATE18, title VII of the Civil Rights Act codified nondiscrimination rules for employment, making it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, and sex. The question before us DATE1[DATE] is whether the Democrats Paycheck Fairness Act provides any additional protections to women in the workplace. The answer is a resounding no. The United [ORGANIZATION]s has some of the most varied and complex workplaces in the world. Before the onslaught of [ORGANIZATION], women were earning merited paychecks in record numbers. According to a ORG2[DATE] analysis and numerous other studies, the difference in earning between men and women comes down to choices made regarding careers and parenting. Many working women take advantage of flexible work schedules to meet their diverse needs. A survey by [ORGANIZATION] found [DATE] percent of working mothers say that a flexible schedule is extremely important. Democrats arent giving the full story when they talk about pay differences. Women are making career choices that are best for themselves and their families. Limiting their freedom to do so is wrong. ORG2 has no [STREET] in telling women their career choices are wrong, yet Democrats are hellbent on telling all [ORGANIZATION]ns how to live their lives, how to spend their money, and now how to make career decisions. [ORGANIZATION] is not a win for women in the slightest. It is a false promise that creates opportunities and advantages only for trial lawyers looking for easy payouts while causing irreparable harm to employers. By making it much easier to bring lawsuits of questionable validity against employers, trial lawyers will be able to force employers into settlements or try for unlimited paydays from jury awards, lining their own pockets and dragging women through tedious, never-ending legal proceedings. In [PERSON], we believe in innocence until proven guilty, but this bill assumes otherwise. Under current law, business owners can defend themselves from a claim of pay discrimination by proving that a pay differential is based on legitimate, business-related factors other than sex. [ORGANIZATION]0 would radically alter this law, requiring a business owner to convince a judge or jury that the pay differential was required by business necessity. This is a nearly impossible burden of proof to meet that will lead to unfair judgments against business owners because the plain meaning of the term business necessity is that the pay differential must be absolutely essential to the business. [ORGANIZATION]0 would also result in a flood of litigation in front of judges and juries, who will delve into employer compensation decisions even when the employer can demonstrate that those decisions are based on legitimate, business-related reasons having nothing to do with the sex of the employee. [ORGANIZATION] and liability risks that could leave them bankrupt, many business owners will likely implement rigid pay bands--a model used by government and unionized businesses. This means workers will not be compensated on the basis of merit. This is the opposite of the [ORGANIZATION]n Dream. As one columnist wrote equality of opportunity--not outcomes--is the [ORGANIZATION]n ideal. On top of the legal jeopardy this bill creates for employers, [ORGANIZATION]0 also mandates that business owners submit mountains of worker pay data to the [ORGANIZATION] Government. This will pose significant threats to the confidentiality and privacy of workers pay data, create a data stash that would be impossible to protect or interpret, and cost business owners more than 600 million DATE19. This bill purports to champion equality for women, yet it disregards the 40 percent of small businesses owned by women that will be forced to implement pay policies found in government-run workplaces and be stuck paying through the nose in compliance costs if this bill passes. Even worse, [ORGANIZATION]0 will severely limit workplace flexibility for women. Many working women take advantage of flexible work schedules to meet their diverse needs, yet this harmful legislation completely ignores this reality and threatens to take away the choices and freedom necessary for them to retain employment. We know employees prefer workable and flexible schedules, and now is not the time to limit these options for women who have been hit particularly hard by the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic. Should my Democrat colleagues wish to discuss additional policies which will foster the advancement of women in the workplace, we can consider legislation that safely reopens our schools and businesses, provides the flexibility and support to expand work-based learning programs and create viable pathways that enable more individuals to reskill and build fulfilling careers on their own terms, and promotes career and technical education, to name a few. Unfortunately, my Democrat colleagues would rather impose radical [PERSON] H180[DATE] and unworkable policy under the guise of progress than find bipartisan solutions which foster environments where individuals are empowered to succeed and make the decisions that are best for them. Mr. [PERSON], I urge a no vote on [ORGANIZATION]0, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], who is the Assistant [PERSON] of the [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] of [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], in DATE20, [ORGANIZATION]n women lost 1[DATE]6,000 jobs, accounting for 100 percent of jobs lost and since the start of this pandemic, nearly [DATE] million women have been pushed out of the workforce. Women have borne the brunt of the economic crisis brought on by this pandemic, and gender pay inequality is at the root of the problem. DATE21 after the passage of the [PERSON] Act, women still only make 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, and that gap is even wider for women of color. By passing [ORGANIZATION] DATE1[DATE], we are correcting this injustice and ensuring that all people receive equal pay for equal work. Lets be clear this isnt a womens issue. Pay inequity hurts children, families, and our entire economy. It is fundamental to our recovery and our ability to not just rebuild to status quo, but to rebuild a just and inclusive [ORGANIZATION] for all. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] Mr. [PERSON]0. Mr. [PERSON]1 of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I thank [PERSON] Member [PERSON] for yielding. Mr. [PERSON], everyone supports equal pay for equal performance, and everyone is against gender-based wage discrimination. This has been the law for DATE22. When I entered the workforce DATE2[DATE] after college, wage discrimination was basically nonexistent, thanks to the law and a simple recognition of the value of a diverse workforce. Companies then, as now, simply assigned a starting salary based upon the position, and paid that wage to everyone they hired thereafter providing merit increases based upon performance, unlike what happens in union shops and with government positions. But do my Democrat friends across the aisle base their staff salaries on gender? Or do they pay women less than men? Or do they set salaries based on market conditions, qualifications, and experience? time [DATE] Why do they assume less of private employers? We already have laws and protections that ensure fair pay, and companies must maintain documentation demonstrating nondiscrimination in wages, performance evaluations, and merit increases. In fact, we are in a much stronger position DATE1[DATE] than we were DATE24, let alone DATE2[DATE]. This legislation from ORG2[DATE] is just another attempt to insert themselves further into the workplace with a purported cure for a disease that doesnt exist. Democrats are dependent upon the perception of discrimination and victimhood to expand their base of power as they continue to divide us as a GPE88. Democrats also view employers, businesses, and job creators with disdain, believing that, left to their own devices, they would seek to harm and exploit their employees. Not to worry, [ORGANIZATION] to the rescue or, more accurately, big Democrat government laying on more control, more regulations, more mandates, all designed to enrich their trial lawyer friends and increase liability for employers. The Democrats will disingenuously cite statistics that indicate that there are discrepancies in income based on gender, but they wont specify discrepancies in pay for the same positions in the same industries because they dont exist. This bill adds more layers of burdensome and costly reporting requirements for businesses, estimated to cost about 600 million a DATE[DATE][DATE], costs which will be passed on to consumers in higher prices with no real benefit. The bill doesnt do anything to help women in the workplace, but it hurts employers, exposing them to greater liability, and enriches the trial lawyer donors to ORG2[DATE]. It allows the lawyers to litigate every decision an employer makes, and to bankrupt small businesses by seeking unlimited monetary damages. It makes it impossible for employers to defend charges of gender- based discrimination when experience, qualifications, or performance warrants higher pay. They would now need to prove that the determination is a business necessity. Leave it to politicians in GPE[DATE] to think that they have the right to determine for employers what is a business necessity. Left to themselves, businesses and employers tend to get it right. But [ORGANIZATION] almost never gets it right, and this bill is no exception. I urge a no vote. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], the sponsor of the bill, a champion for equal pay, and the chair of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]2. Mr. [PERSON], I rise in strong support of [ORGANIZATION], legislation that I have introduced in every ORG2 since [DATE]. Since then, we have pushed and battled to strengthen the [PERSON] Act of [DATE]. We launched, side by side, into the fray to elevate pay discrimination, to emphasize how central its impact is to working families. I cannot tell you how difficult it has been to break through on something so simple so simple. Men and women in the same job deserve the same pay. It is a principle that we adhere to in this ORG2, and I dont believe anyone would challenge it. The same is true of the [PERSON] military. DATE2[DATE], we recognized DATE28 on DATE29, which is [ORGANIZATION]0 into [ORGANIZATION]1 that women must work to meet the wages earned by men in [ORGANIZATION]2. ORG2[DATE] tells us, at its lowest point in [ORGANIZATION][DATE], full-time, working women earned a median of [DATE]6.6 cents to every dollar that full-time working men earned. DATE1[DATE], women who work full- time, DATE16 are paid, on average, only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. The gap exists in every [ORGANIZATION], regardless of geography, occupation, education, or work patterns. And it is worse for women of color. [PERSON] are typically paid [DATE][DATE] cents Native [ORGANIZATION]n women 60 cents [PERSON]4 women [DATE] cents Asian [ORGANIZATION]n and [LOCATION] women are paid as little as [DATE]2 cents. This wage disparity costs the average [ORGANIZATION]n woman and her family an estimated 400,000 to 2 million, impacting ORG28 benefits and pensions. DATE1[DATE], the issue and the environment have collided. This pandemic has brought out the depth of our problem, exposed existing inequalities, and threatened womens economic security at a disproportionate rate. Women have lost more than five million jobs and as we seek to rebuild our economy, let us remember that the pay gap hurts not only women, but also the families who depend on them. [ORGANIZATION] is a bipartisan piece of legislation, which has the support of every member of [LOCATION], as well as three Republicans. It would toughen the remedies in the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] to give [ORGANIZATION]s working women the opportunity to [ORGANIZATION]ht wage discrimination and receive the paycheck they have rightfully earned. It would require employers to prove that pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons ban retaliation against workers who discuss their wages it facilitates a wronged workers participation in a class action suit and it prohibits employers from seeking the salary history of prospective employees. And by now, we are all familiar with the case of [PERSON][DATE]. Her bosses said Their plant did not need women that women did not help, and, in fact, they caused problems. Well, a jury found that, yes, [PERSON][DATE] had been discriminated against, and awarded her [DATE].8 million in back pay and damages, which [PERSON]0 eliminated. She received nothing, as it closed the courtroom door to all women. We, the ORG2, reopened that door with the [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act. It reversed [PERSON]0s decision. It was a [STREET] access case, but it [PERSON] H1804 did not address the underlying issue of pay discrimination. President [PERSON]4 in [ORGANIZATION]4, in his [ORGANIZATION] of the Union address, said Legislation to apply the principle of equal pay for equal work without discrimination because of sex is a matter of simple justice. I earnestly urge the ORG2 to move swiftly to implement these needed labor measures. When President [PERSON] signed the [PERSON] Act into law [ORGANIZATION][DATE], he said It is a first step. It affirms our determination that when women enter the labor force, they will find equality in their pay envelopes. [ORGANIZATION] is the next step. It simply brings the [PERSON] Act into line with the remedies already available for those who are subject to other forms of employment discrimination. That is it, pure and simple. We have passed paycheck fairness through this [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION][DATE], [PERSON]. But, now, in the 11[DATE]th ORG2 in which we welcomed the most women in our history, we must get it into law. We have the opportunity to make good on that promise that Presidents of both parties have made. We need to seize that moment. It is time for us to say that the work that women do in our society DATE1[DATE] is valued and respected, and the contribution that we make, if it is good enough for the women in the [ORGANIZATION], then it is good enough for women all over [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter supporting [ORGANIZATION] by a broad coalition of organizations that promote economic opportunity for women. [ORGANIZATION]8. [ORGANIZATION] Support Swift Passage of [ORGANIZATION] Dear Member of ORG2 As members of a broad coalition of organizations that promote economic opportunity for women and vigorous enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, we strongly urge you to co-sponsor and push for swift passage of [ORGANIZATION] as a top priority of the 11[DATE]th ORG2. Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender pay gaps persist, and earnings lost to these gaps are exacerbating the financial effects of [ORGANIZATION], falling particularly heavily on women of color and the families who depend on their income. This legislation offers a much needed update to the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] by providing new tools to battle pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination. The [ORGANIZATION] pandemic and systemic racism have exposed how the work performed primarily by women, and particularly [PERSON]4 and brown women, has long been and continues to be undervalued and underpaid, even as the rest of the country is newly recognizing the essential nature of this work. [PERSON]4 women, [PERSON], and other women of color are especially likely to be on the front lines of the crisis, risking their lives in jobs in health care, child care, and grocery stores they are also being paid less than their male counterparts. At the same time, women in this country lost more than [DATE] million jobs in [ORGANIZATION]9 indeed, women accounted for 100 of the jobs lost in DATE20 [ORGANIZATION]9. The unemployment rate for [PERSON]4 women and [PERSON] remains exceptionally high. These high jobless numbers threaten to exacerbate gender wage gaps when women regain employment. We cannot build back an economy that works for everyone without ensuring that all women can work with equality, safety, and dignity, starting with pay equity. There is no more fitting [STREET] to begin this session than by making real, concrete progress in ensuring all women receive fair pay. [ORGANIZATION] updates and strengthens the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] to ensure that it provides robust protection against sex-based pay discrimination. Among other provisions, this comprehensive bill bars retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages. It closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work without any important business justification related to the job. It ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity. It prohibits employers from relying on salary history in determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not follow women from job to job. And it also provides much needed training and technical assistance, as well as data collection and research. Women are increasingly the primary or co-breadwinner in their families and cannot afford to be shortchanged any longer. Women working full-time, DATE16 are typically paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. But for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts, [PERSON]4 women only make [DATE] cents, Native women only 60 cents, and [PERSON] only [DATE][DATE] cents. While Asian [ORGANIZATION]n and [LOCATION] [LOCATION] women make 8[DATE] cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, women in many [LOCATION] communities experience drastically wider pay gaps. Furthermore, moms are paid less than dads. And even when controlling for factors, such as education and experience, the pay gaps persist and start early in womens careers and contribute to a wealth gap that follows them throughout their lifetimes. These pay gaps can be addressed only if workers have the legal tools necessary to challenge discrimination and employers are provided with effective incentives and technical assistance to comply with the law. We recently commemorated the twelfth anniversary of the enactment of the [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act. That vital law rectified [PERSON]0s harmful decision in [PERSON][DATE] v. [PERSON]0DATE[DATE][DATE] Tire amp [ORGANIZATION]. The law helps to ensure that individuals subjected to unlawful compensation discrimination are able to have their day in [STREET] and effectively assert their rights under federal antidiscrimination laws. But the [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act, critical as it is, is only one step on the path to ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work. Its time to take the next step toward achieving equal pay. We urge you to prioritize [ORGANIZATION] in the 11[DATE]th ORG2 by co-sponsoring and urging swift passage of this legislation, taking up the cause of [PERSON][DATE] and all those who have fought for equal pay. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact [PERSON]6, Director of [PERSON]4 at [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON][DATE], Vice President for [ORGANIZATION]91 at [PERSON]6.

[ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from GPE[DATE]0 Mrs. [PERSON]8. Mrs. [PERSON]9. Mr. [PERSON], I rise DATE1[DATE] in opposition of [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. We dont need the government telling business how much they can pay their employees. Lets not forget that it is business that has lifted us out of poverty, not the government. As a former businesswoman who has actually signed the front of paychecks, not just the backs, what you do as an employee and what you produce as an employee matters, and what you produce should be reflected in your outcome, not your gender. Do not--please, do not insult me as a woman by lowering the bar for me. And please, do not insult me as a business owner for forcing me to lower the bar for my employees. Outcomes and hard work are what leads to success, not your gender. [ORGANIZATION] discrimination is already against the law thanks to the [PERSON] Act. At a time when businesses are shutting their doors due to the pandemic, we should be creating jobs and incentivizing people to work. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]0, chair of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]1. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and for his support, and for his leadership on the committee. Mr. [PERSON], I rise DATE1[DATE], as I have done for my entire career, from the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION], in support of equal pay for equal work. It is [ORGANIZATION]1, and women are still subject to unequal, unfair compensation in the workplace. This truth, this wage gap is at its worst for women of color. [PERSON]4 women, for example, earn an average of [DATE] cents on the dollar compared to men. This issue persists in nearly every line of work, regardless of education, experience, occupation, industry, or job title. And if you dont believe that data, take it from me. I have lived it. [ORGANIZATION] is an opportunity for ORG2 to strengthen the [PERSON] Act, to bolster the rights of working women, and to put an end to the gender-based wage disparity once and for all. We cannot continue to rob nearly half of our [PERSON] workforce of the wages they deserve, nor can we continue to force women to work far more just to be paid fairly. Mr. [PERSON], I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter from [PERSON] in support of [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. ORG99, [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]1. Dear Member of ORG2 The ORG99 is a non-profit, non-partisan advocacy organization committed to improving the lives of women and families by achieving equity for all women. Since our creation as [ORGANIZATION]49 in [ORGANIZATION][DATE], we have fought for every significant federal advance for equal opportunity in the workplace, including the [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act of [ORGANIZATION][DATE]. We write in strong support of [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION], and urge you to vote for passage while opposing any harmful amendments. This critical bill will help our nation build back an economy that works for everyone by ensuring that all women can work with equality and dignity. As [ORGANIZATION] recognizes, women and workers from communities of color continue to face significant pay disparities in [PERSON]. On average, women working full time and DATE16 are paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, and the wage gap is widest for women of color. Among women who hold full-time, DATE16 jobs in [PERSON], [PERSON]4 women are typically paid [DATE] cents, Native [ORGANIZATION]n women 60 cents and [PERSON] just [DATE][DATE] cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. [ORGANIZATION], non- Hispanic women are paid [DATE]9 cents. Asian [ORGANIZATION]n and [LOCATION] [LOCATION] women who work full time, DATE16 are paid as little as [DATE]2 cents for every dollar paid to white, non- Hispanic men, as Burmese women are. Asian [ORGANIZATION]n women overall are paid just 8[DATE] cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. The wage gap persists across different industries, occupations and education levels and exists in nearly every congressional district. These troubling statistics underscore the need to update our nations equal pay laws. [ORGANIZATION] would make it safe for workers to discuss their wages with each other. Employers can currently mask compensation discrimination with pay secrecy policies that forbid employees from discussing pay and benefits. [ORGANIZATION]recy and the threat of retaliation leave workers unable to learn about and challenge pay disparities. In a survey of private-sector workers, over 62 percent of women and 60 percent of men reported that their employers discourage or prohibit discussing wage and salary information. [ORGANIZATION] would make pay secrecy policies illegal. [ORGANIZATION] would also prohibit employers from screening job applicants based on their salary history or requiring salary history during the interview process. Women are typically paid lower wages than men even in their first jobs. [PERSON] disparities that begin early in a womans career can follow her from job to job when employers are permitted to base a new hires salary on her prior earnings. People should be paid fairly for the job they are being hired to do. The bill would also make it more difficult for employers to justify pay discrimination. Workers in the same company who do the same job and have the same amount of experience, education and training should be paid the same. Currently, however, employers are able to explain away differences in pay too easily by relying on a catch-all defense in the [PERSON] Act. [ORGANIZATION] would close that loophole and require employers to prove that any differences in pay are not sex-based, are job-related concerning the position in question, and are consistent with business necessity and account for the entire difference in compensation. Employees claiming pay discrimination would also have new opportunities to prove that the employers defense is the pretext. In addition to these critical provisions, [ORGANIZATION] would also allow workers alleging pay discrimination within the same company to file class-action suits would change the remedies of the [PERSON] Act to treat gender-based pay discrimination claims the same as other civil rights violations that result in unfair pay would recognize companies that want to do better and would improve fair pay enforcement, data collection and disclosure. Closing the gender and racial wage gap is a crucial measure to take in response to [ORGANIZATION]. Throughout the pandemic, women and people of color have disproportionately experienced the adverse effects of the public health and economic crisis. Women and people of color have been on the front lines working in our most essential occupations, but forces like wage inequality have kept them underpaid and undervalued. [ORGANIZATION] would ensure that workers are given the support needed to ensure pay equity during this time of crisis. Updating our nations equal pay laws is also crucial to reducing negative impacts resulting from the mass exodus of women from the labor force during the pandemic. Womens labor force participation is at a [ORGANIZATION]4 record low, with nearly a million moms having left the workforce, largely due to the difficulties of balancing full-time work and care responsibilities. Increases in womens labor force participation rates drove the significant narrowing of the gender wage gap during [ORGANIZATION][DATE] and [ORGANIZATION]6, a narrowing which stagnated in [ORGANIZATION][DATE], around the time womens labor force participation peaked. Without [ORGANIZATION], progress on closing the gender wage gap could be set back [ORGANIZATION]8, especially since women face financial penalties for taking time out of the workforce, with one study finding that women who took just [ORGANIZATION] out of the workforce had [ORGANIZATION] earnings [DATE]9 percent lower than women who did not. [PERSON] H1806 [ORGANIZATION] would strengthen existing federal protections, ensure more equitable workplaces and allow women to remain in the workforce and maintain their economic stability at all phases of life. At the current rate of progress, projections are that the gender wage gap will close in DATE[DATE]1 for Asian women, [DATE] for white women, [DATE] for [PERSON]4 women, and [DATE] for [ORGANIZATION] women. Women cannot--and should not--wait that long for pay equity. It is time to clarify and strengthen existing federal protections for women in the workforce by passing [ORGANIZATION]. We urge you to vote in support and opposed harmful amendments. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentleman from [PERSON][DATE] Mr. [PERSON]2. Mr. [PERSON][DATE]. Mr. [PERSON], I rise DATE1[DATE] in opposition to [ORGANIZATION]0. This bill is a solution in search of a problem, and it does nothing to help employees. In reality, the bill would only boost paychecks for trial lawyers and not workers. [ORGANIZATION]0 places unworkable, burdensome restrictions on employers, and also poses a threat to worker privacy. Even more, this bill would kill the DATE[DATE]2 bonus by effectively prohibiting employers from paying end-of-the-DATE[DATE][DATE] bonuses to their employees. This hardly seems fair to an employee, despite the title of the bill. Republicans tried to strengthen the bill during the committee markup. My colleague, [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]4, offered an amendment that would have made commonsense improvements to the text, but that amendment was rejected by the Democrats. I urge a no vote on the bill. We should not allow trial lawyers and burdensome restrictions to kill the DATE[DATE]2 bonus under the false guise of fairness. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], this bill will prohibit paying all the men a bonus and none of the women a bonus, although they have produced equally for the business. I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [PERSON]9 Mrs. [PERSON][DATE], a distinguished member of [ORGANIZATION]. Mrs. [PERSON]6. Mr. [PERSON], I rise DATE1[DATE] in support of [ORGANIZATION]. I want to commend [PERSON]woman Rosa [PERSON] for her extraordinary efforts and commend [PERSON]man [PERSON] for bringing this timely policy to fruition. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of [ORGANIZATION]. I think most of us can agree that every [ORGANIZATION]n should earn equal pay for equal work. This legislation takes meaningful steps toward ensuring that every [ORGANIZATION]n, regardless of gender, receives fair compensation for their work. We have seen over the course of the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic that essential workers are the lifeblood of our society. We have seen women on the frontlines in the hospital, in the classroom, and at our essential retail stores, and it is time that all of these sheroes are compensated at the same rate as their male counterparts. Mr. [PERSON], I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter from [ORGANIZATION] urging passage of this legislation and highlighting the persistent wage gaps between genders. [ORGANIZATION][DATE]2, GPE[DATE], GPE86, [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]1. [ORGANIZATION], GPE[DATE], GPE86. [ORGANIZATION] On behalf of the more than 1.4 million members of [ORGANIZATION], I urge you to support fundamental fairness by combating wage discrimination on the basis of sex by passing [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. I urge you to vote yes on [ORGANIZATION]0 and to pass [ORGANIZATION] without any weakening amendments. [ORGANIZATION] would address the persistent wage gap based on sex by eliminating loopholes that hinder the effectiveness of the [PERSON] Act of [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION]0 would update and strengthen the [PERSON] Act in important ways. The bill closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work without any important business purpose related to the job. It would require employers to demonstrate that wage gaps are truly the result of factors other than gender. Importantly, it would prohibit retaliation against workers who share salary information or inquire about their employers wage practices. [ORGANIZATION]0 would also bring the remedies and procedures of the [PERSON] Act into conformance with those available for other civil rights claims. [ORGANIZATION] holds employers accountable for pay discrepancies between their male and female employees while strengthening incentives to prevent pay discrimination. And, it would preclude pay discrimination from following women from job to job. While some progress has been made since the passage of the [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act of [ORGANIZATION][DATE], the wage gap still persists, and disparities are evident at every educational level. GPE88ally, women still earn only 82 cents for every dollar earned by their male colleagues. For women of color, the wage gaps are even larger. Passage of [ORGANIZATION] will provide women and all other workers the tools necessary to challenge discrimination against them. It is an important step in making real progress in the [ORGANIZATION]ht to eliminate the gender wage gap and to provide economic, and retirement, security to women and their families. It is well past the time to end pay discrimination in the workplace. [ORGANIZATION][DATE]4 urges you to reject weakening amendments and to vote yes on final passage of [ORGANIZATION]. Sincerely, [PERSON]8, General President. Mrs. [PERSON]6. Mr. [PERSON], the gender gap is clear, and [ORGANIZATION] will address this disparity. Not only will this legislation help women in [PERSON]9, but it will help families across the GPE88. time 1DATE240 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. [PERSON], proponents of [ORGANIZATION]0 claim that despite current prohibitions against pay discrimination, female workers are still paid, on average, considerably less than male workers and, as a result, a pernicious wage gap exists. However, many studies demonstrate that the gap is not necessarily the product of workplace discrimination. In fact, this gap nearly disappears when factors such as [TIME] worked per week, rate of leaving the workforce, and industry and occupation are considered. A [ORGANIZATION]9 study by compensation software company [PERSON] found that when controlling for job title, DATE[DATE][DATE]s of experience, industry, location, and other compensable factors, women earned 98 percent as much as men. A [ORGANIZATION][DATE] study commissioned by [ORGANIZATION]8 found a gender wage gap of between 4.8 and [DATE].1 percent when controlling for economic variables between men and women. A DATE[DATE]4 [ORGANIZATION][DATE]6 study found that the gap in pay between female and male bus and train operators working for the [PERSON] Bay Transportation Authority, [ORGANIZATION], can be explained by the workplace choices that women and men make rather than other factors, such as discrimination. The study found that the earnings gap for [ORGANIZATION] bus and train operators is explained by the fact that the male operators took 48 percent fewer unpaid [TIME] off and worked 8[DATE] percent more overtime [TIME] per DATE[DATE][DATE] than the female operators. I want to point out that I am giving you facts here, Mr. [PERSON], facts. These differences are not due to any different work options faced by female and male operators. Rather, the study found that the female operators had a greater demand for workplace flexibility and a lower demand for overtime work [TIME] than the male operators. Pay discrimination is wrong and already illegal. We probably cannot say that enough. Any new legislation to combat pay discrimination should be based on facts, not supposition, not projection. The facts seem to be sorely missing from this debate. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentleman from GPE40 Mr. [PERSON]9, a distinguished member of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON]0. Mr. [PERSON], before I begin, I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter from the ORG62 Advocates in support of [ORGANIZATION]0. ORG62 Advocates, [PERSON]4, [ORGANIZATION]1. Re Pass [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 and vote no on harmful amendments. [ORGANIZATION] As the [ORGANIZATION] votes on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0, ORG62 Advocates strongly urges you to pass [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]0, without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. ORG62 Advocates [ORGANIZATION]61 is a national, non-profit legal organization based in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON][DATE], whose mission is to protect and expand economic and educational access and opportunities for women and girls. We have a long history of working [PERSON] H180[DATE] to address pay discrimination and to close the gender wage gap. We have litigated numerous cases relating to pay discrimination and regularly provide information and resources to employees who contact our free legal information hotline regarding unlawful gender and race-based pay disparities. We also advocate for various bills at the state-level to ensure economic and gender justice for women and families. Most recently, [ORGANIZATION]61 has co-sponsored [ORGANIZATION] 9[DATE][DATE] [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]9 which requires [PERSON][DATE] employers with 100 employees or more to submit an [ORGANIZATION] pay data report to [ORGANIZATION] outlining the compensation and [TIME] worked of its employees by gender, race, ethnicity, and job category. This allows state agencies to more efficiently identify patterns of wage disparities and encourages employers to analyze their own pay practices to ensure they are fair and lawful. Additionally, [ORGANIZATION]61 co-sponsored the [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act, [ORGANIZATION] [DATE][DATE], [LOCATION], DATE[DATE]6 which amended and strengthened our states [PERSON] Act to prohibit employer secrecy rules, clarify that workers must be paid equally to coworkers of another sex who perform substantially similar work, unless the employer proves that the disparity was due to a legitimate, job-related, bona fide factor not based on or derived from sex. We also cosponsored [ORGANIZATION] 168 [DATE] which prohibits [PERSON][DATE] employers from inquiring about prior salary and requires them to provide the pay [LOCATION] for a position in question upon reasonable request and [ORGANIZATION] 2282 Eggman, DATE[DATE]4 which clarified that prior salary cannot be used on its own, or in combination with a lawful factor, to justify a wage differential under the [PERSON][DATE] [PERSON] Act. Finally, [ORGANIZATION]61 also chairs [PERSON] DATE1[DATE], a national collaboration of organizations working at the local, regional, and federal level to close the gender wage gap. DATE1[DATE] in [PERSON], despite the passage of previous equal pay legislation, including the critically important [PERSON] [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act, the gender pay gap remains pervasive. Women, even those who work full-time and DATE[DATE][DATE] round, still only earn 80 cents to a mans dollar. This gives rise to a nationwide pay gap of 900 billion every DATE[DATE][DATE]. For women of color, the pay gap is even larger. For every dollar earned by a non-Hispanic white man, [ORGANIZATION] women earn only [DATE][DATE] cents, Native [ORGANIZATION]n women only [DATE] cents, and [PERSON]4 women only 61 cents. These large pay gaps, although of varying sizes across demographics of women, prove harmful to the economic security of women and families across the country. The negative economic consequences of these gender pay gaps are especially pronounced as mothers are primary or sole breadwinners in half of [PERSON] households with children. Of these female-headed households, [DATE] of them fall below the poverty line. As it stands, the gender and race pay gaps are closing at a glacial pace. At current rates, the gender wage gap will not close until DATE[DATE]. For women of color, the picture is even bleaker. It will not be until DATE[DATE]9 that [PERSON]4 women receive equal pay to white men and not until [ORGANIZATION]0 that [PERSON] receive the same. [PERSON] is the time for action. [ORGANIZATION] is an important step in accelerating the closing of the gender pay gap. Among many provisions, [ORGANIZATION] would bar retaliation for discussing or disclosing wages. According to [ORGANIZATION], across the country, about half of workers were prohibited or strongly discouraged from disclosing their wages to other employees. Yet, when an individual is unable to discuss wages with other employees, it becomes exceedingly difficult to determine if one is making less than ones colleagues. By ending the practice of pay secrecy, [ORGANIZATION] would make it harder for employers to keep pervasive practices of pay discrimination hidden. In addition, [ORGANIZATION] would also prohibit employers from relying on salary history when setting the wages of their employees. This provision is critical as the practice of relying on prior salary can lead to a single act of pay discrimination following a woman throughout her career. One DATE[DATE][DATE] out of college, women are already earning [DATE] percent less than their male colleagues, even after controlling for factors such as college major, occupation, or [TIME] worked. If a womans prior salary is used by future employers, the gender pay gap will continue to persist as a depressed past salary continues to be used to determine future wages. Prohibiting employer reliance on salary history will help stop the perpetuation of unequal pay. Another crucial provision in this version of [ORGANIZATION] is the commitment to pay data collection. As mentioned above, [ORGANIZATION]61 fought for pay data collection at the [PERSON][DATE] state-level and secured this via [ORGANIZATION] 9[DATE][DATE] [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]9. The need to ensure equal pay is now more apparent than ever during the current [ORGANIZATION] health and economic crisis, which has exposed the lasting harm of unequal pay and other contributors to economic security on women, and in particular, women of color. Pay data collection helps uncover pay discrimination, which is a major contributor to the overall gender and race-based wage gaps. Recognizing that pay discrimination is difficult to detect and address, the [PERSON]0 ORG22 announced a proposed revision to [ORGANIZATION] to include the reporting of pay data by gender, race and ethnicity beginning in DATE[DATE]4. For more than [DATE]0 DATE[DATE][DATE]s, large companies have been submitting these [ORGANIZATION] reports with demographic information to [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE]. This data has helped the agency to identify patterns of occupational segregation and discrimination and enforce federal equal pay and anti- discrimination law. However, the [ORGANIZATION] ORG22 put a halt to the implementation of this new rule, dealing a significant blow to the [ORGANIZATION]ht for equal pay. [ORGANIZATION] would also close loopholes that allow employers to pay women less without a legitimate business justification and would provide the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination as race and ethnicity based discrimination. It would also require wage data collection and support salary negotiation skills training programs to give women the tools to advocate for higher wages. [PERSON] negotiation workshops have been shown to be highly effective. For example, in a study conducted following the free salary negotiation workshops put on by the city of GPE80, [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] at the University of [PERSON] GPE80 found that nearly half of the women who were interviewed had either successfully negotiated a pay raise or starting salary that brought them either to or above the market rate following the training. As the bill states, these continuing pay disparities have devastating impacts on women, especially women of color. Over the course of the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic, researchers have found this to be even more true. Since [ORGANIZATION][DATE], 2.4 million women have exited the workforce, or, been pushed out of the workforce, highlighting a dramatic regress for gender equity. More and more women are forced to stay home in order to care for children and loved ones while men continue to work. Before the pandemic, women did, on average, three times more unpaid care work than men, and this responsibility has heightened since the pandemic given school and childcare closures, and increased care needs for elderly relatives. Women who are able to remain in the workforce, however, are still paid less than their male colleagues, especially [PERSON]4 women and women of color. [ORGANIZATION] has exacerbated these long-standing gender and racial inequities. [PERSON], more than ever, elected officials must recognize these disparate impacts and deliver solutions to [ORGANIZATION]n women. Without continued efforts to provide women with the tools to challenge and unearth pay discrimination and provisions to keep employers from perpetuating persistent inequalities, the gender pay gap will not close. [ORGANIZATION] is an important step on the path towards a future where women can stand on equal economic footing to their male counterparts. For these reasons, we are proud to support [ORGANIZATION] and urge you to pass [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]1, Senior Counsel, [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON]0. Mr. [PERSON], it should offend every one of us that there remains a pay gap between men and women for the same work. Women of color, in particular--African-[ORGANIZATION]n women, [ORGANIZATION] women, Native [ORGANIZATION]n women, [LOCATION] women--are making as low as [DATE]2 cents, Mr. [PERSON], for every dollar for the same job and work by a man. This is a travesty. Lets make our communities stronger. Lets make our economy stronger. In [LOCATION], East [LOCATION], northern GPE81, and the northwest [PERSON], women of color are the majority of workers. I cant go back home to my district and say that somehow they are working the same as men, or maybe more, in many cases, and are making less. I support [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION], because we need to bring fairness into the discussion. Lets make our communities stronger. Lets make our economy stronger. [ORGANIZATION]-based pay discrimination should not be something we are still discussing now in [ORGANIZATION]1. [ORGANIZATION] will put everyone on the line to make sure that we are all doing our best to ensure fair and equitable pay. Closing the pay gap will make women and families financially stronger. Mr. [PERSON], lets make our communities stronger. Lets make our economy stronger. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [PERSON][DATE] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]2, the co-chair of [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON][DATE]. Mr. [PERSON], I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter titled Support [ORGANIZATION] written by [ORGANIZATION][DATE]. [ORGANIZATION][DATE], [PERSON]4, [ORGANIZATION]1. Support [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]0--Vote No on Harmful Amendments [ORGANIZATION] On behalf of [ORGANIZATION][DATE]1, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 220 organizations to promote and protect the rights of all persons in [PERSON], we urge you to vote for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]0, without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. [ORGANIZATION] is a priority of [LOCATION], and we will include your vote on final passage in our Voting [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 for the 11[DATE]th ORG2. [ORGANIZATION]-based pay discrimination compromises the economic security of millions of women in [PERSON]--and for women of color, the harm is exacerbated by their experience of both race- and gender-based wage disparities. Women working full-time, DATE16 in [PERSON] are typically paid about 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, adding up to a loss of more than 400,000 over DATE[DATE]. [PERSON]4 women are typically paid only [DATE] cents for every dollar paid to non-Hispanic white men, while Native [ORGANIZATION]n women are paid only 60 cents, [PERSON] are paid just [DATE][DATE] cents, and women in certain Asian [ORGANIZATION]n and [LOCATION] communities are paid as little as [DATE]2 cents. Research shows that the gender pay gap occurs across almost all occupations and industries, develops very early in womens careers, and grows over time. Action to close the wage gap is long overdue, but in light of the current economic crisis, it is even more critical that ORG2 act now to strengthen protections against pay discrimination, both as a matter of economic security and fundamental fairness. The loss of income and savings from the wage gap has exacerbated the harmful effects of the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic for women of color and their families. [PERSON]4 and [PERSON][DATE] women have been overrepresented in frontline jobs during the pandemic--many in low-paid jobs at high risk of exposure to [ORGANIZATION] and without benefits like paid leave and employer-sponsored health insurance--but they are paid less than non-Hispanic white men in the same jobs. Already struggling to make ends meet, women of color in low-pay jobs must also endure pay discrimination that artificially reduces their overall earnings, making it even less likely for women of color to amass the financial resources to withstand a health emergency and putting entire families at risk of economic insecurity. Almost [DATE][DATE] percent of [PERSON]4 mothers and more than 4[DATE] percent of [ORGANIZATION] mothers were breadwinners in their families in DATE[DATE]4. At the same time, [PERSON]4 and [PERSON][DATE] women have faced staggering job losses during the pandemic. The unemployment rate for [PERSON]4 women reached 1[DATE].4 percent in May [ORGANIZATION]9, for example, and [PERSON] experienced the highest unemployment rate of any group during the pandemic, at more than 20 percent in [DATE]. The unemployment rate for [PERSON]4 women and [PERSON] remains exceptionally high. [ORGANIZATION] would update and strengthen the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] to provide more effective protection against sex-based pay discrimination. [ORGANIZATION] would Prohibit retaliation against workers who discuss or disclose wages Prevent employers from relying on salary history to determine future pay so that pay discrimination does not extend from job to job Close loopholes in the [PERSON] Act that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work without any business necessity related to the job Ensure that women can obtain the same remedies for sex- based pay discrimination as those available to people subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity Provide for much-needed training and technical assistance and require wage data collection. Women and their families can no longer be shortchanged. Given the importance of this bill, we urge representatives to pass [ORGANIZATION]0 without amendments that limit the bills scope or undermine its protections. Sincerely, [PERSON]4, Interim President and CEO. [PERSON][DATE], Executive Vice President for [ORGANIZATION][DATE][DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON][DATE]. Mr. [PERSON], for [ORGANIZATION]6, [PERSON]woman [PERSON] has been trying to get this bill passed. She is sick and tired, I am sick and tired, and [ORGANIZATION]n women are sick and tired of being treated like second-class citizens. Imagine if the women here in ORG2 were being paid 60, [DATE], or 80 percent of what our male colleagues are making. Do you think we would put up with it? Of course not. Somehow, [ORGANIZATION]n women are expected to put up with that. Do you want facts? Ask about [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]6, from the [ORGANIZATION] of [PERSON]1, who was paid less than her colleague because they decided that they would base her salary on what she was making before, as opposed to the job at hand. We have a problem, Mr. [PERSON]. This has been going on for [STREET] too long. It is time for us to fix it for all the women and children in this country who want to be paid equally for equal work so that they have money for childcare, rent, food, and education. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from the [PERSON]6 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON][DATE], the previous head of the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]8. Mr. [PERSON], I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter from [ORGANIZATION] supporting passage of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]n [ORGANIZATION], [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]1. Re [ORGANIZATION][DATE]6 Urges Passage of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] On behalf of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION][DATE]6, the largest voluntary association of lawyers and legal professionals in the world. I am writing to urge you to vote for passage of [ORGANIZATION], which would update the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] enacted by ORG2 almost DATE2[DATE] to prohibit gender-based pay inequality. This legislation, which is expected to come to the floor [ORGANIZATION]8, has the support of working men and women across the country who want this nation to live up to its expressed commitment to equal pay for equal work. The [PERSON] Act of [DATE] prohibits an employer from paying unequal wages to male and female workers who perform jobs under similar work conditions that require substantially equal skill, effort, and responsibility unless there is a legitimate reason for a pay differential. [ORGANIZATION] does not alter the basic scheme of this statute or impose unreasonable burdens on employers indeed, the majority of its proposed changes are borrowed from other civil rights statutes that have proved more effective in eradicating workplace discrimination. We would like to respond to some persistent misperceptions regarding this important legislation Enactment of this bill will not compel businesses to pay their female workforce substantially more money to eliminate the existing wage gap. The purpose of this bill is to update the [PERSON] Act, which only applies in situations where women or men are receiving unequal pay for equal work. It does not create a new mandate. Employers already have a legal obligation to pay men and women equal wages for equal work unless there is a legitimate reason for the differential. Enactment of this bill will not interject the government into the pay decisions of businesses. [ORGANIZATION] does not tell employers what factors to use to set pay it only requires that pay decisions are job- and business- related. Enactment of this bill will not make employers liable for any and every wage differential. An employer will still have four affirmative defenses and will not be guilty of wage discrimination if a pay differential is based on i seniority, ii merit, iii a system that measures quantity or quality of production, or iv a factor other than sex. 29 [ORGANIZATION] 206dl. The only difference is that Paycheck Fairness Act will resolve uncertainty in the law over how to apply the fourth defense by redefining it as a bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training, or experience. Enactment of a provision to clarify the factor other than sex defense will not eviscerate legitimate use of the defense. It is intended to prevent employers from asserting that unequal pay was the result of market force-derived excuses such as prior salaries or negotiation outcomes. A bona fide factor other than sex must be job-related, consistent with business necessity, and account for the entire differential in compensation at issue. The only time this defense would not apply would be in situations where an alternative employment practice is available that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential and the employer has refused to adopt it. Enactment of this bill will not encourage more lawsuits and jeopardize post-pandemic economic recovery. The bill is designed resolve uncertainties in the law and increase employer compliance with the [PERSON] Act, not to encourage more lawsuits. The bills strengthened remedies, which align with those available in other employment discrimination statutes, will encourage employers to review their wage-setting practices and rectify those that are based on invalid justifications. Men and women who are paid fairly have no incentive to jeopardize their jobs and subject themselves to costly, time- consuming, and emotionally taxing lawsuits brought against their employers. The bills clarification of the factor other than sex defense will not spawn new litigation. Instead, it will provide guidance to the courts and resolve uncertainty in the law. The standard, which is adapted from Title VII discrimination cases and codified in the Civil Rights Act of [ORGANIZATION]9, is one with which courts already are familiar. The bill will help strengthen the economy by improving the present and future economic welfare of working women, who comprise about one-half of the workforce and are the primary breadwinner in more than 12 million [ORGANIZATION]n families. We urge you to demonstrate your commitment to equal pay for equal work by voting for [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you for your consideration of our views. Sincerely, [PERSON]9. [PERSON] H1809 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]8. Mr. [PERSON], I am pleased to strongly support [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION], a critically important bill. As the first woman to chair [ORGANIZATION], I enforced the [PERSON] Act. I particularly appreciate that [ORGANIZATION]0 would bring long-awaited strength to the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]9. I especially appreciate that ORG2woman Rosa [PERSON], a great champion for equal pay, has included my Pay Equity for All Act in [ORGANIZATION]0, where I will focus DATE1[DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] would prohibit employers from asking job applicants their salary history. Even though many employers may not intentionally discriminate against applicants or employees based on gender, race, or ethnicity, setting wages based on salary history is routinely done in the workplace and can reinforce the wage gap. Evidence clearly shows that members of historically disadvantaged groups often start their careers with unfair and artificially low wages compared to their [ORGANIZATION] male counterparts, and these disparities are compounded from job to job. Job and salary offers should be based on an applicants skill and merit, not on salary history. This bill addresses this problem by assessing penalties against employers who ask applicants for their salary history during the interview process. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]0 requires that the employer defense must be consistent with business necessity, a broad and ill-defined term. We dont know how the courts will interpret this sweeping requirement, but we do know the dictionary says it means absolutely essential or indispensable. How can an employer prove that any one factor determining employee pay could rise to the level to be necessary for the survival of the business? Proponents of [ORGANIZATION]0 will argue this phrase has been adopted from title VII, as amended by the [ORGANIZATION]9 Civil Rights Act, but the phrase has spawned endless litigation because of its lack of clarity. Anyone who thinks this concept is simple and can just be carried over from title VII is either naive or has been misled. Further, the dubious concept of business necessity was developed under controversial so-called disparate impact analysis and cannot simply be slapped onto the [PERSON] Act, especially where, as mandated by [ORGANIZATION]0, damages are unlimited. In contrast, under title VII, in disparate impact cases, damages are limited to backpay and benefits. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentleman from [PERSON]1 Mr. [PERSON]0. Mr. [PERSON]1 of [PERSON]1. Mr. [PERSON], this bill is really about mothers and daughters who earn about 82 cents on the dollar for every dollar a man earns. It is about mothers and daughters who lose about 1 trillion a DATE[DATE][DATE] because of the wage gap. For those men who dont have a really good reason to vote for it, it is about the fact that a woman gave birth to every man alive. So for all of the suffering, we ought to vote for this bill, because we are here as a result of some woman suffering for us. At this time, I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter from the ORG90. ORG90, [PERSON]4, [ORGANIZATION]1. Re Pass [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 and vote no on harmful amendments. [ORGANIZATION] As the [ORGANIZATION] votes on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0, the ORG90 [ORGANIZATION] strongly urges you to pass [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]0, without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. ORG2[DATE] [ORGANIZATION], founded in [ORGANIZATION]1, is a coalition of womens and civil rights organizations labor unions religious, professional, and educational associations, commissions on women, state and local pay equity coalitions and individuals working to eliminate sex- and race-based wage discrimination and to achieve pay equity. These pay gaps can be addressed only if workers have the legal tools necessary to challenge discrimination and employers are provided with effective incentives and technical assistance to comply with the law. [ORGANIZATION] is one of these urgently required tools. Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender pay gaps persist, and earnings lost to these gaps are exacerbating the financial effects of [ORGANIZATION], falling particularly heavily on women of color and the families who depend on their income. [ORGANIZATION], which has been passed three previous times by the [ORGANIZATION], mostly recently in the 116th ORG2, offers a much-needed update to the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] by providing new tools to battle pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination. Women are increasingly the primary or co-breadwinner in their families and cannot afford to be shortchanged any longer. Women working full-time, DATE16 are typically paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, adding up to a loss of more than 400,000 over DATE[DATE]. This wage gap varies by race and is larger for many women of color [PERSON]4 women working full time, DATE[DATE][DATE] round typically make only [DATE] cents, Native [ORGANIZATION]n women only 60 cents, and [PERSON] only [DATE][DATE] cents, for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts. [PERSON] lose more than 1 million over a 40-DATE[DATE][DATE] career due to the wage gap. While Asian [ORGANIZATION]n and [LOCATION] [LOCATION] women make 8[DATE] cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, many [LOCATION] communities experience drastically wider pay gaps. And even when controlling for factors, such as education and experience, pay gaps persist and start early in womens careers and contribute to a wealth gap that follows them throughout their work lives and into retirement. Persistent pay discrimination, often cloaked by employer-imposed pay secrecy policies, is one factor driving these wage gaps. [ORGANIZATION] updates and strengthens the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] to ensure that it provides robust protection against sex-based pay discrimination. Among other provisions, this comprehensive bill ends secrecy around pay by barring retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages, and requiring employers to report pay data to the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] prohibits employers from relying on salary history in determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not follow women from job to job closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work without any important business justification related to the job ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex- based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity provides much needed training and technical assistance, as well as data collection and research The [ORGANIZATION] pandemic and systemic racism have exposed how the work performed primarily by women, and particularly [PERSON]4 and brown women, has long been and continues to be undervalued and underpaid, even as the rest of the country is newly recognizing the essential nature of this work. We cannot build back an economy that works for everyone without ensuring that all women can work with equality, safety, and dignity, starting with pay equity. Passing [ORGANIZATION] would mark a vitally important step toward ensuring this becomes reality. We urge you to pass [ORGANIZATION] without harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections. Sincerely, [PERSON]2, [ORGANIZATION]retary-Treasurer, ORG90. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION]2 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON][DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]4. Mr. [PERSON], this DATE[DATE][DATE] marks the [DATE]th anniversary of the [PERSON] Act. Despite the goal to ensure equality for women in the workplace, DATE22 later, the pay gap still exists. Women DATE1[DATE], on average, make 82 cents for every dollar earned by a man. For women of color, the disparity is worse, with [PERSON]4 women making [DATE] cents on the dollar, [LOCATION] women making 60 cents, and [PERSON] making [DATE][DATE] cents. This disparity is unacceptable, and it is unfair. Let us come together right now to pass [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. When women get equal pay, our families and our entire economy will do better. I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter from [ORGANIZATION]8[DATE] in favor of [ORGANIZATION]0. [ORGANIZATION]84 [ORGANIZATION] We are writing to ask for your support in passage of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0, and to ensure that passage in the [ORGANIZATION] is done without amendments that diminish the protections provided by the bill. There is ample evidence to show that despite equal pay laws, the gender pay gap exists. These lost earnings add up to a loss of over 400,000 in DATE[DATE]. The wage gap is even more significant for women of color [PERSON] H1810 with [PERSON]4 women working full time making only [DATE] cents for every dollar paid to men, Native [ORGANIZATION]n women only 60 cents, and [PERSON] only [DATE][DATE] cents, for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts. As people of faith, we believe that each person deserves to be treated with dignity and humanity. When women are paid less for the same work that is a concrete and explicit [STREET] of showing that their work and personhood are valued less. Passage of [ORGANIZATION] will strengthen and update the [PERSON] Act and provide women with the legal means to [ORGANIZATION]ht the gender pay gap and challenge gender pay discrimination. The work done by women, and particularly [PERSON]4 and brown women, is undervalued and underpaid. Even though much of that labor is what keeps people fed, clothed, and cared for. The work of women, so important to how a society functions is always relegated to less pay and less value. This is a gross injustice--and part of the systemic racist structures that undergird the economic system in [PERSON]. [PERSON]0s vision for our world is one where all are valued, no matter their gender, race, or credo. We urge you to pass [ORGANIZATION] without harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections. [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentleman from [PERSON]9 Mr. [PERSON][DATE]. Mr. [PERSON]6. Mr. [PERSON], we all agree that every [ORGANIZATION]n should be compensated for the quality of their work and not face discrimination in the workplace based on race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. That is why ORG2 passed the [PERSON] Act in [DATE] and broader nondiscrimination laws under title VII of the Civil Rights Act the following DATE[DATE][DATE]. However, unlike those bills, [ORGANIZATION]0 offers no new protections. It is simply a messaging bill to score political points. What will the bill actually do? For job creators, they can expect more lawsuits and more regulatory burdens. While limiting legal options for women by changing [ORGANIZATION][DATE]9 class action lawsuits from an opt-in system to a mandatory opt-out system, [ORGANIZATION]0 allows trial lawyers to pursue unlimited compensatory damages, making it nearly impossible for employers to defend against frivolous lawsuits. Additionally, it requires employers to make intrusive data disclosures to [PERSON] regarding the sex, race, and national origin of employees and, for the first time, the hiring, termination, and promotion data of those employees, ultimately posing a threat to workers privacy. The compliance costs to satisfy these requirements can total more than 600 million a DATE[DATE][DATE]. We have already seen a number of small businesses forced to close this DATE[DATE][DATE] because of [PERSON] lockdowns, and now my Democratic colleagues want to impose more regulatory burdens on businesses that were lucky enough to survive. Thankfully, my colleague from GPE40, ORG2woman [PERSON] [PERSON]4, has a solution that will actually address pay discrimination and support women in the workplace. The Wage Equity Act protects workers privacy by encouraging voluntary pay analysis while bolstering womens employment through the creation of a grant program for women in college or career and technical programs to provide negotiation skills education. I urge my colleagues to oppose [ORGANIZATION]0 and work with Republicans on meaningful legislation to ensure all workers have the opportunity and wages they deserve. time [DATE] Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], could you advise us how much time is available on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] has [TIME] remaining. The gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION] has 111[TIME] remaining. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from GPE44 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]8, the chair of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]9. Mr. [PERSON], I rise in strong support of [ORGANIZATION]. The [PERSON] Act has been the law for [ORGANIZATION]6, but, in [ORGANIZATION]1, equal pay for equal work is still not a reality for many women, especially women of color. This is an injustice to millions of working families. Closing the wage gap is an economic imperative. DATE2[DATE], I was honored to chair the hearing on persistent gender- based wage discrimination. We heard witnesses describe the barriers to detecting wage discrimination and holding employers accountable. Most importantly, we heard how [ORGANIZATION] can address the problematic loopholes in the current law, empower workers to better detect and combat wage discrimination, and create mechanisms for better pay data transparency. By advancing [ORGANIZATION], we can restore the original intent of the [PERSON] Act and finally make equal pay for equal work a reality. I thank ORG2woman [PERSON] for her steadfast leadership. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. [PERSON], I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter in support of [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION]. [LOCATION]0, [PERSON]4, [ORGANIZATION]1. [ORGANIZATION] On behalf of the more than 1[DATE],000 members and supporters of [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]0, I urge you to vote in support of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 and to oppose harmful amendments when the bill comes to the [ORGANIZATION] floor [ORGANIZATION]8. Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender pay gaps persist. [ORGANIZATION] offers a much needed update to the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] by providing new tools to battle these pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination. The dual crises of a global pandemic and systemic racism have laid bare the economic disparities in our country. While we all struggle to survive, we are relying heavily on the work performed by essential workers who are disproportionately [PERSON]4 and brown women. Yet their work has long been and continues to be undervalued and underpaid. At the same time, in [ORGANIZATION]9, [ORGANIZATION]n women lost more than [DATE] million jobs. Women accounted for 100 of the jobs lost last DATE20--all [DATE]0,000 of them--and women of color made up an overwhelming share of those jobs. This massive job loss coupled with the consistent undervaluing of womens work compounds over time and results in significant lost earnings. As a result, women do not have a financial cushion to help weather the current economic crisis or the ability to build wealth, all of which contribute to racial and gender wealth gaps that create barriers to families economic prosperity. We cannot build back our economy without immediately addressing these realities. And women and their families cannot afford to wait any longer for change. To appropriately respond to the crises we are currently experiencing we must make real, concrete progress in ensuring all women receive fair pay. While the gap has narrowed since passage of the [PERSON] Act of [DATE], progress has largely stalled in recent DATE[DATE][DATE]s. Data from the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] once again revealed that women working full-time, DATE16 are typically paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. The pay gaps are even wider for women of color. [PERSON]4 women and [PERSON] make, respectively, [DATE] and [DATE][DATE] cents on the dollar as compared to non-Hispanic, white men. Action is required now at the current rate, the overall pay gap between mens and womens earnings will not close until [ORGANIZATION]9 and it will take significantly longer for women of color to reach parity. Research indicates that the gender pay gap develops very early in womens careers. Controlling for factors known to affect earnings, such as education and training, marital status, and [TIME] worked, research finds that college- educated women still earn [DATE] percent less than men just [ORGANIZATION] out of college. Over time, the gap compounds and widens, impacting womens social security and retirement. Ensuring that women have equal pay would have a dramatic impact on families and the economy. According to a report from [ORGANIZATION] IWPR, the poverty rate for all working women would be cut in half, falling from 8.0 percent to [DATE].8 percent if women were paid the same as comparable men. The same study indicates that the [PERSON] economy would have produced an additional [DATE]12.6 billion in income if women had received equal pay for equal work. This is why I urge you to pass this important bill. [ORGANIZATION] would update and strengthen the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] to ensure that it provides effective protection against sex-based pay discrimination in [ORGANIZATION] workplace. The bill takes several important steps, including [ORGANIZATION] The bill prohibits retaliation against workers for discussing or disclosing wages. Without the non-retaliation provisions of [ORGANIZATION], many women will continue to be silenced in the workplace--that is, prohibited from talking about wages with coworkers without the fear of being fired. This is an issue that keeps women--like it kept [PERSON][DATE]--from learning of the pay discrimination against them. [PERSON] on Prior [PERSON] History The bill prohibits employers from relying on salary history in determining future pay, so that prior discrimination doesnt follow workers from job to job. [PERSON] H1811 Requiring Job-Relatedness The bill closes loopholes that allow employers to pay women less than men for the same work without a business necessity that is related to the job. Equalizing Remedies The bill ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity. Providing [PERSON] and Resources The bill also provides technical assistance to businesses, requires wage data collection, and supports salary negotiation skills training programs to give women the tools to advocate for higher wages. The pay gap is persistent and can only be addressed if women are armed with the tools necessary to challenge discrimination against them, and employers are provided with effective incentives and technical assistance to comply with the law. I urge you to take a critical step towards pay equity by voting in support of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 and opposing harmful amendments when the bill comes to the [ORGANIZATION] floor [ORGANIZATION]8. Cosponsorship and votes associated with this bill may be scored in the [LOCATION]0 Action Fund ORG2ional Voting [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 for the 11[DATE]th ORG2. Sincerely, [PERSON]6, Senior Director of Public Policy, [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield myself such time as I may consume. Another provision in [ORGANIZATION]0 requires that, in addition to proving business necessity, an employer must prove the business necessity accounts for 100 percent of the differential in compensation at issue. This is impossible to do. How can an employer explain slight differences in compensation based on educational level, experience, or quality of work on the job? This bill is going to make it impossible for employers to pay differentially on merit for anything. It is a bad bill, and we should not be passing it. I urge my colleagues to vote no. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentleman from GPE4[DATE] Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON]1. Mr. [PERSON], this GPE88 has made far too little progress in the [ORGANIZATION]ht for equal pay in the workplace. In [ORGANIZATION]1, women who work full time DATE[DATE][DATE] round are paid, on average, only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. This adds up to over 400,000 in lost wages over the course of a womans career. For women of color, the gender gap is a gender chasm, with [PERSON] earning [DATE][DATE] cents, [PERSON]4 women earning [DATE] cents, and Asian [ORGANIZATION]n and [LOCATION] women earning a mere [DATE]2 cents for every dollar paid to a [ORGANIZATION] man for the same work. The long overdue Paycheck Fairness Act would bring us closer to closing these gaps by ensuring equal pay for equal work. Notably, it would hold employers accountable for discriminatory practices, end pay secrecy, ease workers ability to challenge pay discrimination, and strengthen the available remedies for wronged employees. I thank ORG2woman [PERSON] for her tireless advocacy on this issue. Mr. [PERSON], I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter of support from [PERSON]6. GPE88al [ORGANIZATION]01, [PERSON]4, [ORGANIZATION]1. Re Pass [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 and vote no on harmful amendments. [ORGANIZATION] As the [ORGANIZATION] votes [ORGANIZATION]8 on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0, we strongly urge you to pass [ORGANIZATION] without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender pay gaps persist, and earnings lost to these gaps are exacerbating the financial effects of [ORGANIZATION], falling particularly heavily on women of color and the families who depend on their income.

Sincerely, [PERSON]2, Vice President for [ORGANIZATION]91. [PERSON], Director of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON]1. Mr. [PERSON], I urge my [ORGANIZATION] colleagues to vote for this package and close the gender wage gap once and for all. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [PERSON][DATE] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON][DATE] of [PERSON][DATE]. Mr. [PERSON], I thank [PERSON]woman [PERSON] for her persistent leadership for so many DATE[DATE][DATE]s, as well as [PERSON]man [PERSON] and the [PERSON]. We must put an end to the wage gap and pay discrimination. Let me tell you, as you have heard, the wage gap for women of color is so much worse. I am reminded DATE1[DATE] of our heroine, [PERSON]6. She said, I am sick and tired of being sick and tired. [PERSON]4 women earn [DATE] cents, indigenous women earn 60 cents, [PERSON] earn [DATE][DATE] cents, [ORGANIZATION] women earn 82 cents, and [LOCATION] women are paid as little as [DATE]2 cents on every dollar paid to the [ORGANIZATION] man. That is outrageous. Mr. [PERSON], I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter from the [PERSON] DATE1[DATE]! campaign urging Members to support the bill. [PERSON] DATE1[DATE], [PERSON]4, [ORGANIZATION]1. Re Pass [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 and vote no on harmful amendments. [ORGANIZATION]s As the [ORGANIZATION] votes on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0, we strongly urge you to pass [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]0, without amendments that would limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. As members of the [PERSON] DATE1[DATE] Campaign, we represent a broad coalition consisting of both national and state based organizations from all across the country, that are dedicated to challenging the legal, policy, and cultural barriers at the local, state, and national level that keep women from being paid equally. Launched on the [DATE]0th anniversary of the signing of the federal [PERSON] Act, we are committed to [ORGANIZATION]hting and advocating for legislation that will ultimately close the gender wage gap. With our nation now entering into DATE[DATE][DATE] two of this global pandemic, we can no longer ignore the disparities that have existed long before our nations shutdown, and [PERSON] H1812 despite federal and state equal pay laws, the gender pay gap persists, and earnings lost to these gaps are widened due to the financial impacts of the pandemic, with a heavier burden bared by women of color and the families and communities who depend on them and their income. Women are increasingly becoming the primary or co- breadwinner in their families, with [PERSON]4 mothers being far more likely than other mothers to be the primary or sole breadwinners for their families and more than half of [ORGANIZATION] mothers being the breadwinner in families with children [DATE]. Women across this country, working full-time, DATE16, are typically being paid only .82 cents for every dollar paid out to men, adding up to a loss of more than 400,000 dollars over DATE[DATE]. And the wage gap gets even wider as race is factored in. [PERSON]4 women working full time, DATE[DATE][DATE] round typically make only .[DATE] cents, Native [ORGANIZATION]n women only .60 cents, and [PERSON] only .[DATE][DATE] cents, for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts. [PERSON] stand to lose more than 1 million over a 40-DATE[DATE][DATE] career due to the wage gap, and while Asian [ORGANIZATION]n and [LOCATION] [LOCATION] women make .8[DATE] cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, many [LOCATION] communities experience drastically wider pay gaps. And even when controlling for factors, such as education and experience, the pay gaps still persist, start early in womens careers and contribute to a wealth gap that follows them throughout their lifetimes. These pay gaps can be addressed and rectified through legislation that offers workers the legal tools and safeguards needed to challenge discrimination. [ORGANIZATION], which has already been passed by the [ORGANIZATION] three times before and most recently by the 116th ORG2, would offer the much needed updates to the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] by making these tools available while also providing new ones, that would help to combat and challenge discrimination and the pay gap. [ORGANIZATION] updates and strengthens the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] to ensure that it provides robust protection against sex-based pay discrimination. Among other provisions, this comprehensive bill ends secrecy around pay by barring retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages, and requiring employers to report pay data to the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] prohibits employers from relying on salary history in determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not follow women from job to job closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work without any important business justification related to the job ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex- based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity provides much needed training and technical assistance, as well as data collection and research This past DATE[DATE][DATE] has undoubtedly been a challenging one. The pandemic has shone a light on how the work performed by women, specifically [PERSON]4 and brown women, has continuously been undervalued, underpaid, and gone unnoticed. We cannot continue to use the word essential to describe the nature of this work, if there is no commitment to ensuring that all women can work with safety and with dignity, and the first step to making this happen, starts with pay equity, and the catalyst for this would be the passing of [ORGANIZATION]. We urge you to pass [ORGANIZATION] without harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, [PERSON] DATE1[DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON][DATE] of [PERSON][DATE]. Mr. [PERSON], let me finally say Remember, because of this discrimination, womens ORG28 benefits during their senior DATE[DATE][DATE]s are much lower than men. This injustice follows women throughout their lives. This issue impacts women, regardless of industry, education level or political party. It is past time--it is so past time for ORG2 to take action on this. Mr. [PERSON], I urge my colleagues to vote yes. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]0 would create impossible conditions in which to operate for businessowners large and small. It would result in endless litigation in front of judges and juries, who will delve into employer compensation decisions even when there has been a showing that those decisions are not based on sex. Alternatively, businessowners will simply decide not to risk liability of unlimited damages, which could bankrupt them, and the end result will be the use of pay bands by employers, which imposes a government civil service model on the private sector that will result in everyone in the workplace being compensated equally without regard to merit. This is a very broad goal of liberals in general Pay everybody the same and stifle innovation, stifle initiative, stifle anybody being different. This is the wrong thing for our country. That is not the [STREET] [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] operates. We value innovation, we value entrepreneurism, we value independent thinking. We dont want to crush everybody into thinking the same [STREET]. That is the [STREET] civil service works. That is the [STREET] the unions work. That is not the [STREET] it should be in private industry, which has made this country great. This bill stalls upward mobility. It hurts all employees striving to succeed on the job, who want to be rewarded for their efforts. For these reasons and others, [ORGANIZATION]0s provisions are unworkable and will benefit only trial lawyers, not innovative, hardworking workers. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [PERSON][DATE] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], the distinguished [PERSON] of [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor of the [ORGANIZATION]. This is about building back better with women, not stifling innovation and entrepreneurship, but reaping the benefits of all that women have to offer in our country. Mr. [PERSON], DATE22 ago, President John F. [PERSON] signed the [PERSON] Act into law, lauding it as a measure that adds to our laws another structure basic to democracy. DATE1[DATE], I rise in support of a similarly momentous measure for our democracy, [ORGANIZATION], which will strengthen that law and reaffirm this pledge equal work deserves equal pay. We all salute [PERSON]woman Rosa [PERSON], the guardian angel of this legislation, and so much of what Democrats work on behalf of women and families. [PERSON]woman [PERSON] is relentless, introducing this bill in each of [DATE] and securing bipartisan support and the support of the entire [ORGANIZATION]. And now, because of her leadership, we have a chance for it to become law. Many of us, with [PERSON] [PERSON] at the helm, have helped lead the charge for equal pay for many DATE[DATE][DATE]s now. [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] Democrats passed the [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act to protect womens right to challenge unfair pay in the courts. We are proud that President [PERSON]0 made this bill the first bill he signed into law. You talked about it earlier, Mr. [PERSON]man. Exactly [DATE], when Democrats retook the majority, we were honored to stand with [PERSON][DATE], that courageous woman, as we took another step forward for pay equity by again introducing ORG2woman [PERSON]s bill, [ORGANIZATION]. DATE1[DATE], a Democratic ORG2 led by over 120 women in the [ORGANIZATION] with an administration led by President [PERSON], a longtime champion of women and the first woman Vice President, [PERSON]2 and with a record number of women in the [ORGANIZATION]9[DATE], those are great advances for women. We will pass this landmark bill once more, send it to the [ORGANIZATION], and then, hopefully, to President [PERSON] to sign into law. I am the mother of four daughters. I dont know anybody who has a daughter, a wife, a sister, a mother who can say to them, You are not worth it your time is not worth the time of your brother, your father, your whoever else. What father, brother or son would not want the women in their lives to have equal pay? Sadly, equal pay is not yet a reality in [ORGANIZATION]. Nearly six [ORGANIZATION]8 after the passage of the [PERSON] Act, women working full time DATE[DATE][DATE] round are paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. And for women of color, the disparity is even greater. It is almost sinful. For [PERSON]4 women, it is [DATE] cents Native [ORGANIZATION]0an, [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]nIndian, and [PERSON] women, 60 cents and a [ORGANIZATION] is making just [DATE][DATE] cents for every dollar for the same work as men. Equal work, equal [TIME], equal efforts, but not equal pay. And this is not just about cents on a dollar. This pay [PERSON] H181[DATE] gap can add up to about 400,000 in lost wages over a career. What does that mean to a womans pension? At the same time, the need for action has been accelerated by the pandemic, which has worsened economic disparities for women. [DATE], women lost a net [DATE].4 million jobs during the recession, with losses disproportionately experienced by women of color. This unjust, uneven toll on women is expected to widen the wage gap by up to [DATE] percentage points. Widen the gap by [DATE] percentage points, even as the economy recovers. As the [ORGANIZATION] passes this landmark legislation, let us stand proudly, unapologetically for what this does for the economy of our country. We continue to work to advance progress for women and families. With the strong support of President [PERSON], the [ORGANIZATION] Democrats are proud to have passed and sent to the [ORGANIZATION] our bipartisan [PERSON]6WA reauthorization led by ORG2woman Sheila [LOCATION] [PERSON] legislation to remove the arbitrary deadline for [ORGANIZATION]61 ratification led by ORG2woman [PERSON] [PERSON]2 and to have enacted the [ORGANIZATION]n Rescue Plan, which is helping many women to return to the workforce. time 1[DATE]DATE24 And we will continue this drumbeat of action ensuring that the [ORGANIZATION] passes [ORGANIZATION] and advancing legislation to strengthen womens access to childcare, healthcare, workplace safety, and more. And as we move forward to build back better, President [PERSON]s alliterative phrase for how we have job creation in our country, we can only build back better if women are central to that effort. Advancing an economy in a country that works for all of the people in [ORGANIZATION] is very important to [ORGANIZATION]s families and [ORGANIZATION]s children. I urge a strong and, hopefully, bipartisan vote on [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. Fairness is an all-[ORGANIZATION]n quality. Fairness for women is essential because we know that when women succeed, [ORGANIZATION] succeeds. I thank ORG2woman [PERSON] and [PERSON]man [PERSON] for their leadership. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield 11[TIME] to the gentleman from GPE4[DATE] Mr. [PERSON]6. Mr. [PERSON][DATE]. Mr. [PERSON], I thank [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] very much for yielding. I appreciate the opportunity to speak, Mr. [PERSON]. All [ORGANIZATION]ns, men and women, should be treated equally and receive equal pay for equal work. I happen to be the father of two daughters, and I will do everything in this [ORGANIZATION] to ensure that that continues to be the case and is, in fact, the case. If this truly were an [PERSON] Act, Mr. [PERSON], I think we would have a bipartisan initiative here. We would have bipartisan agreement. The problem is this is not what it is, Mr. [PERSON], it goes well beyond dealing with equal pay. What it does is it provides equal pay for as many attorneys and trial lawyers as possible. And therein lies the problem. Once again, we have what looks like legitimate legislation that sounds good and feels good, Mr. [PERSON], yet when you look at the details, it is far left extremism, which poisons the legislation and doesnt allow reasonable Members like myself to be supportive. And this isnt the first time. This occurs very often, and it is the reason why we dont get things done, nor do we get bipartisan cooperation. Because cooperation is the [STREET] that we will achieve and complete bills of importance, particularly that are named equal pay for all, equality for all. That is what our goal is. It would be great if a bill like this had the substance that provided the ingredients to provide for equal pay. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the distinguished gentleman from [ORGANIZATION]9 Mr. [PERSON]8, the majority leader of [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON]9. Mr. [PERSON], I thank the gentleman from [ORGANIZATION], the chairman of [ORGANIZATION]0 for yielding, and I thank him for his untiring work. No employer . . . shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex, by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex. That was passed by the ORG2 of [PERSON], signed by the President of [PERSON] in [DATE]. DATE92, Mr. [PERSON], the [ORGANIZATION]ures belie that promise. The [ORGANIZATION]ures are a shameful recognition of the emptiness of that promise. [PERSON], I know the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION], not well, but well enough. We have served here together for some period of time. I hope she will take this with a measure of positivity. She is a feisty lady. She stands up for what she believes. And she is tough. All those things are said lovingly. [PERSON]0 help us if they paid her less than they paid every male Member of this [ORGANIZATION]. But we dont. We pay everybody the same, except, I will admit, the [PERSON] and myself, so perhaps I am not quite as detached. But everybody else gets the same. A person who comes in DATE9[DATE] gets paid as much as a person who has been here 40 DATE[DATE][DATE]s like me. Why? Because it is the responsibility and duties that we perform that are being compensated, not our gender. [PERSON], in this bill and every other bill that has dealt with equal pay--however, let there be no mistake, clearly, I pay people in my office who have been there for 10 DATE[DATE][DATE]s more than I pay people that have been there a DATE[DATE][DATE] if they are doing the same thing. Period. Experience counts. As a lawyer when I ran my law office, I paid people differently based upon their experience, their education, and other differentials, but not on the basis of gender. And like the gentleman who spoke before me, I have one more daughter than he has he has two daughters, I have three daughters. Mr. [PERSON], they would not be happy DATE1[DATE] if their dad came to this floor and voted against this bill, I will tell you that. I dont know about the gentlemans daughters, but I can tell you where my daughters would be. Mr. [PERSON], I am proud to bring [ORGANIZATION] to the floor, as I did last ORG2. The legislation is a critical part of Democrats effort to close the gender pay gap and ensure that women earn equal pay for equal work. [PERSON][DATE] did not get equal pay for equal work. Period. Unfortunately, she was prevented by [PERSON]0 from making her case. We corrected that. The [ORGANIZATION] passed a bill in [PERSON], but the Republican-controlled [ORGANIZATION] failed to do the same, a bill just like this. That was very disappointing, not only to those of us who have been working hard to close the gender pay gap in ORG2, but more so to the tens of millions of people in the workforce who deserve to take home pay they have earned. This is not a gift. This is compensation based upon ability and contribution, not on gender. In [ORGANIZATION] DATE1[DATE], a woman still earns on average just 82 cents to every dollar earned by a man. Mr. [PERSON]man, has that been disputed on this floor? From women of color it is even worse. African-[ORGANIZATION]n women earn on average only [DATE] cents to the dollar, while [PERSON] see [DATE][DATE] cents for the same work. For women who work full time, DATE16, the gender pay gap represents a loss of more than, as the [PERSON] just said, 400,000. That ought to be unacceptable to all of us if we believe in equality. This disparity does not only hurt women, it disadvantages their entire families, with womens pay critical to household incomes. Two-thirds of women are now either the primary breadwinner or co- breadwinner of their households, and womens earnings are the main source of income in more than 4 in 10 households, 40 percent. [PERSON], the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION] knows full well that historically we have underpaid women because we thought men were the breadwinners. They were the people who earned the money. They were the people who needed money so they could support their families. That is not true DATE1[DATE], if it was ever true. Those households ought not to be disadvantaged because women are paid less for the same work as their male counterparts. I mentioned in [DATE] the promise we made as a GPE88. In [ORGANIZATION][DATE], when I was majority leader for the first time, I was proud to bring the [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act to the floor and get it passed. [PERSON] H18[DATE] I congratulate Rosa [PERSON] who is on the floor DATE1[DATE], Mr. [PERSON]. She has been indefatigable and focused and untiring--I suppose that is redundant--in her efforts to ensure that women were treated equally. And one of the best ways to treat people equally is pay them the same thing for the same job. [ORGANIZATION] builds on its success by making it harder for businesses to hide the underpayment of women in their employ through nondisclosure contracts and imposing new civil penalties for those who violate equal pay rules, among other beneficial provisions. [PERSON], this has been in effect for DATE9[DATE], and we havent gotten there. Do we need some, yeah, lets get it done, this is what the law said in [DATE]? And we really meant it. So lets carry that out so when the bipartisan, nonpartisan reports are made as to who is making what for the same job, it will come back men and women are getting the same pay for the same job with the same skills and the same seniority. I hope the [ORGANIZATION] will take up this long overdue legislation and pass it so President [PERSON] can sign it into law and at long last make good on the promise of the [PERSON] Act nearly six [ORGANIZATION]8 ago. I thank my friend, as I just did, Rosa [PERSON] for the work she has done. I thank [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] on behalf of [PERSON]1, on behalf of [PERSON]2, on behalf of [PERSON][DATE], my daughters, on behalf of [PERSON]4 and [PERSON][DATE] and [PERSON]6 and [PERSON][DATE], my three great granddaughters and my granddaughter. What she has done, what we can do will make a difference for them, their families, and our country. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the majority leader for his compliments of me. When [PERSON]8 first introduced me to [ORGANIZATION]2 here he said, I was a feisty mountain woman from [ORGANIZATION], who goes bear hunting with a switch. And so I have cherished that description of me over the DATE[DATE][DATE]s. I am a feisty woman because I grew up extraordinarily poor. And the majority leader is correct, I would not tolerate discrimination against me. I wont tolerate discrimination against anyone. I abhor discrimination. I am also an Italian [ORGANIZATION]n. I abhor that kind of discrimination and have fought against that. I fought against racial discrimination. I doubt there are many people in this body that fought more against discrimination against women than I have or mentored more women than I have. However, the majority leader also said something that made me think of the phrase, all things being equal. Well, rarely are all things equal. Obviously, when all things are equal, we want no discrimination, everybody to be treated the same. That is what I want. I have one child, a daughter. I have two grandchildren, a grandson and a granddaughter. I certainly dont want either one of them discriminated against on the basis of anything. But, I say to Mr. [PERSON]8, yes, 82 cents has been disputed. We hear the same old tired statistics. They are not accurate. So lets stop doing that. Lets deal with the facts. [ORGANIZATION]0 is not the answer to discrimination. It is going to make it more difficult for employers to create jobs and to pay women and everybody equally. We need alternatives and we have one. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], may I inquire as to the time remaining on both sides, please? The SPEAKER pro tempore Mr. [PERSON]9. The gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] has [TIME] remaining. The gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION] has 41[TIME] remaining. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from GPE[DATE]0 Mrs. [PERSON]0, a co-chair of [ORGANIZATION][DATE]. time [DATE] Mrs. [PERSON]1. Mr. [PERSON], it is beyond me that in [ORGANIZATION]1 we are still having this debate on whether men and women are paid equally. And I just want to say to my colleague on the other side, being a [PERSON]4 woman in [ORGANIZATION], I can tell you I do not feel that she has had the discrimination and the disrespect in the pay scale that women of color have experienced. And during the brunt of this pandemic where women are in the forefront, those who are frontline workers, the service industry--predominantly women. Paycheck fairness corrects this injustice by allowing women to challenge pay discrimination and hold employers accountable. Many in this [ORGANIZATION]4 like to talk about leveling the playing field for all [ORGANIZATION]ns. Then lets do it by passing this bill. And in [ORGANIZATION], when you walk in the room as a woman, you know you have overcome and you have work to do. And please dont continue to disrespect us by saying that everything is okay. In your world it may be, but DATE1[DATE] we can correct that. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I have never said everything is perfectly okay. I said this bill is not the answer to what issues may still exist out there. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION]4 Mrs. [PERSON]2, and applaud her for how she has handled herself in DATE99 through all the turmoil and all of the challenges she has had. Mrs. [PERSON][DATE]. Mr. [PERSON], I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter from [ORGANIZATION][DATE] opposing [ORGANIZATION]0. [ORGANIZATION][DATE], GPE[DATE], GPE86, DATE29, [ORGANIZATION]1. Hon. Bobby [PERSON], [PERSON]man, [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION], GPE[DATE], GPE86. Hon. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], [PERSON] Member, [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION], GPE[DATE], GPE86. Dear [PERSON]man [PERSON] and [PERSON] Member [PERSON] On behalf of [ORGANIZATION][DATE], the nations leading small business advocacy organization, I write in opposition to [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. This legislation will add significant burdens to small businesses and potentially expose them to frivolous lawsuits. [ORGANIZATION][DATE] and its members believe in equal pay for equal work. However, [ORGANIZATION][DATE] does not believe that this legislation is the solution. [ORGANIZATION]0 will make legitimate business-related pay differences difficult to defend in [STREET], invite frivolous lawsuits against small business owners by allowing unlimited compensatory and punitive damages in equal pay lawsuits, and significantly increase small business paperwork burdens. This legislation would make it nearly impossible for a small employer to defend against claims where an alternative employment practice exists and could serve the same business purpose without producing a wage differential. Even if an employer were to demonstrate that a legitimate factor such as education, training, or experience accounted for a wage differential, an employee could claim that an alternative employment practice existed and that the employer refused to adopt such a practice. For example, an employee of a small, local hardware store would be able to sue an employer for refusing to adopt a business practice that a much larger company uses to address wage discrepancies. Forcing one-size-fits-all legislation on small, independent businesses puts them at a significant disadvantage relative to their larger competitors. A small business may have legitimate reasons for not adopting the practices of a large business. However, if an employee can prove that the independent business refused to adopt the alternative employment practice of a large competitor, the small business automatically loses the suit. This legislation also prohibits an employer from asking a prospective employee about wage history and prohibits an employer from relying on wage history in determining wages. These prohibitions create a very difficult situation for small business owners. A persons written resume is only one aspect of the application process a persons salary history is another essential part of gauging professional growth and development. If the needs of a prospective employee and the wants of a business do not match, the prospective employee and the business should be able to discern this sooner rather than later to avoid wasting each partys time and energy. By eliminating salary history, the hiring process becomes less precise and more difficult for small employers. This bill also puts significant paperwork burdens on small business owners. It requires [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] to issue regulations providing for the collection of employers compensation data. Most small business owners do not have a human resources department or a full-time staff member in charge of reporting and compliance. [ORGANIZATION][DATE] members find unreasonable government regulations to be their sixth biggest problem and federal paperwork to be their 1[DATE]th biggest problem when ranking their top [DATE][DATE] problems and priorities. [PERSON] H181[DATE] [ORGANIZATION][DATE] strongly opposes [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION], urges the committee to oppose the legislation in its current form. Sincerely, [PERSON]6, Vice President, [ORGANIZATION] Government Relations. Mrs. [PERSON][DATE]. Mr. [PERSON], I am pleased to be able to introduce this as a small business owner myself. The [ORGANIZATION][DATE] letter says [ORGANIZATION]0 will add significant burdens to small businesses and potentially expose them to frivolous lawsuits. In addition, the bill will make legitimate business-related pay differences difficult to defend in [STREET], invite frivolous lawsuits against small business owners by allowing unlimited compensatory and punitive damages in equal pay lawsuits, and significantly increase small business paperwork burdens. Moreover, the [ORGANIZATION][DATE] letter says that [ORGANIZATION]0 will make it nearly impossible for a small employer to defend against claims where an alternative employment practice exists and could serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. The letter also highlights the significant paperwork burdens [ORGANIZATION]0 would [STREET] on small businesses who do not have a human resources department, a full-time staff member in charge, or attorneys for reporting and compliance. Mr. [PERSON], having been a small business owner and supported by the small business owners, and during the pandemic when it is so necessary for us to get our small businesses up and operating, I urge my colleagues to take these views of small business owners into consideration before they vote on [ORGANIZATION]0. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]8. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]9. Mr. [PERSON], this bill is not just about DATE[DATE]9, it is about the future. [ORGANIZATION]-based wage discrimination exists in every [ORGANIZATION] and in many industries. In the tech industry, which has a huge presence in my district in [ORGANIZATION]s Research [ORGANIZATION], women typically make thousands of dollars less than men in the same roles. Unsurprisingly, women in tech often leave the industry due to unfair compensation, much to that industrys detriment. Pay inequity also follows women into retirement. Women have, on average, only [DATE] percent of the retirement income men have. One of the best ways we can help close the wage gap is through salary negotiation training, which is one of the key provisions of this bill. I am thankful to groups like [ORGANIZATION]9 and countless others working to empower women to help them advocate for their work. I urge my colleagues to support this bill for the sake of future generations. Mr. [PERSON], I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 this letter from the ORG91. ORG91, GPE[DATE], GPE86, [PERSON]4, [ORGANIZATION]1. [ORGANIZATION], GPE[DATE], GPE86. [ORGANIZATION] On behalf of our 180,000 members, advocates, and supporters, ORG91 ORG211 urges you to pass [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. ORG211 is a grassroots organization of volunteers and advocates who turn progressive ideals into action. Inspired by Jewish values, ORG211 strives for social justice by improving the quality of life for women, children, and families and by safeguarding individual rights and freedoms. The [PERSON] compels us tzedek, tzedek tirdof--to pursue justice. To that end, we advocate for employment laws, policies, and practices that provide equal pay and benefits for work of comparable worth and equal opportunities for advancement. Nearly 60 DATE[DATE][DATE]s after passage of the landmark [PERSON] Act, the gender [STREET] gap persists. Overall, women earn only 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, and the gap is much wider for women of color [PERSON]4 women earn [DATE] cents, [ORGANIZATION] women earn 60 cents, [PERSON] earn [DATE][DATE] cents, and some Asian [ORGANIZATION]n and [LOCATION] women earn only [DATE]2 cents. Earnings lost to these gaps are exacerbating the financial effects of [ORGANIZATION], falling particularly heavily on women of color and the families who depend on their income. [ORGANIZATION], which has been passed three previous times by the [ORGANIZATION], mostly recently in the 116th ORG2, offers a much needed update to the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] by providing new tools to battle pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination. We cannot build back an economy that works for everyone without ensuring that all women can work with equality, safety, and dignity, starting with pay equity. Passing [ORGANIZATION] would mark a vitally important step toward ensuring this becomes reality. I ask you to vote YES on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. Sincerely, [PERSON]0, Chief Policy Officer, ORG91. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]1. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]2. Mr. [PERSON], on behalf of [ORGANIZATION]21, I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 a letter of support for [ORGANIZATION]0. [ORGANIZATION]22, [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]1. [ORGANIZATION] On behalf of [ORGANIZATION]21, a network of over 200 local associations in 4[DATE] states and the [PERSON]6, I write DATE1[DATE] to urge the Representative to support [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 and vote no on harmful amendments. As the economy continues to struggle under the weight of the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic disproportionately affecting women and marginalized communities, there is no better time to take action to improve the economic security of women and families and strengthen our economy. I urge you to pass this bill without amendments that limit its scope or undermines its critical protections. For over 160 DATE[DATE][DATE]s, [ORGANIZATION]22 has been on a mission to eliminate racism, empower women, and promote peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all. From DATE10[DATE] providing skills and housing support to women entering the workforce in DATE104, [ORGANIZATION]22 has been at the forefront of the most pressing social movements--from voting rights to civil rights, from affordable housing to pay equity, from violence prevention to health care reform. DATE1[DATE], we serve over 2 million women, girls and family members of all ages and backgrounds in more than 1,200 communities [ORGANIZATION]. Informed by our extensive history, the expertise of our nationwide network, and our collective commitment to advocating for the equity of women and families, we believe that no one should have to choose between their livelihoods and their health, family, or safety. Yet far too women and families, including a disproportionate number of women and families of color, must make this choice DATE10[DATE]. This has become more clear as the effects of the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic become more transparent. The impact of the pandemic has fallen heavily on women and women of color. Women are especially likely to be essential workers, but they are also bearing the brunt of job losses, while shouldering increased caregiving responsibilities that have pushed millions out of the workforce entirely, resulting in an economic Shesession. [PERSON]4 women, [PERSON], and other women of color are especially likely to be on the front lines of the crisis, risking their lives in jobs in health care, child care, and grocery stores, all while being paid less than their male counterparts. The bipartisan Paycheck Fairness Act [ORGANIZATION]0 would help close longstanding gender and racial wage gaps by updating and strengthening the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] and ensure robust protections against sex-based pay discrimination. DATE1[DATE], on average, women in [PERSON] earn only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, amounting to an [ORGANIZATION] gender wage gap of 10,1[DATE][DATE]. Unfortunately, this gap is worse for women of color. Among women who hold full-time, DATE16 jobs in [PERSON], [PERSON]4 women are typically paid [DATE] cents, Native [ORGANIZATION]n women 60 cents and [PERSON] just [DATE][DATE] cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. [ORGANIZATION], non- Hispanic women are paid [DATE]9 cents and Asian [ORGANIZATION]n women 8[DATE] cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, and Asian [ORGANIZATION]n and [LOCATION] women of some ethnic and national backgrounds fare much worse. The [ORGANIZATION] global pandemic has exposed deepening economic disparities, further unveiling how the work performed primarily by women, and particularly women of color, has long been and continues to be undervalued and underpaid. It is time ORG2 addressed these deepening disparities and take steps towards real economic change for women by passing [ORGANIZATION]. We cannot afford to shortchange women as a result of persistent gender pay gaps and we urge the Representative to pass this bill without delay. [ORGANIZATION]21 urges the Representative to protect womens economic security and pass [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 and take critical steps towards strengthening womens economic security, particularly at a time when the country begins to recover from the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic. At this pivotal moment, ORG2 must take aggressive action to address the economic disparities disproportionately affecting women and women of color. We urge you to pass [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 without harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, [PERSON][DATE], Interim CEO amp Chief Operating Officer. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]2. Mr. [PERSON], GPE8[DATE] and I rise in full support of [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] H1816 As a nurse, I earned around 60 percent of what my [ORGANIZATION] male counterparts in the same position earned. I have often imagined how many people in my district experienced the same burdens, like how much overtime and missing wages we could have accrued DATE106. We have been chronically underpaid and chronically undervalued. I have stood up to [ORGANIZATION]ht for underpaid nurses before and I stand here DATE1[DATE] to [ORGANIZATION]ht for underpaid women, especially women of color everywhere. Pay [PERSON]4, pay [PERSON][DATE], pay indigenous, pay [LOCATION] women what were worth. Run us our money and run us our money now. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from GPE4[DATE] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]6. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON][DATE]. Mr. [PERSON], I thank [PERSON]man [PERSON] for leading and for yielding. Mr. [PERSON], I rise in support of [ORGANIZATION]. It has been more than five [ORGANIZATION]8 since the passage of the [PERSON] Act of [DATE], yet a woman still earns only 82 cents on average for every dollar earned by her male counterpart. Women of color fare much worse. [ORGANIZATION] will ensure equal pay for equal work. It is just that simple and it is just that overdue. [ORGANIZATION] and racial pay gaps persist, and earnings lost to these gaps are felt even more during the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic. This falls most heavily on women. [ORGANIZATION] will update and strengthen the [PERSON] Act to help close this gap. Pay inequities not only affect women, it affects children and their families. Though we have made strides in DATE[DATE]9, we know the issue of equal pay persists. We must not pass this inequity on. I want my granddaughters, [PERSON]8 and [PERSON]9, as well as my grandson, [PERSON]00, to live in a country where equal pay for equal work is the norm. I thank chairwoman and champion Rosa [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from GPE[DATE]0 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]01. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]02. Mr. [PERSON], did you know that over 40 percent of mothers are sole or primary breadwinners for their families? It has been over [DATE]0 DATE[DATE][DATE]s since the [PERSON] Act was signed into law, yet the problems that preceded that legislation remain DATE1[DATE]. So it is time for [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], across the country, women are paid 80 cents to the dollar that men are paid, and the number is significantly lower for women of color. [PERSON]4 women make roughly 60 percent to the dollar. Native-[ORGANIZATION]n women make about [DATE][DATE] cents. And [ORGANIZATION] women make just over [DATE]0 to the dollar. The discriminatory wage gap is costing women thousands of dollars a DATE[DATE][DATE] for doing the exact same work as their male counterparts. And I see this right here in my community and my district where women are forced to work longer [TIME], harder, just to make ends meet and put food on the table for their families. My community is one of the poorest in the GPE88, and the wage gap is one of the biggest factors for families who are really trying to get out of the cycle of poverty and get the support for their children so they can thrive. I am grateful to my colleagues on [ORGANIZATION] for bringing this long overdue legislation. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [PERSON]1 [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] [PERSON][DATE]. Mr. [PERSON], I thank the gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] and thank him for his leadership--also, the [PERSON] and the ranking member. According to [PERSON]6, based on [ORGANIZATION] wage gap, a woman who works full-time DATE16 would typically lose 406,280 over her 40-DATE[DATE][DATE] career. This means a woman making the median national salary for women would have to work almost 9 DATE[DATE][DATE]s longer than her male counterpart. Mr. [PERSON], [DATE] DATE[DATE][DATE]s after the enactment of the [PERSON] Act, full- time working women still earn 82 cents on average for every dollar a man earns, amounting to a DATE[DATE][DATE]ly gap of almost 20,000. They, too, raise children. They, too, have overhead. In this pandemic DATE[DATE][DATE], we have found that 2 million women have lost their jobs. We know that Hispanic women earn [DATE][DATE] cents, Native-[ORGANIZATION]n women 60 cents, and African-[ORGANIZATION]n women, on average, only [DATE] cents. It is time now to put this paycheck fairness bill on the desk of the President of [PERSON]. It modernizes and strengthens the [PERSON] Act, which is what the [PERSON][DATE] Act was, and brings the country one step closer to ensuring that women can receive equal pay for equal work. Mr. [PERSON], I ask for support of this legislation. Mr. [PERSON], as an original cosponsor, a senior member of the ORG212, on [ORGANIZATION], on the [ORGANIZATION], and a member of ORG2[DATE], I rise in strong support of [ORGANIZATION]0, the landmark Paycheck Fairness Act, which strengthens and closes loopholes in the [DATE] [PERSON] Act, including providing effective remedies for workers who are not being paid equal pay for equal work. I thank my colleague, the [PERSON] of ORG21[DATE], ORG2woman [PERSON], for introducing [ORGANIZATION] in every ORG2 since [DATE], which enabled me join her as an original cosponsor all during those DATE[DATE][DATE]s as we fought shoulder to shoulder for womens equality and empowerment. Mr. [PERSON], in [PERSON]2 [ORGANIZATION][DATE], the Democratic-led 111th ORG2 sent to the Presidents desk the [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act, the first bill signed into law by President [PERSON]0, which restored the critical rights of workers to challenge unfair pay in [STREET]. [PERSON], a Democratic-led [ORGANIZATION] will push for enactment of another critical fair pay bill--[ORGANIZATION] that strengthens current law. When [ORGANIZATION] has been controlled by a Democratic majority, [ORGANIZATION] has passed several times--including in the 110th ORG2, the 111th ORG2, and the 116th ORG2, when it passed by a bipartisan vote of 242 to 18[DATE] on [DATE], [PERSON], before dying in then- [ORGANIZATION] Majority Leader [PERSON]0[DATE] legislative graveyard. This is the DATE[DATE][DATE] to finish the job and send this critical legislation all the to President [PERSON]s desk for signature. Mr. [PERSON], as every woman Member of ORG2 knows, as our mother, sisters, daughters, and sorors in the workplace know all too well, the impact of the wage gap grows throughout a womans career. According to [PERSON]6, based on [ORGANIZATION] wage gap, a woman who worked full-time, DATE16 would typically lose 406,280 over a 40-DATE[DATE][DATE] career. This means a woman making the median national salary for women would have to work almost nine DATE[DATE][DATE]s longer than her male counterpart to make up this lifetime wage gap. Mr. [PERSON], [DATE] DATE[DATE][DATE]s after the enactment of the [PERSON] Act, full- time working women still earn just 82 cents, on average, for every dollar a man earns, amounting to a DATE[DATE][DATE]ly gap of 10,1[DATE][DATE] between full- time working men and women. The wage gap is also even larger for women of color. Hispanic women on average earn only [DATE][DATE] cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. Native [ORGANIZATION]n women on average earn only 60 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. African [ORGANIZATION]n women on average earn only [DATE] cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. [ORGANIZATION] has calculated that 10,1[DATE][DATE] for a median family in [ORGANIZATION] means [DATE][DATE] of rent or [DATE]8 of childcare. Indeed, if women were paid the same as men, the poverty rate for all working women would be cut in half and the poverty rate for working single mothers would be cut by nearly half. Because of loopholes in the law and weak sanctions for violations, the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] has not provided the tools to truly combat unequal pay. [ORGANIZATION] modernizes and strengthens the [PERSON] Act and brings the country one step closer to ensuring that women receive equal pay for equal work in the following ways 1. Requires employers to prove that pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons and puts the burden on employers to show the disparity is not sex-based, but job-related and necessary 2. Bans retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages [DATE]. Ensures women receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and national origin [PERSON] H181[DATE] 4. Removes obstacles in the [PERSON] Act to facilitate a wronged workers participation in class action lawsuits that challenge systemic pay discrimination [DATE]. Makes improvements in [PERSON]s [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE]s and [ORGANIZATION]s tools for enforcing the [PERSON] Act 6. Provides assistance to all businesses to help them with their equal pay practices, recognizes excellence in pay practices by businesses, and empowers women and girls by creating a negotiation skills training program and [DATE]. Prohibits employers from seeking salary history in determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not follow women from job to job. Finally, equal pay is not simply a womens issue, but a family issue. Two-thirds of mothers are either the sole breadwinner or a co- breadwinner in the household, so their earnings are vital to their families. When women bring home less money [DATE], it means they have less for the everyday needs of their families--groceries, rent, childcare, and doctors visits. [ORGANIZATION] is strongly endorsed by a coalition of more than 200 organizations, including [LOCATION]0, GPE88al [ORGANIZATION]01, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG90, ORG220, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]4, [ORGANIZATION][DATE], [ORGANIZATION]4, ORG222, [PERSON] Womens [ORGANIZATION][DATE], [LOCATION][DATE], [PERSON], ORG22[DATE], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]n [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]n Psychological Association, [ORGANIZATION], and many more. I urge all members to join me in voting to pass [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION]1, to ensure effective remedies for workers who are not being paid equal pay for equal work. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield myself the balance of my time. Women, in terms of employment and pay, have made great strides in this country. When I was graduating from high school, basically there were three open professions for women nursing, teaching, and being a secretary. We have come a long [STREET]. We have also come a long [STREET] in terms of wages. Do we have ways to go in this country in terms of the [STREET] everybody thinks about people who are different from them? We certainly do. Republicans and Democrats both agree that pay discrimination is repugnant and illegal. I will say it again and again. It is repugnant and illegal. Despite misguided claims from the other side, this underlying principle is not up for debate. Women should not be paid less than men for equal work. However, Republicans are not in the business of passing radical and prescriptive bills just to get flashy headlines and score cheap political points. We are equally committed to promoting both fairness and strong policymaking, and when judged by these standards, [ORGANIZATION] bill falls woefully short. Pay discrimination is illegal. You know, we have really heard nothing about the inadequacies of the current law or the current processes. What we have heard is that we need new legislation. Republicans disagree with that. Again, we want pay discrimination to be illegal and we want any such cases to be treated seriously and to be looked at. This bill offers no new protection against pay discrimination in the workplace, however. And that is sorely lacking in this bill. Mr. [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]0 is nothing more than a trial lawyer payout at the expense of hardworking women. I urge a no vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON], I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON], this is a critical time to secure equal pay for equal work. Over DATE[DATE]9 DATE[DATE][DATE], the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic has driven over 2 million women out of the workforce. As women return to the workplace, failure to strengthen the equal pay protections will exacerbate and entrench the gender wage gap for DATE[DATE][DATE]s to come. Mr. [PERSON], we all know that discrimination exists. [ORGANIZATION] will allow victims the tools they need to combat and also close loopholes that allows employers to escape liability for discriminatory pay differences. DATE1[DATE], we are talking about financial security for millions of families. Sixty-four percent of mothers are either the sole family breadwinner or co-breadwinner. We cannot continue to allow gender-based pay inequity to rob half of all workers and their families the wages they deserve. [ORGANIZATION] is our chance to finally help close the gender wage gap by reinforcing the [PERSON] Act and strengthening protections for working women. The bill would ensure that gender equality on the job is not an aspiration but a reality. Madam [PERSON], I ask our colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON]06 of GPE[DATE]8. Madam [PERSON], I have strongly supported [ORGANIZATION] and have done so for over two [ORGANIZATION]8. When the legislation finally got a vote in the [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]6, I voted yes I voted yes again in [ORGANIZATION][DATE] and [PERSON]. I have cosponsored [ORGANIZATION] since [PERSON]1. In [PERSON]2, I again enthusiastically cosponsored [ORGANIZATION]0--[ORGANIZATION]. In [PERSON][DATE], however, [ORGANIZATION]0 was radically altered during markup in [ORGANIZATION]0 with a new definition of sex that according to serious legal analysis will compel employers to subsidize abortion on demand. Because I respect the inherent dignity and value of unborn baby girls and boys who will be put at grave risk of death by dismemberment abortion and chemical poisoning if [ORGANIZATION]0 is enacted in its current form, I will vote no DATE1[DATE]. In a letter dated [PERSON]4, [PERSON] ORG2[DATE][DATE] said [ORGANIZATION]0 would amend the Fair [ORGANIZATION] Standards Act [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION], among other things, prohibits unequal wages between men and women performing equal work. 29 [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. 206dl. Wages include all forms of remuneration, including frinqe benefits such as medical, hospital, and accident . . . insurance, life insurance, retirement benefits, and leave. 29 [ORGANIZATION], 1620.11 Strengthening federal law to ensure equal compensation for equal work as between men and women is a laudable legislative goal, and we heartily endorse that goal . . . Unfortunately, [ORGANIZATION]0 has moved in a different direction . . . We believe that if the bill were to pass, the Fair [ORGANIZATION] Standards Act could be construed to require employers, including even religious organizations, to cover and pay for abortions . . . we urge members to oppose the redefinition of sex in [ORGANIZATION]0 and instead revert to the version of the bill that passed the [ORGANIZATION] in the 116th ORG2. The GPE88al Right to Life Committee opposed the redefinition of sex and opposes the bill. They said in a letter [ORGANIZATION]0 makes definitional changes to sex to include pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition. It is well established that abortion will be regarded as a related medical condition. See 29[ORGANIZATION].pt.1604 App.[PERSON]6 and [PERSON]1[DATE] v. CARS Protection Plus, [LOCATION], [DATE]2[DATE]F.[DATE]d [DATE][DATE] [DATE]dCir.[ORGANIZATION]6. Historically, when ORG2 has addressed discrimination based on sex, rules of construction have been added to prevent requiring funding of abortion. Since there is no rule of construction that would make this legislation abortion-neutral, it is likely that [ORGANIZATION]0 could be used to sue employers for a lack of elective abortion coverage. In like manner, the [PERSON]1 [PERSON] opposes the bill noting that [ORGANIZATION]0 amends the Fair [ORGANIZATION] Standards Act of [ORGANIZATION] by adding pregnancy childbirth, or a related medical condition to the definition of sex, which courts have interpreted broadly to include abortion. Other pro-life organizations urged a no vote including [ORGANIZATION]. Madam [PERSON], underscoring my commitment to the legislation without the redefinition of the term sex, [PERSON][DATE] I introduced H.R [DATE]-- [ORGANIZATION] with the identical [ORGANIZATION]0 language from [PERSON]2. H.R [DATE] is needed to ensure that the noble goals embedded in the landmark law, the [PERSON] Act of [DATE], are achieved. Among its provisions H.R [DATE] Prohibits employers from seeking the salary history of prospective employees. By banning reliance on salary history in determining future pay, the bill ensures that prior pay discrimination doesnt follow workers from job to job. Bans retaliation against workers who discuss their wages. Improves research on the gender pay gap. The bill instructs ORG2[DATE]4 to conduct studies and review available research and data to provide information on how to identify, correct, and eliminate illegal wage disparities. Requires the collection of wage data from federal contractors and directs [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] to [PERSON] H1818 conduct a survey of available wage information and create a system of wage data in order to help [ORGANIZATION] uncover wage discrimination. Provides a small business exception. The [PERSON] Act and the Fair [ORGANIZATION] Standards Act have an exemption for small businesses that generate less than [DATE]00,000 in [ORGANIZATION] revenues a DATE[DATE][DATE], and [ORGANIZATION] would keep that exemption intact. Supports small businesses with technical assistance. Provides assistance to all businesses to help them with their equal pay practices, recognize excellence in pay practices by businesses, and empower workers by creating a negotiation skills training program. I include in the [ORGANIZATION][DATE]0 the following letters of opposition. United [ORGANIZATION]s ORG2[DATE][DATE], GPE[DATE], GPE86, [PERSON]4, [ORGANIZATION]1.

See Economic [ORGANIZATION] for All, no. 16[DATE] [PERSON]6, Particular attention is needed to achieve pay equity between men and women [ORGANIZATION], no. [DATE] An urgent need to recognize effectively the rights of women in the workplace is seen especially under the aspects of pay, insurance and social security. [PERSON] [PERSON]0[DATE], Audience with Delegates from [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]0 [PERSON][DATE] And what I am about to say may seem obvious, but in the world of work women are still in second class. You might say, No, but there is that businesswoman, that other one . . . yes, but if women earn less, are more easily exploited . . . do something.. Indeed, ORG2 could do more in this area. Unfortunately, [ORGANIZATION]0 has moved in a different direction. On DATE29, the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6 marked up the bill to redefine the term .. sex to include such items as sex stereotypes, pregnancy, child birth, or a related medical condition, sexual orientation. gender identity, and sex characteristics. including intersex traits. [ORGANIZATION]0s redefinition of sex in the [ORGANIZATION] is seriously problematic. We believe that if the bill were to pass, the [ORGANIZATION] could be construed to require employers, including even religious organizations, to a cover and pay for abortions, contraceptives, and gender transition procedures in their health plans b treat same-sex civil marriages as equivalent to traditional marriages in the provision of spousal benefits, and c facilitate abortions and gender transition procedures by providing paid leave for that purpose as part of existing paid leave programs. In this [STREET], the bill would require many religious organizations to be involved in and to approve things they sincerely believe are wrong. Some may argue that Title VII already imposes all or some of these requirements. That argument--in addition to rendering the redefinition of sex in this bill seemingly redundant in whole or in part--overlooks the fact that Title VII has religious exemptions and abortion-neutral language that are not found in the [ORGANIZATION]. ORG2[DATE]8 has put off to [PERSON]8 the resolution of the question of exactly how the sex discrimination provisions of Title VII intersect with the religious convictions of employers. [PERSON]08 v. [PERSON]1. [DATE]0 S. Ct. [DATE], [PERSON]9 [ORGANIZATION]9. [ORGANIZATION]0 would raise a similar question but in a different statutory setting, one in which the critical religious exemptions and abortion-neutral language of Title VII are entirely missing. For these reasons, we urge members to oppose the redefinition of sex in [ORGANIZATION]0 and instead revert to the version of the bill that passed the [ORGANIZATION] in the 116th ORG2. Sincerely.

Re In Opposition to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0. [ORGANIZATION] DATE1[DATE]0, the [ORGANIZATION] will consider [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0. While the legislation is meant to address potential discrimination regarding the gender pay gap, the legislation was amended to contain language that could be construed to require employers to cover elective abortion in their healthcare benefits. Because of this change, GPE88al Right to Life urges you to oppose the bill and reserves the right to include a [ORGANIZATION] roll call on this measure in our scorecard of key pro-life votes of the 11[DATE]th ORG2. [ORGANIZATION]0 states that it constitutes discrimination to provide disparate wages based on sex, and the legislation creates more opportunities to seek remedies for those challenging compensation. ORG6 [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] has defined equal pay under the Fair [ORGANIZATION] Standards Act and the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] to include all forms of compensation, including healthcare benefits. [ORGANIZATION]0 makes definitional changes to sex to include pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition. It is well established that abortion will be regarded as a related medical condition. See 29 [ORGANIZATION] pt. 1604 App. [PERSON]6 and [PERSON]1[DATE] v. [ORGANIZATION][DATE], [DATE]2[DATE] F.[DATE]d [DATE][DATE] [DATE]d Cir. [ORGANIZATION]6. Historically, when ORG2 has addressed discrimination based on sex, rules of construction have been added to prevent requiring funding of abortion. Since there is no rule of construction that would make this legislation abortion- neutral, it is likely that [ORGANIZATION]0 could be used to sue employers for a lack of elective abortion coverage. Under [ORGANIZATION]0, a person could make a claim that an employers failure to provide health coverage for abortion is discriminatory if an employer provides health coverage for male-specific items. For the reasons above, GPE88al Right to Life opposes the current version of [ORGANIZATION]0 and reserves the right to include a [ORGANIZATION] roll call on this measure in our scorecard of key pro- life votes of the 11[DATE]th ORG2. Should you have any questions, please contact us. Thank you for your consideration of [ORGANIZATION]6 position on this matter. Respectfully submitted, [PERSON][DATE], President. [PERSON]1[DATE], Ph.D , Executive Director. [PERSON]16, [LOCATION] , Legislative Director. ____ [PERSON]1 [PERSON], [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]1. [ORGANIZATION] I write to advise you that [PERSON]1 [PERSON], on behalf of our more than 900,000 members, opposes [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION], which was amended at [TIME] to add a definition of sex that could force employers to cover elective abortion through employee benefits under the guise of fairness. [ORGANIZATION]0 amends the Fair [ORGANIZATION] Standards Act of [ORGANIZATION] by adding pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition to the definition of sex, which courts have interpreted broadly to include abortion. The abortion implications are buried in layers of [STREET] interpretations and regulations of [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE]. The Fair [ORGANIZATION] Standards Act [ORGANIZATION][DATE] prohibits sex discrimination in the area of employee wages. And while the [ORGANIZATION][DATE] does not explicitly include benefits like health coverage in its definition of wages, the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] has interpreted wages to include benefits. The [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] states that the [PERSON] Act, part of the [ORGANIZATION][DATE], requires that men and women in the same workplace be given equal pay for equal work. The [ORGANIZATION]8 and the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] further stipulate that equal pay includes benefits, and the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] allows a person to go straight to [STREET] with claims this provision has been violated. There is nothing preventing a person from claiming sex discrimination if an employer provides health coverage for all of mens health services but does not pay for coverage for abortion services for women. When the terms pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition were used in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act four [ORGANIZATION]8 ago, the terms were accompanied by language stating that employers could not be forced to cover abortion in health insurance benefits except to save the life of the mother. While [ORGANIZATION]0 does not override that limited safeguard, it does fail to extend equivalent safeguards to address its much broader, more sweeping reach. Without abortion neutral language in [ORGANIZATION]0, this legislation opens the door for employers to be sued for sex discrimination by simply refraining from funding abortion on demand in employee health plans. [PERSON]1 [PERSON] opposes and will score against [ORGANIZATION]0. Sincerely, [PERSON]18, President. [PERSON] H1819 ____ [ORGANIZATION], GPE[DATE], GPE86, [PERSON]4, [ORGANIZATION]1. [ORGANIZATION], GPE[DATE] GPE86. [ORGANIZATION] On behalf of [ORGANIZATION] and the millions of pro-life [ORGANIZATION]ns who march to end abortion, I am writing to voice our opposition to [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. While [ORGANIZATION] has no position on the original bill, inexplicably the bill language was changed this ORG2 to include troubling language that seems to have the singular purpose of promoting abortion. The definition included in [ORGANIZATION]tion 2 includes pregnancy or related medical condition, which amends the [PERSON] Act portion of the Fair [ORGANIZATION] Standards Act. This law states that it constitutes discrimination to provide different wages to individuals based on sex. The [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] defines equal pay under the [ORGANIZATION][PERSON] Act to mean all forms of compensation, including benefits. By stating that sex includes pregnancy or related medical condition, the bill establishes the expectation that women will be given equal benefits related to pregnancy and abortion. The legislation gives power to the [ORGANIZATION] government to use its full force to attack health care providers, including businesses, which do not include full abortion coverage in their plans, and be subject to the enhanced penalties laid out in the bill. Clearly this legislation is not about fairness, however it is pushing a radical abortion scheme that is opposed by most [ORGANIZATION]ns. For these reasons, [ORGANIZATION] will score against [ORGANIZATION]0 in our [ORGANIZATION] scorecard for the 11[DATE]th ORG2. Sincerely, [PERSON]19, President, [ORGANIZATION]. ____ [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]20 of [PERSON]1. Madam [PERSON], I rise DATE1[DATE] to express my support for the passage of [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]. This landmark legislation, of which I am a proud cosponsor, will close loopholes in the [PERSON] Act to better protect and promote effective remedies for workers still subject to inequitable and insufficient pay. Signed into law by President John F. [PERSON] in [DATE], the [PERSON] Act was the first anti-discrimination law addressing wage differences at the federal level. [PERSON], DATE9[DATE] after its enactment, women and minorities still face significant wage disparities despite making great strides in the workforce. According to a study conducted by the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]s [ORGANIZATION]n Community Survey, the median earnings for women in [PERSON]1 is [DATE], compared to the median earnings of 46k for men. Across the GPE88, women are only earning on average 82 cents for every dollar a man makes in similar, full-time positions. The differences are only exacerbated when you take into consideration that [PERSON]4 women make [DATE] cents, Native [ORGANIZATION]n women 60 cents, and Hispanic women [DATE][DATE] cents. As the first [PERSON]4 woman elected in [PERSON][DATE] and someone who has worked in fields dominated by men, I have witnessed and experienced firsthand the biases and hardships that women and minorities face in our workforce. That is why I am proud to announce that the advances made in this legislation are wide-ranging and significant. [ORGANIZATION] will protect working women against retaliation for discussing salaries, prohibit employers from screening job applicants based on their salary history, and finally require employers to prove that pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons. Additionally, this effort will make improvements to the tools available to [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] to enforce the [PERSON] Act. Madam [PERSON], as a member of [ORGANIZATION][DATE], I am committed to advancing the professional development and financial security of women and minorities in our workforce. That is why I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]21. Madam [PERSON], I rise DATE1[DATE] to express my support of [ORGANIZATION], a bill Im proud to have voted for in the previous ORG2. DATE1[DATE], women make up the majority of the college-educated workforce, yet only earn approximately 82 percent of what men earn. For women of color, the pay gap is even worse. This legislation is critical because it makes significant progress in eliminating pay discrimination against women by providing them the necessary protections and tools to combat sex-based pay discrimination. Simply put, ensuring that one half of the workforce is paid as much for the same job as the other half is a matter of basic rights and fairness. Women deserve better, and I look forward to voting for this bill once again. time [DATE]00 The SPEAKER pro tempore [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]22. All time for debate has expired.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to [ORGANIZATION] Resolution DATE24[DATE], the gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] Mr. [PERSON] and the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] each will control [TIME]. The [PERSON] recognizes the gentleman from [ORGANIZATION]. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Madam [PERSON], I yield myself [TIME]. Madam [PERSON], these amendments will require the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] to provide for the collection of [ORGANIZATION] compensation data for employees disaggregated by race, sex, and national origin add a requirement that employers post notices and distribute information electronically informing employees of their rights under this act direct [ORGANIZATION] establish a program to award grants to employers to engage in training and conduct self-audits to identify and reduce bias in pay practices direct the [ORGANIZATION]retary of [ORGANIZATION] to conduct a study and a research literature review of gender wage gap in the teenage workforce and reestablish the GPE88al [PERSON] Equity Task Force that had been set up under the [PERSON]0 administration to coordinate efforts between [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION]9 of [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2[DATE]4. These amendments will make meaningful improvements to the bill, and I urge a yes vote on the en bloc amendments. I reserve the balance of my time. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Madam [PERSON], I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in opposition to the en bloc amendments. Madam [PERSON], in [ORGANIZATION], discriminating in pay based on sex is illegal, as codified in the [PERSON] Act and the Civil Rights Act. Democrats claim [ORGANIZATION]0 will improve upon these bipartisan laws to create new opportunities for women to [ORGANIZATION]ht pay discrimination. What [ORGANIZATION]0 actually does is create new opportunities for trial lawyers to earn higher paychecks while offering no new protections for pay discrimination in the workplace. Unfortunately, I cannot support any of the Democrat amendments to [ORGANIZATION]0 because none of them addresses the numerous unworkable and onerous provisions in the bill. I appreciate that Representative [PERSON]2[DATE] amendment recognizes the very serious problems with [ORGANIZATION]0 by attempting to [STREET] a [ORGANIZATION] leaf on the expansive government data collection mandate in the bill. However, [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE], is still required to implement the draconian data collection scheme in the underlying bill, which is still extremely misguided, expensive, and unnecessary. [ORGANIZATION]0 requires business owners to submit reams of pay data to the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] disaggregated by job category, race, sex, and ethnicity. Moreover, the collection mandate also includes other employment-related data, including hiring, termination, and promotion data, which even the discredited DATE[DATE]6 [PERSON]0 administration pay data collection scheme did not include. The data collection mandate in [ORGANIZATION]0 raises several concerns. First, it puts at risk volumes of highly confidential pay data involving millions of individual workers. We all know of the widespread data breaches the [ORGANIZATION] Government has suffered. [ORGANIZATION]ond, [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] will not be able to manage or properly use this data. It has never been explained what exactly the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] will do with this data. Madam [PERSON], data is not the same as information. Third, this mandate is overly burdensome. Under the [PERSON]0 administration scheme, the data cells required from business owners when they file an [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], with [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] expanded 180 cells to [DATE],660. Let me say that again from 180 cells to [DATE],660. [ORGANIZATION]0s scheme will add on hundreds, if not thousands, of more data cells. [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] has estimated that with the new reams of pay data added, the collection will cost business owners more than 600 million DATE19. I doubt that is going to help one single woman in this country. Although this amendment purports to give [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] more discretion to implement the pay data collection, this data collection mandate should simply be removed from the bill. In any event, discretion cuts both ways, and the Democrat-controlled [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] may choose to implement a data collection scheme even more expansive. Let me be clear that the [PERSON]28 amendment does not improve the draconian pay data collection mandate in [PERSON] H1821 the underlying bill or the other serious flaws in other sections of [ORGANIZATION]0 we have talked about DATE1[DATE]. Representative [PERSON]29 amendment takes a longstanding reasonable requirement and makes it disruptive and unworkable. First, the amendment requires a workplace notice posting of a partisan special-interest bill which fails to address pay discrimination in the workplace. [ORGANIZATION]ond, under current law, covered employers must post a notice of the equal employment opportunity rights in a conspicuous [STREET] at the workplace. Employees who telecommute or otherwise do not have access to the physical notice must be provided an electronic version. Under Representative [PERSON]29 amendment, the employer must post electronic copies of a new notice on an internal website to which employees have access. This is unrealistic. [ORGANIZATION]0 applies to millions of small businesses that do not have websites, much less internal websites for their employees. In keep with the other impractical provisions in [ORGANIZATION]0, the amendment adds another onerous requirement on small businesses that will be stuck with the bill. Representative [PERSON][DATE]0 amendment would create a new program for [ORGANIZATION] to--I hate to say this word--train employers regarding bias in negotiation and other wage-setting practices. The amendment includes a non-exhaustive list of 1[DATE] wage- setting practices on which employers allegedly need education. Employers may understandably review this list as 1[DATE] new ways for trial lawyers to allege violations of the [PERSON] Act. I will compliment one aspect of Representative [PERSON][DATE]0 amendment. It mentions compensation self-audits. Republicans agree that self-audits can be a useful tool in combating pay discrimination, and we urge support for the Republican substitute amendment which encourages employers to conduct self-evaluations to identify potentially unlawful pay differences and to take steps to rectify any unlawful pay practices. Unfortunately, [ORGANIZATION]0 does not encourage these self-evaluations. Representative [PERSON][DATE]1 amendment reestablishes the [PERSON]0-era GPE88al [PERSON] Enforcement Task Force. This amendment would establish another politically biased government bureaucracy that includes agencies such as the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] and [ORGANIZATION] already tasked with enforcing laws against pay discrimination and ensuring compliance with those laws. Madam [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Madam [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] Mr. [PERSON]28. Mr. [PERSON]2[DATE]. Madam [PERSON], I rise DATE1[DATE] to urge my colleagues to support my amendment to [ORGANIZATION]0. I was privileged to serve on ORG2[DATE][DATE] and study physics as an undergraduate, and I have always been impressed with the [PERSON][DATE]2 uncertainty principle. It says you cant measure something without changing it. As a longtime businessman, we always wanted to be driven by data because you cant manage what you dont measure. Receiving equal pay should not have to depend on an anonymous note writer letting you know that you are being underpaid. Guaranteeing that women and men receive equal pay for equal work is a principle rooted in our [PERSON] commitment to equality and fairness. My amendment would require employers to report pay data by race, national origin, and gender to [PERSON] and for that data to be shared with [LOCATION]. It would lengthen the timeframe for inception of the pay data collection from 18 to DATE1[DATE][DATE], providing the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] with more time to develop and execute an effective pay data collection. I believe it is plausible, Madam [PERSON], to say that more than 90 percent of paychecks are prepared by software, either internal or external. I remember preparing paychecks by hand, but it is a very small business that does that anymore. That software will evolve overnight, probably through the course of this debate, and the burden is likely to be small. The amendment also permits, but doesnt require, the use of pay bands or [TIME]-worked data and provides the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] with flexibility in what type of compensation data to use. Importantly, it also gives the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] the discretion to collect additional employment-related data but also to consider employer burden, data format, and confidentiality. Pay data reporting by employers promises to shine light on race and gender pay disparities, increase the likelihood of employer self- analysis and self-correction, and identify the areas of concern for further investigation by enforcement agencies. Reporting this data will also allow the [ORGANIZATION]6[DATE] to see which employers have racial or gender pay gaps that differ significantly from the pay patterns from other employers in their industry and region. I can also say, after almost [DATE]0 DATE[DATE][DATE]s of adapting to [ORGANIZATION] regulations, almost every business can find a [STREET] to profit from it. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Madam [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Madam [PERSON], I have two additional speakers. Madam [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION]2 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON][DATE][DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]24. Madam [PERSON], I want to thank [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] for her comments, and I will share a tip because I am a former small business owner. So, there is this great thing called communication. You can chat with one another and talk about some of their rights, so I recommend it for all that ask. Madam [PERSON], I rise on behalf of the millions of women in the workforce that to DATE1[DATE]8 are still only making 82 cents on every dollar. My amazing colleagues have identified lots of stats that are very, very convincing with strong data. I ask DATE1[DATE] that everyone consider the 1[DATE] to 20 percent of the female workforce who have either paused or stopped their careers--or ruined their careers, which many would say--because of the pandemic. It has been devastating, as we all know. [ORGANIZATION] builds on the [PERSON] Act and the [PERSON][DATE] Fair Pay Act by making it harder for employers to pay women less than men for the same work. When woman return to the workforce, and I pray that they do, we must ensure that they are aware of their rights under legislation--verbally, electronically, by any means it all works--which is why I have introduced an amendment that requires employers to display a poster in their workplace or their employment worksite, or by email, or whatever they can do, so workers clearly understand that they have rights under this act. Madam [PERSON], I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment and this legislation so we can ensure equal work means equal pay. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Madam [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. time [DATE]1[DATE] Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Madam [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [PERSON]9 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON][DATE]1. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]26 of [PERSON]9. Madam [PERSON], I rise DATE1[DATE] in support of [ORGANIZATION] and my amendment to this bill. On average, full-time working women need to work well into the next DATE[DATE][DATE] to catch up to the salary our male counterparts earned [ORGANIZATION]2. DATE29 marked [ORGANIZATION]0 that womens salaries, on average, caught up to the salaries of our male counterparts in [ORGANIZATION]9. For several subgroups of women, this date wont come until later this DATE[DATE][DATE]. For example, as a [PERSON]4 woman, it will take until DATE[DATE]1--DATE[DATE]2--to make the same salary of our male counterparts as they did in [ORGANIZATION]9. The [ORGANIZATION]n people look to ORG2 to be a force for economic justice and create policies that are fair and just. It is simply wrong that in DATE[DATE][DATE] women still face pay inequity. That is why I am proud to support [ORGANIZATION], which will strengthen existing laws to ensure that women are getting the pay that they deserve. [PERSON] H1822 My amendment will build on this crucial legislation by reestablishing the [PERSON] Enforcement Task Force. This task force, which previously existed during the [PERSON]0-[PERSON] administration, will ensure [ORGANIZATION] agencies are working together to limit any potential gaps in enforcement of equal pay laws. Putting this task force back in [STREET] will bring us one step closer to ensuring that women finally receive equal pay for equal work. Madam [PERSON], I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the bill before us DATE1[DATE] to ensure that women are paid fairly. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Madam [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Madam [PERSON], I hope we would adopt these three good amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Madam [PERSON], I support equal pay for equal work. I dont know how many times Republicans have to say that, but we will keep saying it if necessary because equal pay for equal work is the right thing to do, but it is also required under two [ORGANIZATION] statutes, and in most cases it is being adhered to. ORG2 should focus on policies that will continue to increase economic opportunity and expand options for all workers. That is what we should be doing in [ORGANIZATION]0 looking for ways to increase economic opportunity and expand options for all workers. We shouldnt be doing away with pipeline jobs, we shouldnt be raising taxes, and we shouldnt be decreasing options for people to work in this country but that is what this administration is doing, and that is what the other side is doing. The Democrat amendments and the underlying bill fail miserably in terms of increasing options and expanding economic opportunity. It is pushing people into the bands, making everybody the same and treating everybody as though they have no individuality, they shouldnt be innovative, they shouldnt be creative, and they shouldnt strive for more. That is not the [STREET] to go. Madam [PERSON], I urge my colleagues to oppose the Democrat en bloc amendment and the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to [ORGANIZATION] Resolution DATE24[DATE], the previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from [ORGANIZATION]. The question is on the amendments en bloc. The question was taken and the [PERSON] pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Madam [PERSON], on that I demand the yeas and nays. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section [DATE]s of [ORGANIZATION] Resolution8, the yeas and nays are ordered. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule [LOCATION], further proceedings on this question are postponed. Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mrs. [PERSON]2 The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part B of [ORGANIZATION] Report 11[DATE]-1[DATE]. Mrs. [PERSON][DATE]. Madam [PERSON], I rise as the designee of Representative [PERSON]4, and I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The [PERSON] will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows [PERSON] all of the bill and insert the following SEGPE[DATE]ION 1. SHORT [ORGANIZATION]. This Act may be referred to as the Wage Equity Act of [ORGANIZATION]1. [ORGANIZATION]. 2. FINDINGS. 1 In [DATE], ORG2 passed on a bipartisan basis the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] to prohibit discrimination on account of sex in the payment of wages for equal work performed by employees for employers engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce. 2 Following the passage of such Act, in DATE18, ORG2 passed on a bipartisan basis the Civil Rights Act of DATE18. Since the passage of both the [PERSON] Act of [DATE] and the Civil Rights Act of DATE18, women have made significant strides, both in the workforce and in their educational pursuits. [DATE] Prior to the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic, there were over [DATE][DATE],000,000 women in the workforce, the most in [ORGANIZATION]n history. Of the 2,000,000 jobs created in [PERSON], [DATE][DATE] percent went to women. This follows a trend that has been rising for some time. Women are graduating from college at a higher rate than their male counter parts, making up 61 percent of all college degrees conferred in DATE[DATE]4. Additionally, according to a recent survey of working women, more than half are their familys primary breadwinner. 4 The [ORGANIZATION] pandemic has had a significant impact on working women, resulting in over 2 million women leaving the workforce since February [ORGANIZATION]9. [DATE] Despite these advances there is still concern among the [ORGANIZATION]n public that gender-based wage discrimination has not been eliminated. [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE].

[ORGANIZATION]. [DATE]. ORG2[DATE] STUDY. The Comptroller General shall, not later than DATE[DATE][DATE] after the date of the enactment of this Act, submit to ORG2 a study on the causes and effects of-- 1 wage disparities among men and women 2 with respect to employees that leave the workforce for parental reasons commonly referred to as the Managers Gap, the impact on wages and opportunity potential and [DATE] the disparities in negotiation skills among men and women upon entering the workforce. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to [ORGANIZATION] Resolution DATE24[DATE], the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION]4 Mrs. [PERSON]2 and a Member opposed each will control [TIME]. The [PERSON] recognizes the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION]4. Mrs. [PERSON][DATE]. Madam [PERSON], I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam [PERSON], equal work deserves equal pay, and we owe it to women to constructively engage on addressing pay disparities in the workplace and put forward real solutions. Unfortunately, Democrats have put forth a bill that prioritizes lawsuits and government regulation over womens economic empowerment and advancement. [ORGANIZATION]0 would require employers to make intrusive data disclosures that would add compliance costs exceeding 600 million per DATE[DATE][DATE] while posing serious threats to workers privacy and their paychecks. On top of these onerous new requirements, [ORGANIZATION]0 will force [ORGANIZATION]s businesses to prepare for an onslaught of frivolous lawsuits, which now will be open to unlimited compensatory and limited damages. Forty percent of small businesses are run by women, and [ORGANIZATION]0 would make it harder for these women business owners to succeed. This issue is too important to leave to partisan solutions. Our amendment, the Wage Equity Act, offers a stark contrast to the approach laid out in [ORGANIZATION]0. We look to innovation in the [ORGANIZATION]s to find bipartisan policy that is supported by both Republicans and Democrats and signed by [ORGANIZATION]--proof that equal pay for equal work is not a partisan issue. The Wage Equity Act supports the empowerment of women in [ORGANIZATION] economy. [ORGANIZATION]s businesses--particularly our small businesses--seek to do right by their employees. In recognition of this, the Wage Equity Act creates a voluntary pay analysis system to encourage the good-faith efforts of employers to self-identify and correct any wage disparities, should they exist, creating an environment of consistent self- reflection. We believe every [ORGANIZATION]n should be able to negotiate employment based upon their qualifications and merit for the position, and that a victim of wage discrimination should not have this discrimination follow them to their next job and compound through the rest of their career. This is why this amendment protects the employees right to not disclose their salary history during the job interview process unless they wish to do so voluntarily. At the same time, we cannot erode the necessary negotiations that take [STREET] in a job interview. The Wage Equity Act protects the ability for an employee and their prospective employer to have a pay expectation conversation, an important part of any negotiation. Our amendment protects employees ability to discuss compensation with [PERSON] H1824 their colleagues while giving employers the ability to set reasonable limitations on the time, location, and manner of this activity to protect employees from harassment. Furthermore, the Wage Equity Act seeks to put women on equal footing as men as they start their careers with a grant program targeted towards women in college and career tech programs to provide negotiation skills education. Lastly, our amendment directs the ORG2[DATE] to study the managers gap to give us a clearer sense of the impact new parents leaving the workforce have on an employees future earning and opportunity potential. These are commonsense proposals that are supported by both Democrats and Republicans alike. I encourage my colleagues to reject partisan Government overreach and to support practical, bipartisan solutions that improve the existing law of the land--equal pay for equal work--by voting for the [PERSON]4 amendment. Madam [PERSON], I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Madam [PERSON], I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for [TIME]. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Madam [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from GPE8 Mrs. [PERSON][DATE]4. Mrs. [PERSON][DATE][DATE]. Madam [PERSON], this amendment would allow employers to self-audit compensation disparity. Asking the same employer, who may be engaged in pay discrimination, to self-police their wage practices is a blatant conflict of interest. Rather than actually incentivizing equal pay, as [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]4 would claim, this amendment gives employers the tool to hide evidence of pay discrimination and delay any resulting lawsuit and accountability by [DATE] DATE[DATE][DATE]s. The very idea behind this provision is insidious. It presumes that employers should be given loopholes to avoid liability after breaking the law. Employers do not need a workaround to guard against these types of lawsuits. Their best defense is simple do not engage in wage discrimination. In fact, this amendment actually creates another means for employers to discriminate on the basis of sex by preserving a vague standard for employer defense when accused of wage discrimination. Unlike [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]4s proposed amendment, [ORGANIZATION]0 makes clear that the any factor other than sex employer defense must be bona fide, job-related, and required by business necessity. Employees must be judged by their education, training or experience instead of their gender. As women drop out of the workforce in historic numbers due to the pressures of [ORGANIZATION], we have a responsibility to take every precaution to ensure they do not face discrimination when they return to the workforce. [ORGANIZATION] ensures all workers will get equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender. It will prohibit employers from paying women less simply because another employer paid them less in DATE[DATE]9. It helps to oppose pay discrimination with more speed and transparency, and allows women to [ORGANIZATION]ht pay injustices they may experience. [ORGANIZATION] fixes a systemic injustice that women have suffered. This amendment would only water down this landmark civil rights and labor legislation. Madam [PERSON], I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote no to this amendment and stand up for equity. Mrs. [PERSON][DATE]. Madam [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. Madam [PERSON], I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Madam [PERSON], I rise in support of this amendment, which was also introduced earlier [ORGANIZATION]8 by Representative [PERSON]4 as a standalone bill, H.R 2491, the Wage Equity Act of [ORGANIZATION]1. Unlike the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act, which will unfairly punish businessowners and reward trial lawyers at the expense of workers, this amendment will effectively address pay discrimination in the workplace and help working women by ensuring pay differences among workers of the opposite sex are due to legitimate business-related reasons. Among other commonsense provisions, this amendment will direct funds and research towards womens advancement in the workplace and will also authorize a grant program to educate women in college careers and technical programs on negotiating pay. This amendment will also allow job applicants to disclose prior salary history voluntarily, ensuring they control this information as they see fit. Madam [PERSON], I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Madam [PERSON], I yield [TIME] to the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], who is the sponsor of the underlying legislation. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]2. Madam [PERSON], the gender pay gap is a pervasive problem that demands thoughtful, multipronged solutions. [ORGANIZATION] represents a comprehensive response to the shortcomings of existing law and addresses the holes that have emerged over time. Representative [PERSON]4s substitute, the Wage Equity Act, is exactly what [ORGANIZATION] has been [ORGANIZATION]hting over the DATE[DATE][DATE]s. It purports to offer protections, but, in reality, it creates loopholes that give a wink and a nod to discrimination. Not only would it offer empty protections, it would erode existing protections already in [STREET]. The substitute includes inadequate protections for workers who discuss or disclose wages. While ostensibly protecting employees who disclose or discuss that pay, it allows employers to [STREET] limitations on when, where, and how employees may do so, negating the point of the provision. Madam [PERSON], you cannot remedy pay discrimination if you have no idea that you are making less than the man across the hall. When workers fear retaliation for talking about their pay, any wage gap they face is likely to continue to grow undiscovered in the shadows. More egregiously, there is no mechanism for enforcement, as it would allow employers who conduct self-designed pay audits to escape accountability for unlawful pay disparities and deny a worker a remedy. I think it bears repeating that corporations do not feel free to sell us spoiled meat, lock our daughters up in ninth-floor sweatshops with no fire escapes, employ our underage sons in coal mines, force us to work 1[DATE]-hour shifts without overtime or a break because corporations experienced a moment of Zen and decided to evolve. No. They were forced into greater accountability and social concern by the legitimate actions of a democratic government. In other words, if we depend on goodwill or a self-audit, then we are all screwed. This amendment seeks to destroy the entire purpose of the bill and allows companies to evade accountability for violating the law. Madam [PERSON], I urge a no vote on this amendment and a yes vote for [ORGANIZATION]. Mrs. [PERSON][DATE]. Madam [PERSON], I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. time [DATE]DATE24 Mr. [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION]. Madam [PERSON], I yield myself the balance of my time. I would hope we would defeat the amendment. This just recreates the loopholes that we are trying to close. You have to start with the idea that there is a differential in pay. And what we are trying to do is-- if you can explain this in any kind of [STREET] that is business-related, then they get away with it. The Fair Pay Act says it has to be bona fide and required by the job. If it is not required by the job, why do you have a differential in pay? We can do better than this, and I hope we defeat the amendment. Madam [PERSON], I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to [ORGANIZATION] Resolution DATE24[DATE], the previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from [ORGANIZATION]4 Mrs. [PERSON]2. The question was taken and the [PERSON] pro tempore announced that the noes appear to have it. Mrs. [PERSON][DATE]. Madam [PERSON], on that I demand the yeas and nays. [PERSON] H182[DATE] The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section [DATE]s of [ORGANIZATION] Resolution8, the yeas and nays are ordered. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule [LOCATION], further proceedings on this question are postponed. Pursuant to clause 1c of rule XIX, further consideration of [ORGANIZATION]0 is postponed."

Nearly all of it was earmarked for payroll and benefits. Public health and financial risks led to the cancelation of the fair34, the organizations single-largest revenue generator at 7 million.
