buffalo,Terrorism ruled out in deadly border explosion Two people killed at Rainbow Bridge and customs officer injured,2023-11-23T00:00:00Z,Niagara Falls Review,The Buffalo News,"By early evening, the Buffalo News reported that Gov. Kathy Hochul had quelled fears that the incident was sinister in nature. Earlier she had said local law enforcement was working with the FBIs joint terrorism task force to monitor all points of entry to New York. There is no sign of terrorist activity with respect to this crash. We have identified that this is a local individual, she said during a news conference. The Niagara Gazette, citing law enforcement sources, said the vehicle was travelling at a high rate of speed in the wrong direction at about noon when it struck an inspection booth and exploded. According to the Niagara Falls, N.Y., newspaper, two occupants of the vehicle were killed and a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent was injured. CBP spokesperson Steven Bansbach said the employee was taken to hospital for treatment of minor injuries and later released. As a precautionary measure, Niagara Falls Bridge Commission closed all Niagara border crossings - the Rainbow Bridge, Queenston-Lewiston Bridge and the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge. Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority also closed the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie. All but the Rainbow Bridge had reopened by late afternoon. The border crossings were busy Wednesday due to American Thanksgiving on Thursday and upcoming Black Friday shopping day. Matthew Halliday, who was visiting Niagara Falls, N.Y., with his wife Shayna and their three-year-old daughter, were in the area of the bridge when the vehicle exploded. It was loud, but I thought it mustve been a car accident nearby, the Mississippi man said. My wife thought it sounded too loud to simply be a car accident, which she said right after the explosion occurred. The family continued on to the Cave of the Winds attraction to find it was closed. While at a nearby gift shop, employees instructed customers to leave as the store was closing. We walked back to our hotel after that and saw the heavy police presence as we made the walk, Halliday said. On the Canadian side, Ontario Provincial Police shut down the U.S.- bound lanes of Highway 405 leading to Queenston at about 2 p.m. You can expect heavy delays in the Niagara area, OPP Sgt. Kerry Schmidt said in a video posted to X, formerly Twitter. If you are planning on crossing the border please delay travel until we know those highways and closures have reopened. Also, the Buffalo-bound QEW in Fort Erie was closed at Central Avenue. Forrest Willett and Gil Robitaille were en route to Cleveland, Ohio, on Wednesday when they had already made their way onto the Peace Bridge. The Midland residents had plans to help feed 250 homeless people at a Thanksgiving dinner on Friday. We were right at the border crossing when all the lights went red, they closed the whole border, all of the Canadian border patrol officers left their booths and were walking away from the bridge, Willett said. The duo initially thought the incident was due to a labour dispute, but that changed about 20 minutes later when border agents approached their vehicle. Willett said they were told there had been an explosion on the Rainbow Bridge, and a bomb threat to the Peace Bridge. It was very unsettling and nerve-racking when we heard there had been an explosion and there was a bomb threat on the bridge that we were currently sitting on, he said. Everyone acted calmly, and were able to turn their vehicles around and return back to Canada safely. Uncertain of circumstances at the time, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons Canada was working closely with the U.S. and taking the matter extremely seriously before he excused himself to attend a briefing. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc called it a violent circumstance and a source of concern for both countries, but he had warned against speculation in the absence of more details. Initially sparking fears, the incident came just one week after the FBI warned a congressional committee about a heightened risk of extremism linked to the Israel-Hamas war. In response to the incident, Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority increased its security systemwide.

buffalo,The Double Terror of Being Black in America,2022-05-20T00:00:00Z,Atlantic Online,The Buffalo News,"Chaney went to Tops grocery store on Saturday afternoon to purchase the ingredients for her strawberry shortcake. Im picturing how Chaney must have intended to take her little cakes out of the refrigerator on Sunday after attending Elim Christian Fellowship. Im picturing this grandmother closing her eyes and swaying her head as she bites into her cake. Moments feel like minutes as she swallows. Bliss suspends time-especially strawberry-shortcake bliss.On Saturday, though, Chaney was one of 10 people whom an 18-year-old white supremacist allegedly murdered with an assault rifle. She survived the lethality of racist policy survived breast cancer like my mother and partner, at a time when Black women are the most likely to die of that disease. But Chaney wasnt able to survive racist violence. For Black people to survive both racist policy and racist violence is grueling. To live as a Black American is to be a survivor.Esau McCaulley America isnt ready to truly understand the Buffalo shootingChaneys killer denied all this. Racist theories deny the racist structure of American policies, the ubiquity of racist violence, and the obvious and ongoing structural violence revealed by racial disparities. The heartbeat of being racist is denial. The deeper the denial, the more diabolical the racist theory.The most diabolical of all racist ideas operating today-the theory reaching the very depths of denialism, the theory that replaces reality perhaps more than any other-is the Great Replacement theory, or GRT, a white-supremacist conspiracy theory cited in a screed linked to the Buffalo shooter. But versions of GRT have also been spread by Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump, and many other powerful political and media figures in the United States today. GRT denies the greatest white privilege life itself. It denies the greatest Black deprivation life itself.Great Replacement theorists believe that Democrats, liberals, progressives, immigrants, Black people, Asians, Latino people, Muslims, abortionists, and Jews are trying to replace the native-born and original white populations in their countries. No longer would I just accept our replacement, the author of the Buffalo screed said. No longer would I just accept our genocide. No longer will I willingly serve the people who are trying to end me and my race. I would have to take the fight to the replacers myself.What group did the Buffalo shooter choose to target? He selected an obvious, visible, and large group of replacers. He chose Black people, he explained, because all black people are replacers just by existing in White countries.Imagine how much a white supremacist has to replace reality in order to believe that white people-who remain on the higher end of nearly every racial disparity-are being killed off, that they are being replaced, that they are being harmed, and that to protect themselves, they need to attack the very Black people who are actually on the lower end of nearly every racial disparity. The Great Replacement theory wholly replaces reality, presenting the dying as the living, and the living as the dying.Black people are more likely than white people to die in pregnancy, before their first birthdays, and from heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, strokes, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease, and COVID-19-eight of the 10 leading causes of death in the United States.From 2019 to 2020, the overall life expectancy in the United States fell by a year and a half, the steepest decline since World War II. Latino Americans and Black Americans saw the largest drop in life expectancy three years and 2.9 years, respectively, while white Americans faced the smallest decline 1.2 years, according to a report from the CDC.From the JulyAugust 2018 issue Being Black in America can be hazardous to your healthThe racial disparities in life expectancy had been narrowing for decades. In 1993, white Americans expected to live 7.1 more years than Black Americans. In 2019, the gap was 4.1 years. But the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black people reversed the trend. In 2020, white Americans were expected to live 5.8 years longer than Black Americans.According to a preliminary analysis, life expectancy in the United States continued to decline in 2021, while bouncing back in other wealthy countries. This continued U.S. decline was almost entirely driven by deaths among white Americans, according to estimates-not because people of color are replacing them but, in part, because white people accounted for a larger share of people opposing COVID vaccines and the policies that reduce the spread of the disease, according to researchers. Some of the very people pushing the Great Replacement theory were convincing their white viewers, readers, and constituents to resist shutdowns, to not wear masks, to not get vaccinated. Why? As my Atlantic colleague Adam Serwer observed back in May 2020 To restrict the freedom of white Americans, just because nonwhite Americans are dying, is an egregious violation of the racial contract.Tragically, white people are still dying of racist whiteness and blaming their deaths on Black and Latino people, who are dying at even higher rates from the same racist whiteness-its structural violence, its unending terror, its vicious neglect. The most prominent Great Replacement theorists, who claim to care about white lives, dont seem to care about white lives as they pour toxic disinformation and racist ideas into white communities, causing many white people to hardly care about people of color. If theres anything white people should have learned from the pandemic, it is this To not care about people of color is to not care about people.Before I begin I will say that I was not born racist nor grew up to be racist, the screed said. I simply became racist after I learned the truth.Kathleen Belew White power, white violenceThe Buffalo killer started to be racist when he learned to deny the truth. The historical truth is that racist policy has allowed white Americans to enjoy remarkable unearned privilege. Efforts to roll back racist policy, to create equity, are not an attack on white people but an attack on racism. As white privileges are rolled back, the privileges of living in a democratic, healthy, safe, equitable, and just society are rolled forward for everyone in the society, including white people.But n Great Replacement theorists refuse to acknowledge all the porous conditions and policies causing white people to die at high rates from all the leading causes of death-and people of color to die at even higher rates. They refuse to discuss racial disparities in mortality, in life expectancy. But if communities of color are particularly vulnerable, they have also responded to death and harm and disease by caring for others. Latino Americans 21 percent, African Americans 20.3 percent, and Asian Americans 19.7 percent have a higher reported prevalence of caregiving than White Americans 16.9 percent. African American caregivers are more likely to experience high burdens from caregiving than their white peers, and on average, spend 10 more hours per week on caregiving.Ruth Whitfield, the 86-year-old mother of a retired Buffalo fire commissioner, visited her husband at a nursing home, a visit she made every day without fail. After her visit on Saturday, she stopped by Tops for groceries. She was killed. Roberta Drury, 32 years old, shopped all the time at Tops for her brother and his family. We dont really have family in the area, so it was just a great help that she could do something for us like that, her brother, Christopher Moyer, told NPR. Moyer needed this help because he is recovering from leukemia. His sister was killed too.Black and Latino people with acute myeloid leukemia AML are more likely to die of the disease than white people. Structural racism assessed by census tract variables accounts for nearly all Black-White and Hispanic-White disparity in AML survival, researchers found in a recent study in Blood.Structural racism killed Black people in east Buffalo and then the gunman killed the survivors. In 2018, a local report found the Buffalo-Niagara region to be one of the most segregated in the nation. Segregation imposes a wide range of costs on people of color, impairing their health, education, job access, and wealth, the Partnership for the Public Goodconcluded. Individuals living in segregated neighborhoods tend to have less access to services that allow adequate standards of living, and their economic mobility is severely impaired. The neighborhood that the white supremacist targeted had long experienced food apartheid the Tops grocery store was the only nearby source of fresh, nutritious food, reported The Buffalo News.The victims of this white supremacist had been striving to address the effects of racist policy and make up for the lack of goods and services in this Black community. Deacon Heyward Patterson often drove people to this sole grocery store and had gone to the soup kitchen before going to Tops on Saturday. The white supremacist killed Patterson as he helped someone put packages in their car.Helen Lewis The intersectionality of hatePearly Young-Miss Pearly, as the 77-year-old was known-ran a food pantry in the area for 25 years. At church, she taught Sunday school, worked with youth, and often cooked large pots of vegetable soup for everyone. Katherine Massey, a 72-year-old member of a group called We Are Women Warriors, had written several letters to Buffalo publications calling for stricter gun-control measures to keep her community safe. She was killed by a man armed with an assault rifle and the lethal idea that Black people like her were the replacers. The horror is unspeakable, like when enslavers cast themselves as benevolently paternal, and cast the enslaved, who they tortured, as violent beasts.It is one thing to deny the racist policy structure harming and killing Black people and other people. But the depths of racist denial are reached when white supremacists frame Black people as the primary perpetrators and white people as the primary victims of racial harm. This ideology stirs and justifies white-supremacist terror and the terrible veiling of lethally racist policy structure. Black people are facing the double terror of racist policy and racist violence. Victims of racism are being mass murdered again and again.But through it all, through all the pain and mourning, through all the Great Replacement theories replacing reality, Black people have been like the victims of this latest mass murder finding bliss with strawberry shortcakes, caring for the sick and shut in, and never wavering in our anti-racist resistance. Black people have never wavered in our efforts to abolish the double terror, have never wavered in our struggle to live, have never wavered in allying with other people facing similar racist terrors, have never wavered in the human pursuit of joy, of peace, of beauty. And we never will.",soup kitchen

buffalo,Sunburn   The morning read of what's hot in Florida politics   7.16.20,2020-07-16T00:00:00Z,Florida Politics,The Buffalo News,"Brad Parscale goes under the bus. Image via AP. ___ Gov.Ron DeSantis is no stranger to criticizing local2 and national3 media coverage of his pandemic response. But Senate Democrats said reporters havent done enough to hold the Governor accountable during his press conferences. When a Miami Herald reporter noted during Senate Democrats Wednesday news conference that the Governor has largely ignored previous requests by the minority party, Sen. Perry Thurston flipped the question on its head in defense of his caucus efforts. Sen. Perry Thurston flipped the script on the media treatment of Ron DeSantis. Image via Phil Sears. I noticed that during the Governors press conferences, you all in the media ask questions of the Governor as well, and sometimes, Im wondering are the questions going to be more direct from you all as well, the Fort Lauderdale Senator said. Thurston also noted a heckler who interrupted DeSantis4 by shouting, Shame on you! at the start of his conference in Miami Monday. That heckler provided more interaction and incitement in challenging the Governor, he said. When I hear the press conferences, Im listening, and all I see is the same-old-same-old, him giving excuses, you all asking a question, and him deflecting as if theres absolutely nothing wrong, Thurston added. Florida Democrats have made a growing list of requests to DeSantis about COVID-19, most of which have gone unanswered. Among other demands, Democrats have called for a Special Session5 on the virus, a mask mandate6, data transparency7, and a meeting8 regarding the viruss resurgence. Meanwhile, the Governor implemented a month-long safer-at-home order, partly meeting a Democratic request, before revealing reopening plans Democrats say moved too quickly. He has also repeatedly extended the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures. However, he gave no credit to Democrats for neither of those orders. Nevertheless, Democrats have sent repeated letters to administration officials and plan to make their own press conferences responding to the Governors briefings a regular occurrence. If were in Tallahassee, were holding our mics up, were standing up, were saying that this is ridiculous, and this is beyond the pale, Thurston said. We are past being upset about this. When the Facebook Live stream closed and Senators believed they had the Zoom room to themselves, they began sharing their private thoughts. But reporters who had connected through Zoom were still connected to the meeting. Sens.Janet Cruz andLori Berman agreed the press conference went well. We should show up and heckle. Thats how we should get our message across, Braynon quipped. We should all show up at his press conferences with press credentials and heckle him. During the conference, Cruz had taken an animated and personal approach9 by invoking her 87-year-old mother and deeming herd immunity as a strategy for impala on the African plains. But after the press conference, she started to take aim at the question by the Miami Herald reporter. Samantha Gross question kind of pissed me off a little bit because she was basically saying, Dont waste your time,  Cruz began before a Senate aide cut her off. The aide then began removing unwanted participants from the Zoom call. Its ok, it doesnt matter. Its the way I feel. I dont care. Write about it, she joked. SITUATIONAL AWARENESS GovMikeDeWine I am asking you, wherever you live, to wear a mask when in public. Some may question the wisdom of masks, but as we said when I was a prosecutor The jury is back.

Florida breaks 300K mark for coronavirus another 112 die15 via Terry Spencer and Bobby Caina Calvan of The Associated PressFlorida passed the 300,000 mark of confirmed coronavirus cases and reported more than 100 daily deaths for the third time in a week, prompting state Democratic leaders to accuse DeSantis of not acting aggressively enough to stem the virus. There is failed leadership in the Governors office, State Senate Minority Leader Audrey Gibson said during an online news conference shortly after health officials reported 10,181 new confirmed cases. The new report brings the total number of confirmed cases to 301,810 since the outbreak began in the state on March 1. The state recorded 112 deaths Wednesday, the third time in the past seven days it has reported more than 100, a mark that had only been topped once before last week. The state has now recorded 4,626 COVID-19 deaths. Sen. Audrey Gibson blasts the failures in the Governors Office. Workers behind infection spike at Florida nursing homes Nursing home and assisted living facilities have been reporting more coronavirus infections over the past month despite DeSantis order barring visitors still being in effect. Rather than loved ones, its employees who are bringing the coronavirus into the building. As reported by Arek Sarkissian of POLITICO Florida, Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Mary Mayhew is pinning the blame on asymptomatic health workers who are spreading the virus to residents unknowingly. State data shows an average of 2,606 nursing home residents a day tested positive last week, up 74 from a month ago. Over the same stretch, the infection rate among workers has nearly doubled. Ron DeSantis blames coronavirus testing errors on misunderstanding16 via Richard Tribou and Gray Rohrer of the Orlando Sentinel DeSantis said the errors in coronavirus results reported by private labs were the result of a misunderstanding of how those numbers should be reported. Labs usually report only the positive results on tests of other diseases but have been ordered by DeSantis administration to report all results for tests of COVID-19. DeSantis added that he doesnt fault Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees, the head of the Department of Health since its the responsibility of private labs to submit the data to the state. In Miami, Jacksonville and Orlandos Orange County Convention Center starting this Friday, testing sites will include dedicated lanes for those showing symptoms, DeSantis said, with a goal of getting results within 72 hours. Floridas hidden data skews COVID-19 test results17 via Mario Ariza and Angie Dimichele of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel Florida might be minimizing the depth of its COVID-19 problem by underreporting its rate of positive tests, experts say. The method used to calculate the positivity rate puts more emphasis on negative tests, skewing the results in that direction. A person who tests positive is counted only once, but negative tests can be counted repeatedly if the same person got more than one test. In addition, just as the pandemic raced out of control this month, the state changed the formula. It now mixes two different types of tests, including one that produces more false-negative results. The upshot of both factors is that the rate of positive tests, as quoted by the state, could make the situation look significantly better than it is, experts say. State and labs, including some in Northeast Florida, question accuracy of COVID-19 data18 via Clayton Freeman of The Florida Times-Union Florida Department of Health officials said that some laboratories have not complied with procedures for reporting negative COVID-19 tests, while some labs pointed to state errors for potentially distorting a key metric in management of the coronavirus pandemic. The statistical issues, which include the omission of negative tests from several labs as well as apparent errors in classification, further complicate the task of assessing the scale, scope and relative risks associated with the pandemic. Flagler Hospital officials told the Times-Union Wednesday that its COVID-19 testing data as displayed by the health department does not look complete. Though Floridas totals for positive tests, hospitalizations, and deaths remain unaffected, the omission of negative tests potentially inflates the states positivity rate. Officials claim otherwise, but Governor says Floridas COVID-19 message is consistent19 via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics Local officials this week have asked for consistent COVID-19 messaging from DeSantis administration, but the Governor on Wednesday responded saying he has stayed consistent. During a roundtable, Miami-Dade County Mayors called for unity and leadership on the states pandemic messaging. And Wednesday morning, education leaders broke with DeSantis and Education Commissioner Corcoran on the Department of Educations emergency order telling schools to reopen next month. The message with Miami-Dade is consistent, the Governor said. Im supporting the County Mayor and what hes doing. Im supporting those municipal Mayors. I may not agree with them on everything politically, but this isnt really about politics or its not about the typical tit for tat. Ron DeSantis argues that Floridas response to COVID-19 has been consistent. Senate Democrats want businesses rolled back to 25 capacity20 via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics Senate Democrats announced a plan Wednesday asking the Governor to limit businesses across the state to 25 capacity. During Phase Two of Floridas reopening process, DeSantis allowed restaurants, bars, retail and other businesses to open up to 50 capacity before state business regulators reversed the order for bars. Under Phase One, restaurants and retail were allowed to operate up to 25 capacity. But with the rising number of daily COVID-19 diagnoses, Senate Democratic Leader Audrey Gibson and members of her caucus criticized the state for opening too early and forcing counties to take the lead on certain orders. That created what the Leader called a disjointed way of getting us to safety. His hands-off approach is not working, she said. Hes losing the war against the pandemic, and that means the people of the state of Florida are losing the war against the pandemic. BACK TO SCHOOL? Voters reject Donald Trump insistence that schools reopen21 via Nicole Gaudiano of POLITICO A majority of voters oppose the Trump administrations demand that K-12 schools and day care centers be fully opened for in-person instruction during the coming academic year, according to a POLITICOMorning Consult poll. In addition, a decisive 65 of voters rejected Trumps threat to cut federal funding for schools that dont reopen, agreeing instead that schools need resources for continued virtual learning or other types of instruction. Only 22 said schools should have their federal money reduced if they dont fully reopen. Donald Trumps suggestion that schools open in the fall went over like a lead balloon. Image via AP. DeSantis cameos at education board meeting reopening order draws dissent22 via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics DeSantis made a surprise appearance at a state Board of Education meeting Wednesday, taking the opportunity to assuage concerns about reopening schools. The Department of Education has taken heat for ordering classrooms open next month, including from within the Board. The emergency order is creating confusion about whether schools can choose to stay closed, but school districts may close if their plan is approved by local health departments. The Governor emphasized the need for classrooms to take in students for the benefit of their education and their parents livelihood. Were in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic, but were also in a situation where we need to provide as many options to parents as possible in terms of the education of their kids, DeSantis said. Education commissioner defends order to reopen Florida schools23 via The Florida Times-Union More than a week after Education CommissionerCorcoran ordered schools to reopen in August, members of the Florida Board of Education on Wednesday said his order has sparked confusion, fear and angst. Corcoran deflected blame to the media and said his order was designed to offer parents and school districts complete flexibility. But the order said all school districts must reopen brick-and-mortar schools at least five days a week starting in August, unless local and state health officials direct otherwise. Board member Michael Olenick offered the sharpest criticism Wednesday, saying there appeared to be a disconnect between what Corcoran was saying and what the order stated and called on him to rescind the requirement brick-and-mortar schools to reopen next month. Republican lawmaker says Aug. 10 school start date would be potentially catastrophic24 via Danielle J. Brown of FloridaPhoenix A Republican state House member from Central Florida is urging school board members to back off sending kids to brick-and-mortar classrooms in August. I strongly encourage you to postpone bringing the majority of our students back for face-to-face instruction in August, State Rep. Rene Plasencia wrote in a letter earlier this week. An Aug. 10 start date for students, with an expected teacher return of July 31st, is potentially catastrophic. Plasencia, who also goes by Coach P, addressed the letter to Dear School Board Members, though it wasnt entirely clear which school boards were being referenced. Plasencia represents part of Orange and Brevard counties in the state Legislature. The July 13 letter was posted on a Facebook page by a group called Parents Across America - Florida. Rene Coach P Plasencia strongly recommends to hold off on opening schools. Alberto Carvalho on coronavirus in Miami-Dade We are not ready to reopen schools25 via Hatzel Vela and Andrea Torres of Local10.com Carvalho said that as long coronavirus cases continue to increase at the current rate schools will not be safe to reopen. Carvalho met with Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimnez and epidemiologists who believe that the ideal environment to reopen schools would require that less than 10 of the people who get tested in Miami-Dade County are diagnosed with COVID-19. The daily positivity rate in Miami-Dade was about 20 on July 5th and about 16 on Tuesday. It is actually counterintuitive and dangerous, Carvalho said. The positivity rate for children in Miami-Dade County has been high. According to the Florida Department of Health, about 40 of minors who have been tested in Miami-Dade for the coronavirus have tested positive.

The remainder, about 120 commenters, urged the board to delay the August start date or move completely to online instruction, she said. 28Palm Beach Countys health director called for online schooling. But she wouldnt put it in writing29 via Andrew Marra of The Palm Beach Post Palm Beach Countys health director was adamant. The worsening spike of new COVID-19 cases made it too dangerous for public schools to reopen, Dr. Alina Alonso insisted July 6 during a meeting of the school districts health advisory committee. Guided by her advice, committee members reached an informal consensus that campuses should stay closed, attendees say. Two days later, the school board agreed. But when school district officials asked Alonso last week for a letter outlining her concerns, the veteran health director declined, three public officials familiar with the matter told The Palm Beach Post.

Experts say it is not coming soon in South Florida30 via April Rubin of the Miami Herald All counties in Florida except Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach went into Phase 2 on June 5. Since then, the state has become the COVID epicenter of the world. While most establishments have reopened to some extent in South Florida, Miami-Dade schools wont reopen unless the county is in Phase 2. And some local experts say the county will not reach this designation anytime soon either. Palm Beach County School Board members have already said students will likely begin their school year online next month. Distance learning is also expected to continue in Broward. CARES Act funding is used to get homeless off the street but time running out for some31 via Christina Saint Louis of the Miami Herald Homeless people are seen as particularly vulnerable to the virus and so Fort Lauderdale sought to relocate some of them to a hotel using vouchers as payment. The city recalled the eviction notice later Sunday night after activists scheduled a news conference the next day to protest, but the vouchers will run out this week, promised assistance has not materialized. Both the city and Broward County are struggling to find permanent refuge for their homeless population. In Miami-Dade County, Ron Book, chairman of the board at Homeless Trust, began a similar program, placing homeless people in hotels to protect them from the coronavirus and storms. Our goal is to end homelessness, he said. Advocate Ron Book seeks to end homelessness. They dont know what theyre doing. Miamis public hospital misses out in CARES Act32 via Daniel Chang and Ben Conarck of the Miami Herald South Floridas safety net hospital administrators have tried everything to make room for more beds and increase the availability of nurses and other staff as their medical facilities swell with COVID-19 patients. They have canceled profitable elective surgeries, transformed auditoriums and classrooms into patient wards, and pitched tents outside emergency rooms to triage patients. Jackson Health CEO Carlos Migoya noted that the Jackson hospital system has lost 78 million this year. He said Jackson Health has received 75 million in CARES Act money so far, helping to offset the loss. But that money has run out, and Jackson Health missed out on the most recent round of CARES Act funds intended to shore up safety-net hospitals because of what experts called an error in the way HHS calculated financial eligibility. Top local doctor is seeing young people with symptoms33 via John Pacenti of The Palm Beach Post Florida once again is the national spotlight for all the wrong reasons as it burns up the record books on daily cases of the highly contagious coronavirus strain. DeSantis has waved away concerns, saying these new cases are mainly among young adults and they dont even have symptoms. A top infectious disease specialist in Palm Beach County says the Republican is only half right. Yes, younger people are getting COVID-19, but they are not asymptomatic. They dont need ventilators and often get over their illness in a few days, said Dr. Larry Bush of Wellington Regional Medical Center. The young people who are getting tested are the ones with symptoms, the majority of whom are not getting very ill, Bush said.

MORE LOCAL Hillsborough commissioners look to take COVID-19 rulemaking away from county emergency group35 via Brendan Ward of the Tampa Bay Times During its weekly meeting, the Hillsborough Board of County Commissioners voted unanimously to draft an order that would take the power to address COVID-19 away from the countys Emergency Policy Group. The proposal, brought by County Commissioner Les Miller, will be discussed during the BOCCs meeting on July 21 and voted on after an Aug. 5 public hearing. If approved, the order would remove the EPGs power to pass orders related to COVID-19. The group would still keep the power to address weather emergencies, like hurricanes. If the order passes, all orders passed by the EPG, such as the countywide mask mandate and state of local emergency, would be ratified and go under the power of the BOCC immediately.

Bradenton latest city to adopt COVID-19 mask ordinance37 via Emily Wunderlich of The Sarasota Herald-Tribune The city of Bradenton on Wednesday became one of the latest to enact a mask ordinance. It requires businesses to post signage encouraging masks, but does not require business owners to mandate or enforce them. The emergency ordinance, which passed unanimously at a special meeting, goes into effect on Friday, July 17, and lasts 60 days unless repealed or extended. Businesses that do not comply could be subject to a 75 fine after a warning. But the citys communications coordinator, Jeannie Roberts, says that enforcement is not the intent of the ordinance. This is not about fining people for not doing it, Roberts said. Were requiring our businesses to help people stop and consider how important it is to wear a mask. Under the ordinance, businesses are required to post visible signage that advises persons entering that face coverings are required or requested to be worn within the business establishment.

Seminole to dole out 20 million in CARES Act money for coronavirus relief41 via Lisa Maria Garza of the Orlando Sentinel Seminole County has received 20 million in federal government funds for residents and small businesses impacted by the coronavirus economic slowdown, officials said on Wednesday. The county earmarked 10 million in grants for eligible businesses, 7 million for individuals and 3 million for nonprofits. The money is about 25 of the 82 million from the CARES Act relief package designated for the county by the state. The remaining money will be released in phases. Officials said that the countys population falls just under 500,000 residents, so they received the money later than larger counties. Chairman Jay Zembower said the county will benefit from the timing because officials had a chance to seek advice from other governments throughout the state.

Trump team relaxed training rules for nursing home staff just as pandemic hit46 via Maggie Severns of POLITICO Shortly after the first coronavirus outbreak ravaged a nursing home in Kirkland, Wash., the Trump administration moved to fulfill a longstanding industry goal, waiving the requirement that nurses aides receive 75 hours of training and allowing people who study only eight hours online to become caregivers during the pandemic. The industry had been fighting for years to reduce training requirements, saying they make it harder to recruit staff. Advocates for older adults and families of residents say they fear the change was premature and contributed to the spread of the disease.

The new rule from the nations largest retailer, with more than 5,000 stores nationwide, comes as health officials and scientists point to wearing masks as a way to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But Walmarts new policy, which goes into effect on Monday, also means the company is wading into the kind of culturally and politically divisive issue that it has a history of avoiding. Shortly after the announcement, the National Retail Federation said it hoped Walmarts move was a tipping point in this public health debate and urged all other retailers to enact the same requirement. has become the largest retailer to require masks for entry.

In a first run of what could be a model for the rest of the state, a civil suit this week over a home insurance dispute gave a glimpse of how the justice system hoped to adapt to the new socially distant normal as COVID-19 cases surge in Florida. Jurors were selected via Zoom, attorneys made opening statements wearing protective masks and the trial was streamed on YouTube. It worked pretty well aside from some technical glitches and an awkward moment or two. During a Zoom call to pick a jury, some prospects forgot to unmute while answering questions and one even forgot to do the opposite during a bathroom break, producing a sound effect that drew a few odd looks among those on the call.

Scattered problems with mail-in ballots this year signal potential November challenges for Postal Service68 via Michelle Ye Hee Lee of The Washington Post Problems caused by a spike in absentee voting during this years primaries are serving as potential warning signs for the U.S. Postal Service, which is bracing for an expected onslaught of mail-in ballots this fall as states and cities push alternatives to in-person voting because of the pandemic. The concern extends to local elections offices that may be unaccustomed to aspects of the mail, such as the time it takes for parcels to reach their destinations and how to design their ballots to meet postal standards. Local elections offices are hiring temporary workers to process absentee ballots, and some local elections boards are adding options for voters to do curbside drop-offs of their mail ballots on Election Day. Florida GOP doctors Trump tweet to solve mail-in voting problem69 via Marc Caputo of Politico Trumps harsh rhetoric against mail-in voting is causing a big problem for Florida Republicans, who once dominated the practice here. So the state GOP came up with a solution They doctored one of Trumps tweets on the issue to remove the stigma. Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them, Trump said in the tweet. The rest of the quote was blurred out Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history. Bad things happen with Mail-Ins. Kanye West drops presidential bid report70 via Melissa Roberto of Fox News Wests campaign has reportedly been suspended less than two weeks after he shocked the nation with a tweet that confirmed his decision to run for president of the United States in November. According to a new report from Intelligencer, a get-out-the-vote specialist named Steve Kramer claims West is already out after the Yeezy founder hired both paid and volunteer staff to help him secure signatures in Florida and South Carolina to get him on the ballot. Kramer claimed Wests team was working over the weekend there, formalizing the FEC and other things that theyve got to do when you have a lot of corporate lawyers involved. A separate source, who remained anonymous, claimed to the outlet that they were hired for 5,000 to help West gather signatures in Florida to meet the states July 15 ballot deadline. The outlet claimed he needed 132,781 valid signatures from Florida voters in less than a week. MORE FROM THE TRAIL CD 3 Republican Kat Cammack raised another 250K in Q271 via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics Cammack raised another 254,000 for her bid to succeed exiting U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, her campaign announced Wednesday. The April-through-June report was Cammacks best yet, more than doubling the 103,000 she raised in the first three months of 2020. The second-quarter performance brings her to-date total to 461,000 raised. Cammack had more than 330,000 on hand on June 30, nearly double the 166,000 she had in the bank at the end of the first quarter. Cammack is one of 10 Republicans vying to replace Yoho, who made good on his promise to term limit himself out of office. Kat Cammack hits CD 3 fundraising with both barrels. Leo Valentin tops Republican field in CD 7 fundraising72 via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics Valentin added more than 120,000 to his campaign account during the second quarter, building his lead in the Republican primary for Floridas 7th Congressional District. In a news release, the campaign said it had cleared 460,000 in total fundraising as of June 30. Valentins campaign didnt state whether the new funds were all from donors or included candidate loans, though it did take some jabs at incumbent U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy. Im honored by the support our campaign has received, and well continue working to ensure we win the Republican primary to take on Stephanie Murphy in the general election, Valentin said. Through the first quarter, Valentin had raised about 211,000 and lent his campaign another 131,000. The account had 276,000 on hand on March 31. Carlos Gimnez falls further behind Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in CD 26 fundraising contest73 via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics Gimnez is trailing Mucarsel-Powell for the second straight quarter, according to the most recent financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission FEC. Gimnez raised just over 617,000 during the most recent quarter, which covers financial activity from April 1-June 30. Gimnez has now topped 1 million raised in just two quarters since he entered the race in January. Mucarsel-Powell, however, added close to 837,000 during the quarter, topping Gimnez by nearly 220,000. Overall, shes raised nearly 3.8 million this cycle. Gimnez, however, must compete in the Republican primary against Omar Blanco, the former head of Miami-Dade Firefighters Local 1403. That could further cause Gimnez to burn through his war chest more quickly in the next two months than Mucarsel-Powell. Heather Fitzenhagen says Republican leadership is lying about her immigration record74 via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics Fitzenhagen, in a fundraising appeal, accused the Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee of lying about her record. The political committee, headed by Senate President-Designate Wilton Simpson, supports Estero Republican Ray Rodrigues. FRSCC caught in a LIE about my record, an email blast subject line reads. In question is a negative ad from the committee slamming Fitzhagens record in the House on issues including immigration. Fitzenhagen turned her back on President Trump, refusing to ban sanctuary cities, the ad states. The ad also hits on subjects like providing certain benefits to undocumented immigrants. But Fitzenhagen took issue immediately with the reference to a sanctuary cities bill. State House candidates argue over Mid-Bay Bridge tolls75 via Tom McLaughlin of Northwest Florida Daily News Removing the tolls on the Mid-Bay Bridge has been a primary issue in this years race for the District 4 State House seat. While Jonathan Tallman and Jeff Hinkle are telling voters that if elected theyll see the toll removed or reduced, fellow legislative hopeful Patt Maney has questioned whether that can realistically be done. Tallman and Maney, who sits on the Mid-Bay Bridge Authoritys governing board, debated the issue in a Tuesday forum hosted by the Greater Fort Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce. If outgoing Rep. Mel Ponder couldnt get that done and Don Gaetz, as president of the Senate couldnt get it done we need to be careful when people tell us they can just do it, Maney said. Video seeks to punish Chip LaMarca and other South Florida lawmakers for supporting DeSantis coronavirus response76 via Anthony Man of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel The video, released Wednesday by the liberal American Bridge 21st Century super PAC, begins with a snippet of video that Democrats and their allies have become fond of using DeSantis in Orlando on May 20 when he mocked people who had criticized Floridas response to the coronavirus and touted what then looked like the states success in dealing with the virus. American Bridge threw that back at DeSantis, now that the state is a world leader in coronavirus cases. The Florida Department of Health reported 10,181 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, bringing the state total to 301,810 since the start of the pandemic. The video includes audio from four lawmakers, state Rep.LaMarca from Broward, and state Reps. Vance Aloupis, Juan Fernandez-Barquin, and Ana Maria Rodriquez from Miami-Dade County.

Israel learned he had the virus Tuesday night and went to a local hospital for further evaluation, according to a statement released by his campaign Wednesday. Like most of you, I took precautions, followed the advice of health experts, wore a mask in public, washed my hands regularly, and observed social distancing, Israel said in the statement. Yet, despite this vigilance, I have contracted the virus, Israel said he was tested at the urging of family and friends after experiencing symptoms for several days. Israel was receiving fluids for dehydration and undergoing further tests at the hospital on Wednesday, said Lori Parrish, a friend of Israels and former Broward County property appraiser. Scott Israel tests positive for COVID-19. George Soros interest in Orlandos State Attorney race opens crossfire83 via Scott Powers of Florida Politics Billionaire New York Democratic campaign financier Soros, who helped fuel Aramis Ayalas 2016 victory for Orlandos State Attorney Office, is showing interest again this year, providing indirect support for Monique Worrell for that office and opening crossfire between her campaign and that of opponent Ryan Williams. Soros appearance in the election has been limited thus far to some polling and research provided to an independent committee supporting Worrell. Williams campaign raised concerns about Soros potential involvement as possibly the first indication he might try to overwhelm the contest with outside money, as he did in 2016. Worrells campaign responded by accusing Williams campaign of using the same anti-Semitic Soros trope that the President of the United States also uses. Sheriff John Mina reacts to union pulling endorsement I have made difficult decisions84 via Jeff Weiner of the Orlando Sentinel The day after the union that represents Orange County deputies voted to rescind its endorsement of Sheriff Mina, he reacted by pledging to stay the course despite signs of mounting dissatisfaction within the agency. The changes I have instituted at the Sheriffs Office might have been the impetus of this decision, Mina said in a statement. If thats the case, I accept that. I have made difficult decisions and have levied harsh discipline for policy violations, including terminating deputies for excessive force. He added he is committed to having conversations with our deputies to improve and strengthen OCSO, and also to implement and enforce policies that keep our community safe and hold our deputies accountable. Recruiting bogus candidates is shady politics for scared politician85 via Scott Maxwell of the Orlando Sentinel Orange County Commissioner Betsy VanderLey is obviously nervous about getting re-elected and for good reason. She has cast a number of rotten votes, including one to give Universal Orlando up to 125 million to help build a road for their new theme park even as the county prepared to ask residents to raise their own taxes to pay for new roads elsewhere. And another vote supporting a toll road that would plow through an environmental preserve. Because nothing screams environmental protection like four lanes of concrete. So, with VanderLey running scared, her campaign team recruited and funded a bogus write-in candidate to run against her. That may sound strange until you realize how Floridas whacked-out elections work. TOP OPINION The pandemic could get much, much worse. We must act now.86 via John M. Barry for The New York Times With the coronavirus, the United States has proved politics hasnt worked. If we are to fully reopen both the economy and schools safely we have to return to science. The White House says the country has to learn to live with the virus. Thats one thing if new cases occurred at the rates in Italy or Germany, not to mention South Korea or Australia or Vietnam. Its another thing when the United States has the highest growth rate of new cases in the world, ahead even of Brazil. In the United States, public health experts were virtually unanimous that replicating European success required, first, maintaining the shutdown until we achieved a steep downward slope in cases second, getting widespread compliance with public health advice and third, creating a workforce of at least 100,000 to test, trace and isolate cases. Nationally we came nowhere near any of those goals. OPINIONS The nation is in a downward spiral. Worse is still to come.87 via George F. Will of The Washington Post Never has a U.S. election come at such a moment of national mortification. The nations floundering government is now administered by a gangster regime. It is helpful to have this made obvious as voters contemplate renewing the regimes lease on the executive branch. This year, the pandemic will be an accelerant of preexisting trends There will be a surge of early and mail voting. So, an unambiguous decision by midnight Nov. 3 will require a popular-vote tsunami so large against the President that there will be a continentwide guffaw when he makes charges, as surely he will, akin to those he made in 2016. Then, he said he lost the popular vote by 2.9 million because millions of undocumented immigrants voted against him. DeSantis, Trump missed their chance to fully reopen schools88 via Randy Schultz of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel Maybe DeSantis realized how callous he sounded in comparing the reopening of public schools to the reopening of a Home Depot or Walmart. Whatever the reason, the Governor pivoted Monday from his insistence that all students be back on campus next month. Parents, DeSantis said, should choose. Trump threatened last week to withhold money from districts that fail to reopen fully. In Florida, Education Commissioner Corcoran last week issued an order that all school boards and charter school governing boards must open brick and mortar schools at least five days per week for all students. A competent Trump administration would have started planning how to reopen schools as soon as they closed four months ago. A competent DeSantis administration would have done the same thing. Bullying the Miami-Dade school district to reopen in August is just reckless89 via the Miami Herald editorial board The monumental decision on whether to reopen Miami-Dade schools in August is not on Wednesdays School Board agenda, but its likely to pop up. After all, how to deal with this pandemic is the districts most crucial decision in ages. The burden of deciding whether we continue with online schooling whether we physically return to class return to class physically, falls largely on Superintendent Carvalho and the elected members of the School Board, who rely on his counsel. Carvalho has maintained that he will follow the advice of health experts and the coronavirus dashboard on what is best for the districts 350,000 students, parents, teachers and staff and the community. His is the most pragmatic, and empathetic, approach to this scary eventuality. Is close enough good enough for the high court?90 via Bill Cotterell of the Tallahassee Democrat DeSantis likes to recruit his new judges from the Federalist Society, an organization of conservative legal scholars dedicated to a textualist and originalist reading of the Constitution. So its significant that attorneys for state Rep. Geraldine Thompson used some originalist text in their challenge to the seating of Florida Supreme Court Justice Renatha Francis. In fact, they went to the high courts own advisory opinion in another recent case to make their point. Heres what happened Two justices resigned to take seats on the federal bench and DeSantis appointed Francis and Justice John Couriel to replace them. No problem with Couriel, but Francis is a bit short of being a member of the Florida Bar for 10 years, a requirement for appellate judges. TODAYS SUNRISE Florida has now logged more than 300,000 cases of COVID-19, with more than 10,000 new cases reported Wednesday along with 112 fatalities. The states coronavirus death toll to 4,626. Also, on todays Sunrise DeSantis tells the state board of education that schools will be safe when they reopen next month, but he says if youre not comfortable sending your kids back, there will be alternatives. The state Board of Education has some questions about the emergency order to reopen schools next month, right in the middle of a pandemic. Remember DeSantis slogan for reopening the state? Safe. Simple. And step by step. However, Senate Democrats have an alternative Step back to safety. Sunrise takes a deep dive into these disgruntled Democrats.

To listen, click on the image below91 INSTAGRAM OF THE DAY ALOE Disney Epcot quietly reopens with changes92 via Dewayne Bevil of the Orlando Sentinel Epcot emerged from its coronavirus shutdown Wednesday, representing another step in the phased reopening of Walt Disney World and its theme parks. The resort started reviving its theme parks with the Magic Kingdom and Disneys Animal Kingdom last week Disneys Hollywood Studios also reopened Wednesday. By now, many theme park goers know the drill Face masks are required, as are temperature screenings, physical distancing and a reduced capacity. On a very hot weekday at Epcot, that made for an attraction with more elbow room than usual and without the traditional snaking queues. Visitors arrive for the official re-opening day of Epcot at Walt Disney World. Image via AP. Disney Parks are nearly empty and that seems to be the plan93 via Christopher Palmeri of Bloomberg Walt Disney Co.s just-opened theme parks in Florida are so deserted that visitors are waiting five minutes or less to get on many rides, an eerie experience for people accustomed to long lines. Jay Scutt, who runs the Park Hoppin YouTube channel, visited the Animal Kingdom park on Sunday, the day after it opened to the public and found it lightly attended. I walked on everything, said Scutt, a frequent park-goer. Ive never seen the park like this. No doubt, many would-be visitors are wary of going to Disneys parks during a pandemic. But the thin crowds may largely be the result of limits imposed by a new reservation system, part of the companys cautious approach to reopening attractions. Reservations were quickly snapped up for last weekend, but the park still looked empty to many attendees. Its been a learning process for Disney. Sony boosting output of PlayStation 5 to meet surge in demand94 via Takashi Mochizuki of Bloomberg Sony Corp. is roughly doubling its PlayStation 5 production to 10 million units this year as it sees the prolonged effects of the COVID-19 pandemic boosting demand for gaming, according to people familiar with its plans. The electronics giant has informed assembly partners and suppliers its radically increasing orders for its next-generation console, though logistics may yet pose a challenge to delivering all those machines on time for the holiday shopping season, the people said, asking to remain anonymous. Sony had previously aimed to produce 5 million to 6 million PS5 units by the end of March 2021. A Sony spokesman declined to comment. Japanese business daily Nikkei earlier reported Sonys planned production boost of the game machine, which is scheduled to release this fall.

buffalo,The Democratic Fight Over House Leadership,2018-06-15T00:00:00Z,DownWithTyranny,The Buffalo News,"Does she? There have been more than a few discontented right-of-center Blue Dogs and New Dems already in Congress who say she should step now, primarily ambitious malcontents from the Republican wing of the Democratic Party like Kathleen Rice from Long Island. But lately enough normal Democrats are starting to whisper about her time being up as well. I dont know if she actually has the votes anymore.Some members have told me shes trying to broker a deal that would allow her to become Speaker again if she promises to step down after 100 days and retire-- allowing for a special election is San Francisco with her daughter Christine likely to follow in her footsteps. caveat I like Christine I dont like political dynasties.On Wednesday, a normal, garden variety Democrat and heretofore Pelosi backer, Brian Higgins D-NY, told the Buffalo News that he will not back Pelosi1 for another term as Democratic leader, complaining about the lack of a clear Democratic agenda as an alternative to Señor Trumpanzee and the increasingly radicalized GOP. He claims that his opinion is widely shared but only whispered. Ive found the same thing, complicated by how so many people feel like her and feels personal loyalty towards her. Higgins cited the lack of a clear Democratic agenda as an alternative to President Trump, as well as Pelosis lack of interest in his bills to expand Medicare and invest in infrastructure, as the key sources of his frustration.Shes listening, but this is my conclusion Shes aloof, frenetic and misguided, Higgins said....Im giving voice to a frustration that I hear every single day, he said. Its members. I dont want to call anybody out. But this is the conversation that is taking place.Higgins said his disappointment in Pelosi stems in large part from what he sees as his partys weak efforts to develop a compelling alternative agenda to that of Trump, a Republican.Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on not only in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan but in Cheektowaga, West Seneca, Hamburg, Orchard Park and Lancaster, he said. Democratic voters at least and voters writ large feel politically homeless, and its because we are not offering something affirmative to give people hope and something to invest in, in the way that we want to do things.Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, teamed up last July to promote a Democratic agenda called A Better Deal. The effort calls for increased federal investment in infrastructure, public housing and education, a series of political and labor reforms and an effort to reduce prescription drug prices.Higgins stressed that he did not mean to criticize Schumer or his role in that effort, but the Buffalo congressman had harsh words for A Better Deal.Its thematic, its well-intentioned, but nobodys buying it, Higgins said of the Democratic agenda. Its Washington-speak.Democrats would be better off, Higgins said, if they stressed two issues that he said arent stressed strongly enough in A Better Deal health care and infrastructure investment.Most notably, he mentioned the bill that he introduced last year that would allow Americans from the ages of 50 to 64 to buy into Medicare, the federal health care program for Americans over age 65.He said Pelosi and her staff have shown little interest in the bill.They say it does not comply with the essential benefits of the Affordable Care Act, Higgins said. That is not true....Higgins argued that his Medicare expansion bill would offer health care to a particularly vulnerable population middle-aged Americans who are coping with huge health insurance price increases because of Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. Every congressional district is home to approximately 14,000 such people,he said.In addition, he said the bill would stabilize Medicares finances, given that it would bring younger, healthier Americans into the system.Higgins Medicare expansion bill has 49 cosponsors, where his bill to invest 1.5 trillion in American infrastructure has none.A Better Deal includes a proposal for a smaller, 1 trillion infrastructure plan, but Higgins said Democrats arent doing a very good job of selling it to the public.Theres little mention of the fact that a huge infrastructure bill would create upwards of 34.5 million jobs and add 1.5 percentage points to the annual growth rate, thereby boosting the economy and cutting the federal deficit, Higgins argued.So infrastructure pays for itself and investment helps fund all the other Democratic priorities education, health care and the environment, he said.Higgins singled out Pelosi for failing to clearly articulate a Democratic agenda, and mentioned several current House members as possible alternatives to the current leader Current Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Rep. Karen Bass of California and Rep. Joe Crowley of Queens-- a close friend of Higgins.Karen Bass was elected Speaker of the California State Assembly in 2008, only the second woman to serve in that position. So she knows how to do it. Rated A by ProgressivePunch, she has one of the best voting records in Congress. Pelosi doesnt want to leave the speakership to Hoyer, which would be like leaving the speakership to K Street. The only thing worse would be leaving the speakership to Wall Street-- and that the most likely post-Pelosi Speaker Joe Crowley, a crook, a machine hack, a Wall Street puppet2 and, until he decided to run for party-wide leadership, head of the Wall Street owned and operated New Dems. I cant think of anyone worse.But he appears to have it sewn up. Most Democrats in the House are either enthusiastic about him or resigned to what hes made them all think is inevitable. What can we do? Crowley is virtually unknown in his own district where hes like an absentee landlord. He and his family live in Virginia. He has a credible primary challenge in less than 2 weeks June 26. His opponent, Alexandria Ocasio, is more of the district than he is. And shes making a strong grassroots attempt to dislodge him. If she wins, he wont be Speaker-- and Wall Street will lose its biggest patsy among House Democrats. Yesterday, Lee Fang, published a brilliant piece in The Intercept, How People Close The Joe Crowley Have Gotten Rich While The Queens Boss Has Risen In Congress3. His rise to the speakership could be another death knell for the Democratic Party. The crooks may be tolerated-- bad enough-- but they should never be the top man. Play Video4 The rise of Congressman Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., has coincided with lucrative lobbying contracts for his younger brother,John Crowley, an attorney who goes by the first name Sean, and previously specialized in wills and estate law.Sean Crowley serves as a partner atDavidoff Hutcher ...tron LLP, a powerhouse law firm with offices in Albany, New York City, and Washington, D.C., that advertises its ability to connect clients with congressional leadership.Over the last decade, clients with interests before Congress haveretained Sean Crowley through his lobbying firm, paying more than 4.5 million to influence and monitor government policies, according to a review of contracts by The Intercept.Clients in recent years have included Oracle, AbbVie, NBCUniversal, Juniper Systems, New York Community Bancorp, Abbott Labs, and Elections Systems ...ftware.In many cases, the interests of Sean Crowleys clients have overlapped with his elder brothers legislative and political work.Earlier this year, Joe Crowleyvoted in favor of President Donald Trumps effort to repeal a rule established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau designed to prevent racial discrimination in the auto loan industry.The legislation was heavily promoted by the National Automobile Dealers Association, the New York affiliate of which retains Sean Crowley as a lobbyist on regulatory issues, including cityrulesmeant to curb predatory lending practices.In 2013,Joe Crowley helped award 10 million in federal assistance to the Hunts Point Terminal Produce Cooperative, a merchants association in the Bronx that retained Sean Crowley as a lobbyist.In 2009, both Crowley brothers worked to assist the life insurance settlement industry. A fewmonths after President Barack Obamas inauguration,Joe Crowley, newly empowered with his first major leadership postat the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and a perch on the powerful committee dealing with tax legislation, traveled to Orlando, Florida, to address hundreds of financial representatives.JoeCrowley, speaking to the Life Insurance Settlement Associations annual meeting, reassured executives,and noted that Obama had made no mention of life insurance or life insurance settlements during his recent speech outlining his tax agenda, suggesting the audience might be spared from any future tax hikes.I think for your industry, that is a good thing, said Crowley. It doesnt mean that youre out of the woods, but its a good thing.The congressman encouraged the attendees to contact Democratic lawmakers on the Ways and Means Committee and continue to lobby to share their views.The friendly chat coincided with a lucrative contract for Crowleys younger brother, Sean, who was retained by the Life Insurance Settlement Association earlier that year to influence tax legislation on Capitol Hill. Sean Crowleys lobbying firm,Davidoff Hutcher ...tron, went on to collect 140,000 on behalf of the life insurance settlement client.The engagement with the life insurance settlement lobby also provided a lift toJoe Crowley. He was the largest recipient of Life Insurance Settlement Associationpolitical action committee donations during the 2010 election cycle....A report last year in the New York Post revealed that JoeCrowley has also paid nearly 70,000 in campaign funds to a company owned by Sean, calledKillean Enterprises LLC. Joe Crowley claimed the money was rent for a campaign office, though the space owned by the younger Crowley brother is outside the district.Before working as a lobbyist, Sean served as an attorney at a firm called Crowley, Crowley...ufman, a partnership with Scott Kaufman, the treasurer ofJoe Crowleys political action committee.JoeCrowley has faced years of headlines chargingthat he engagesin nepotism and unethical political patronage. As the boss of the Queens Democratic Party, he hasnominated associates to the borough election commission, helped allies win election to the New York City Council, and appointed family friends to the Queens Surrogates Court.The court appointments have gained increasing scrutiny after reports that associates ofJoe Crowley are routinely selected as court-appointed guardians who have earned millions of dollars processing the estates of residents who pass away withoutestablishing a will.Gerard Sweeney, an official at the Queens Democratic Party and a Crowley lieutenant, has raked in over 30 million administering estates through his position as an administration attorney at the Surrogates Court, which he won through hisrelationship withJoe Crowley.Before becoming a lobbyist, Sean Crowley also served as a court-appointed guardian. Kaufman has continued to serve as one, earning around 550,000from work assigned through theSurrogates Court. Notably, Kaufman now faces a state ethics probe for potentially violating court administration rules on compensation....The convergence of business and politics in the Queens Democratic machine reflectsJoe Crowleys ascent through the ranks of House Democratic leadership.JoeCrowleyhas gathered power through high-level connections with well-placed political figures and business leaders. The previous lawmaker to serve in his seat,Rep. Thomas Manton, D-N.Y., another Queens Democratic Party boss, quietlyselected Crowley as his successor just before the legal filing deadline in 1998, while deceiving the public and claiming he would run for re-election, a strategy that effectively prevented a competitive election.In Congress,Joe Crowley has served as a liaison between K Street and the Democratic Party, often mobilizing opposition to bank regulations and other rules opposed by major donors to the party. In 2005, he won a low-ranking position with the DCCC, helping to serve on an outreach council to the business community. ButJoe Crowley proved a prodigious fundraiser, helping to raise 5 million for the party, a capability that catapulted him to serve as vice chair of the DCCC four years later.In 2009, he was elected as the leader of the New Democrat Coalition, a moderate shame of Lee for referring to conservatives as moderrates caucus that used its political weight to weaken financial reform. Thecoalition famously threatened to defeat the Dodd-Frank financial reform law unless amendments were added to provide less stringent rules on derivatives and pre-emption of stronger state-based bank regulations. AsJoe Crowley and other New Democrat leaders marshaled political support for changes to the bill, the lawmakers went on a rapid fundraising spree, collecting checks from Wall Street banks that were seeking to influence the legislation.The Office of Congressional Ethics opened an investigation intoJoe Crowleys financial reform-related fundraisers, though the House EthicsCommittee, which outranks the OCE and is stacked with fellow lawmakers,later declined to continue the probe.In the years since passage of financial reform,Joe Crowley has continued to chip away at tough rules on banks while vacuuming up Wall Street donations. In 2011, he co-authored a letter requesting that regulators withdraw and revise the fiduciary rule, a high-profile consumer safeguard designed to ensure that financial planners act only in the interests of their clients. The following year, aftermeeting with bank executives,Joe Crowley and other New Democrats sent a letter to regulators requesting a delay to the Volcker Rule, one of the signature restrictions on big banks, designed to preventreckless proprietary trading.The letters, again, coincided with a steady flow of bank and corporate contributions toJoe Crowleys political action committees, which include a leadership PAC, a joint fundraising committee, and a personal PAC. Following the 2016 election,Joe Crowley was elected as chair of the House Democratic Caucus, making him the fourth ranking member in leadership.Now, the Trump administration has signaled that it is working to unravel both provisions of financial reform criticized byJoe Crowleys letters and is making headway in relaxing other aspects of the Dodd-Frank law. ThatJoe Crowley previouslytargeted thesame financial regulations that are now in the crosshairs of Trump contrasts sharply with the image the Queens Democrat has portrayed in his campaign advertising, which depict him as a bold opponent of the president.Despite a relatively conservative voting recordwhile representing a deeply Democratic district--Crowley not only has been a consistent friend to the banking lobby, but voted for the Iraq War, the Patriot Act, and a controversial bill in 2005 to limit consumer bankruptcy protections-- he is currently maneuvering to become the next speaker of the House.Last month, members of the New Democrat caucus providedstrong support for a Republican-led bill to increase the bank threshold for systemic risk assessments, raising the size at which regulators provide additional scrutiny from 50 billion to 250 billion in bank assets.Facing pressure fromAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive challengingJoe Crowley in the Democratic primary on June 26, the Queens Democratic Party chief abandoned his moderate pro-bank colleagues. This time, he bucked his New Democrat colleagues and voted against the bill weakening Dodd-Frank. Crowley, facing a tightening race, has begun to spend heavily on television to stave off a major upset, and has agreed to debate Ocasio-Cortez. It will air this eveningy on NY1 in the 700 hour. I tried explain yesterday afternoon-- here5-- many Democrats in Congress who want to stay on his good side or because they are afraid of him and because freshmen and sophomores are largely unaware of what a crooked conservative Crowley is are going along with his rise. The co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, Mark Pocan, who has the 3rd best voting record in the whole Congress-- and who should be a candidate for Speaker himself-- is actually whipping for Crowley and telling naive progressives that Crowley is trustworthy and a fellow progressive! Pocan is a good man... and he should know better. I would like everyone reading this to please consider helping replace Joe Crowley and the threat he is to the Democratic Party and to the country-- one Trump is already too much-- by contributing to Alexandria Ocasios campaign. And you can do that by tapping on the Blue America 2018 congressional campaign thermometer on the right and giving what you can.  1  2  3  4  5",homeless

Quebecers Weigh in65 These are difficult times for most Canadian families. The exorbitant price of gasoline is having an impact on the price of the grocery basket, which was already on the rise. In addition, there is the explosion in the cost of rent and energy, which is contributing to the impoverishment of the middle class and those who are already below the poverty line. The government does not want to remove taxes on gasoline because it is good for the environment. Premier Francois Legault, for his part, has decided to offer 500 to Quebecers to help them with inflation. 66 18 Major Airlines, FAA, And DOT to be Sued Over COVID Vaccine Mandates67 Authored by Enrico Trigoso via The Epoch Times emphasis ours John Pierce Law has filed a lawsuit against Atlas Air, on behalf of US Freedom Flyers USFF and Atlas employees, and plans to sue all major airlines, 18 altogether, plus the Federal Aviation Administration FAA and the Department of Transportation DOT, contending that the vaccine mandates imposed by these agencies on the airlines employees infringed on their constitutional, religious, and medical liberties. The lawsuit against Atlas Air was filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida, with over 100 plaintiffs pursuing litigation. Fundamentally, this case is about whether Americans should be required to choose between their livelihoods and being coerced into taking an experimental, dangerous medical treatment, reads the lawsuit 68 Antifa-Allied Democrat Backtracks on Saying the Homeless Should Break Into and Occupy Homes After Backlash69 Washington state congressional candidate Rebecca Parson, who was endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America and is allied with Antifa, previously said in a campaign ad that when she wins the election, a million people living in the US should break into empty houses and live in them so that Congress will pass housing legislation. After significant blowback, Parson is now changing her tune. 70 Apple Makes Further Push Into Digital IDs, With Drivers Licenses Now in Maryland71 Maryland has joined the ever-growing plan by Apple to get people to carry digital IDs. Citizens of the state can now connect their ID and drivers licenses to Apple Wallet to get a digital identification. A similar feature has already been rolled out in Arizona. At certain TSA checkpoints at airports participating in the program like Reagan National and Washington International, residents of Maryland can use their iPhone or Apple Watch to verify their identity. The digital ID will not replace the physical ID. The states website clearly states that law enforcement will not accept the mobile ID, meaning residents still have to carry their physical ID anyway. 72 Authorities Investigating Whether Retired Federal Agent Had Advanced Notice of Buffalo Shooting73 Authorities are reportedly investigating whether a retired federal agent, who allegedly regularly communicated with Buffalo supermarket shooter Payton Gendron online, had around a 30 minute advanced notice that the Tops shooting would occur. Two law enforcement officials told The Buffalo News that authorities believe the former agent, who is believed to be from Texas, was one of six people who had regularly communicated with Gendron in an online chatroom. 74 Bidens Disgraced Former Ministry of Truth Boss Blames Jack Posobiec for Her Downfall75 In Thursdays episode of NRPs Fresh Air, the former head of the Department of Homeland Securitys now-paused Disinformation Governance board called out Human Events Jack Posobiec as the beginning of the downfall of the group. Nina Jankowicz told host Terry Gross So I havent done a full analysis of what happened. I do one day want to pull all of the tweets and kind of look to see if theres any networks that are visible there. But what I think happened is theres a very kind of tried and true method through which messages travel in the conservative media ecosystem. 76 Breaking Texas Officer Gives Timeline of School Shooting, Admits Mistakes Were Made77 Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw held a press conference on Friday to detail the timeline of the Uvalde school massacre on Tuesday and address questions as to the law enforcement response. McCraw gave a timeline of events, one that had been lacking in the hours and days after the shooting when questions arose as to why officers did not immediately pursue the shooter into the school and attempt to prevent him from killing the 19 children and 2 women who lost their lives that day. 78 Breaking Instagram Suspends Libs of Tik Tok for Community Guidelines Violation79 UPDATE On Friday, Libs of TikTok announced on Twitter that their Instagram account has been restored. In a screenshot of communications with Instagram, the Facebook team said that the account had been disabled by mistake, and that the accounts login has been restored. Writing in response to the accounts restoration, Libs of TikTok said Thank you to everyone who spoke out against this censorship and demanded we be reinstated. 80 Caroline Glick Bidens Foreign Policy is Driven by Impulse, Not Reason81 Almost every day, questions arise about President Joe Bidens ability to make presidential-level decisions. The questions stem mainly from Bidens repeated rhetorical gaffes. In a recent column in the Boston Herald, Howie Carr assembled a sampling of dozens of Bidens misstatements since the start of May. Among the highlights, Biden told guests at the White House, I thank all of you for being here, and I want you to enjoy the rest of the recession. In a speech before an audience of policemen, Biden asked, How many police officers have multiple time and put a lion and had to do things that theyd have to think theyd have to do? Whereas Bidens domestic policy malapropisms are generally subjects of amusement or derision with few consequences, the same cannot be said of his parallel misstatements when it comes to foreign policy. Consider the war in Ukraine. In late January, as Russian troops were situated on the border with Ukraine awaiting Russian President Vladimir Putins marching orders, Biden gave a press conference in which he exposed NATOs disagreements by noting that the alliance would be divided over how to respond to a minor incursion by Russian forces. Confusion, and worse, impulsiveness, have been the hallmarks of Bidens decisions no less than his pronouncements. The helter-skelter withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan last August remains the paramount example of the impulsive nature of Bidens foreign policy. Biden ordered U.S. forces to withdraw, ending a 20-year war in humiliation and defeat without first coordinating the move with U.S. allies 8283 Court Ordered Release of Pfizer Document Reveals 82  97 of Vaccinated Pregnant Women Lost Their Babies84 A recently released confidential document reveals that a startling majority of in utero babies died after pregnant women were injected with the Pfizer vaccine. Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency PHMPT requested documents related to vaccine licensing via a Freedom of Information Act Request, then sued the Food and Drug Administration FDA. In early January 2022, a federal judge ordered the FDA incrementally release the documents it claimed would take decades to process. PHMPT has posted Pfizers confidential documents as they have become available. In the most recent release, on May 2, 2022, a document titled reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf disclosed on page 12 that by February 8, 2021, 270 women had received the mRNA injection during pregnancy. But 238 cases were apparently not followed no outcome provided. And, therefore, the pregnancy outcomes for those women are unknown. The mere fact that 88 of the pregnant women injected were not followed throughout their pregnancies is deeply concerning since 124 of the 270 pregnant women had some type of adverse reaction 49 nonserious, 75 serious according to page 12 of the same document. Among those 34 pregnancies that are known, the report indicates that 28 babies died either in utero or upon birth. Only one outcome was reported as normal, and the remaining five were reported as pending. 85 Daytona Beach Police 16-Year-Old Wanted for Stabbing Teen Girl Dies While Being Taken Into Custody86 DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.  Daytona Beach police say a 16-year-old suspect wanted for stabbing a teen girl died as officers were attempting to bring him into custody. According to a news release, Aaron A. Moten died at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando early Wednesday morning. The ordeal began around 830 p.m. Tuesday when Daytona Beach officers were called to Imperial Drive for a stabbing. They discovered a 17-year-old girl outside of the home, bleeding from multiple stab wounds to her arms, legs and head. She was rushed to the hospital and is in stable condition. Investigators found a bloody knife inside the home. Witnesses provided police a description of Moten and a K9 team tracked him, eventually finding him facedown in the backyard of a Continental Drive property. As Moten was being taken into custody, he became unresponsive, police say. Medics revived him before he was taken to Halifax Health Medical Center. The Orange County Medical Examiners office will perform an autopsy on Motens body in order to determine the exact cause of death 87 Elon Musk The Right to Bear Arms is an Important Safeguard Against Potential Tyranny of Government88 Space X and Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated in a Thursday interview that, while he espouses the idea of strict background checks and licenses for certain firearm owners, people should generally be free to own and bear firearms in America. 89 Elon Musk Dares AOC to Ask Her Followers Whos More Trustworthy Billionaires or Politicians90 The social media feud between Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-NY and Tesla CEO Elon Musk continued Thursday when Musk dared the politician to create a poll asking her followers who they find more trustworthy, billionaires or politicians. 91 Facebook Fact-Checkers Disagree on Definition for Energy Independence92 The left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing among Facebooks army of fact-checkers, specifically on the topic of whether or not the US is an energy-independent country, and at what point in time this may have been true or false. They also disagree on what facts should be used to define if that independence was reestablished during Donald Trumps term in office, and lost under the current administration. But what is certain is that the result is more censorship on Facebook and Instagram, affecting posts by Media Research Center MRC 27 times within one month earlier in 2022. Both have labeled this content as missing context, which could therefore be misleading. 93 Five Wisconsin Cities Face Lawsuits Over Unmanned Voting Drop Boxes94 The Thomas More Society on Thursday announced it has filed lawsuits on behalf of voters in Wisconsins five largest cities over illegal unmanned absentee voting drop boxes. Green Bay, Kenosha, Madison, Milwaukee and Racine face lawsuits for reportedly using the drop boxes, which are prohibited by Wisconsin election law. Thomas More Society Special Counsel Erick Kaardal said in a press release that the five cities made an agreement with the nonprofit Center for Tech and Civic Life to use the drop boxes to get these cities residents to vote. 95 Investigators Knock Down Claims DeSantis Administration Doctored COVID Numbers96 Florida investigators have rejected a former health department employees claim that she was fired for refusing to doctor COVID stats to benefit Gov. Ron DeSantis. The Florida Department of Healths Office of Inspector General found insufficient or no evidence that data scientist Rebekah Jones was told to manipulate or misrepresent pandemic numbers, NBC reported. Jones, who ran Floridas COVID-19 data dashboard, received national attention after accusing superiors of fudging data to bolster DeSantis case to ease restrictions. Florida officials denied her charges from the outset. 97 Johnny Depp Coming Out on Top in Court of Public Opinion, Experts Say98 Johnny Depp is coming out on top in the court of public opinion  and that could be even more important than whether he wins his bombshell defamation case against Amber Heard, experts say. Now that the 58-year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star has told his side publicly, legal and PR professionals told The Post a jury ruling in his favor doesnt matter as much. When Johnny Depp stepped off the stand, I think he already won based on his definition of winning, said Texas civil attorney Katherine Lizardo. Because he already obtained the favor of the court of public opinion once he told his story. 99 Liz Cheney Announces Bid for Re-Election, Trails Challenger in New Poll100 Rep. Liz Cheney formally announced her bid for re-election Thursday, the same day as the publication of a new poll that shows her 30 points behind her main Republican primary challenger. The survey conducted this week by Club for Growth reported that 56 of Wyoming Republicans would vote for attorney Harriet Hageman while just 26 would back Cheney. Club for Growth, which has endorsed Hageman, also found that 12 of voters are planning to back state Sen. Anthony Bouchard, while 6 are undecided. 101 Man Stabbed to Death by Door-to-Door Salesman During Fight, Authorities Say102 A 44-year-old Jackson man was stabbed to death Thursday after trying to start a fight with a door-to-door salesman, authorities said. Michael Tsamas, the 32-year-old working for a company contracted by Verizon to solicit customers, has been charged with murder and two weapons offenses, the Ocean County Prosecutors Office said. The altercation took place shortly after the Tsmas knocked on Joseph Delgardios door, officials said. Delgardio told Tsmas he wasnt interested and the salesman left, according to the prosecutors office 103 Off-Duty Border Agent Rushed Into Uvalde School With Borrowed Shotgun to Save Students104 Jacob Alborado, who works as a Customs and Border Patrol CPB agent and lives in UvaldeTexas, got a chilling set of texts from his wife, a teacher at the now-famous Robb Elementary. He rushed to the scene and aided in the rescue of several rooms full of children, including his own daughter, Jayda. 105 Onlookers Urged Police to Charge Into Texas School106 UVALDE, Texas AP  Frustrated onlookers urged police officers to charge into the Texas elementary school where a gunmans rampage killed 19 children and two teachers, witnesses said Wednesday, as investigators worked to track the massacre that lasted upwards of 40 minutes and ended when the 18-year-old shooter was killed by a Border Patrol team. Go in there! Go in there! nearby women shouted at the officers soon after the attack began, said Juan Carranza, 24, who saw the scene from outside his house, across the street from Robb Elementary School in the close-knit town of Uvalde. Carranza said the officers did not go in. Javier Cazares, whose fourth grade daughter, Jacklyn Cazares, was killed in the attack, said he raced to the school when he heard about the shooting, arriving while police were still gathered outside the building. Upset that police were not moving in, he raised the idea of charging into the school with several other bystanders. Lets just rush in because the cops arent doing anything like they are supposed to, he said. More could have been done. They were unprepared, he added. Minutes earlier, Carranza had watched as Salvador Ramos crashed his truck into a ditch outside the school, grabbed his AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle and shot at two people outside a nearby funeral home who ran away uninjured 107 Probe Finds No Link Between New Jersey School and Possible Tumor Cluster108 An investigation into a possible brain cancer cluster found no evidence a New Jersey school was the cause of tumors diagnosed in former students, officials declared Thursday. During a press conference, local and state officials said a probe into Colonia High School, located in Woodbridge, found there was no cause and effect relationship between those illnesses and the building and grounds at Colonia High School. Today we are very happy to announce that our extensive testing for both radon and radiation in the interior and exterior of the school building produced no evidence of cancer-causing hazards that warrant further investigation, said Woodbridge Mayor John McCormac during the press conference posted on the townships Youtube page. This is terrific news for the current students of Colonia High School and their parents, who worried about their safety, along with current staff members, and is also great news for all former students who attended and staff who worked at Colonia High School. The investigation was jumpstarted after it was discovered more 122 people once connected to the school had a primary brain tumor and another 75 were diagnosed with other rare forms of cancer, according to NJ.com. 109 Prominent Journalists, Liberals Fall for Hoax Claiming Gov. Abbott Paid Uvalde Victims Families for Photo-Ops110 Left-wing activists and prominent journalists that write for liberal publications spread a hoax on Thursday that Texas Governor Greg Abbott paid the families of the Uvalde, Texas shooting massacre victims for photo ops. The shocking false claims came from the Twitter account MyCancerJourne3, which stated that following the Robb Elementary School mass shooting, a representative for Governor Abbott showed up to his residence and attempted to coerce his family. The post has since gone viral. 111 Rand Paul Elitists Want a One World Government Its Not a Conspiracy Theory112 Senator Rand Paul appeared on Fox News Thursday and discussed the ongoing World Economic Forum gathering in DavosSwitzerland, remarking that it is not a conspiracy theory to suggest the organisation is seeking a one world government, rather it is in their mission statement. Paul urged that The real danger here thats even more dangerous than all their phony caring about carbon footprint, the real danger is this look how bad your government is in a country where you get to vote for these people. This would be a government, a world government where you dont get to vote on anybody. This is everybodys worst nightmare, Paul asserted, referring to the penetration of the WEF, to quote its head Klaus Schwab, into national governments. 113 Shoplifting Suspect Arrested 108 Times After Stealing From New York Rite Aid Repeatedly114 42-year-old Michelle Mckelley has now been arrested for the 108th time for repeatedly stealing from a New York Rite Aid store. But since the arrests are under petit larceny, New York State law says such misdemeanor crimes arent eligible for monetary bail. Court officials have tried placing Mckelley under the care of the Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services CASES, but this alternative to jail hasnt stopped the suspect from habitual shoplifting. 115 Sussmann Lied About Clinton So FBI Wouldnt Dismiss Trump-Russia Tale Feds116 WASHINGTON  Former Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann lied to an FBI official because he knew the bureau would have been more skeptical of since-discredited allegations of a Donald Trump link to Russia had they known he was acting on behalf of the Clinton campaign and an internet executive, a federal prosecutor charged Friday. He knew he had to conceal his representation of the Clinton campaign and Rodney Joffe to push the Alfa-Bank allegations to the FBI, prosecutor Jonathan Algor told jurors in his closing argument in DC federal court. The chances of the FBI investigating would be diminished, would be seriously less if Sussmann had been up front with former FBI general counsel Jim Baker about his clients, Algor added. 117 Swiss Billionaire Behind Dem Dark Money Donations Despite Not Being US Citizen118 A Swiss octogenarian billionaire has donated tens of millions of dollars to Democratic politicians and progressive causes in dark money contributions  and Hansjörg Wyss is likely funneling millions more to influence midterm elections in November, sources say. One Virginia-based think tank estimates that, since 2016, nonprofits linked to Wyss have funneled more than 253 million to Democratic candidates and related causes, such as voter registration initiatives that benefit the party and efforts to impeach former President Donald Trump, through a dizzying array of related nonprofits. The foreign dark money revolving door is at it again, this time with their eyes set on the midterms, said Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the conservative Americans for Public Trust. Wyss has already funneled hundreds of millions through his nonprofits to liberal groups that influence our elections, and now those very same groups are poised to engage in every policy and political fight all the way until November. 119 TX Governor Livid After He Was Misled About Police Response in Uvalde Shooting120 Update 1705ET Texas Governor Greg Abbott R said he was misled about the police response to the school shooting in Udvalde, and is livid about what happened. 121 Universities Reinstate Mask Mandates Around the Country122 As the school year draws to an end, American universities around the country are reinstating mask mandates. The University of California Los Angeles sent out an email to its students on May 26, stating that its mask mandate will go back into effect beginning Friday, May 27 and remain in place through Wednesday, June 15. Not all students are on board with the policy change, however. We are already one of the strictest schools with COVID not only do we have to be vaccinated and boosted, but we also have to be tested weekly and fill out a symptom monitoring survey, said Stella Foreman, a freshman at the university. The University of Hawaii at Manoas website states, effective Wednesday, May 25, face masks are once again required indoors across the University of Hawaii System, except when working alone or separated from others by 6 feet or more. Regardless of how students may feel, more universities around the nation are following suit and implementing mask mandates again. 123 Watch Antifa, Gun-Control Activists Rage Outside NRA Convention, Call Black Police Officers Disgusting Pigs124 The National Rifle Association NRA Convention, which returned this year following a hiatus during the COVID pandemic, was met with anti-gun activists swarming the conventions Houston, Texas location on Friday in response to massacre at Robb Elementary School on Tuesday. 125 Biggest Fake News Story in Canada Kamloops Mass Grave Debunked by Academics126 One year ago today, the leaders of the British Columbia First Nation Band Tkemlúps te Secwpemc announced the discovery of a mass grave of more than 200 Indigenous children detected at a residential school in British Columbia.

The band called the discovery, Le Estcwicwy  or the missing. Whats still missing, however, according to a number of Canadian academics, is proof of the remains in the ground. Since last years announcement, there have been no excavations at Kamloops nor any dates set for any such work to commence. Nothing has been taken out of the ground so far, according to a Tkemlúps te Secwpemc spokesman. 127 Doctor Gave COVID-19 Shot to Hundreds of Kids as Young as Six Months Old128 A Toronto doctor is facing no professional discipline after admitting to giving the Covid-19 vaccine to at least 500 kids as young as six months old, despite the shot not being approved for children under the age of five.

While other truckers went east to Ottawa, these ones went south to protest for freedom. 131 Man Killed Near Toronto School Was Carrying Pellet Gun Police132 The Toronto Special Investigations United says that the man who was killed by police after bringing a firearm near a Toronto school on Thursday was carrying a pellet gun.

The decision comes into effect on June 1, and will apply to those who first fell under the mandate on Dec. 17. 135 Poilievre Says Supreme Court Decision to Allow Parole Opportunity for Quebec Shooter Violates Sense of Justice136 Conservative leadership frontrunner Pierre Poilievre released a statement on Friday condemning the Canadian Supreme Court over its decision to not allow a sentence of more than 25 years for the Quebec mosque shooter. Todays decision by the Supreme Court of Canada to reduce the sentence of Alexandre Bissonnette, who pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted murder for his attack on Muslim worshippers at the Islamic Cultural Centre in Quebec City on January 29, 2017, violates our sense of justice, wrote Poilievre. 137 Quebec Starts Vaccine Campaign Against Monkeypox138 Quebec has started its vaccine campaign against monkeypox, immunizing those who have been in close contact with the disease. The provinces interim public health director, Dr. Luc Boileau, said that the province now has 25 confirmed cases, with 30 suspected cases under investigation. 139 The World Economic Forum in Calgary? Likely in a City Near You as Well!140 There has been no lack of attention on the the World Economic Forum as of late, in large part thanks to the incredible work of our team of independent journalists in Davos, which you can find at WEFReports.com , and The Great Reset Docuseries from our very own Kian Simone, which you can watch at ExposeTheReset.com, but for many implications of the actions of the World Economic Forum still seem far off but are they? We are far beyond the absurd narrative that concerns over the WEF are conspiratorial, most of the alleged conspiracy theories out there are in fact direct quotes from Schwab himself, like his shocking admission that half of Trudeaus cabinet are WEF young global leaders, and that his organization intentionally penetrates foreign cabinets. For all the concern over foreign interference by certain politicians, this should be at the forefront of those conversations. Despite all of this, many are still relatively unworried about the WEFs activities. They believe that the aspirations of this group are far off pipedreams for some global movers and shakers, not locally influential realities but they are wrong. Personally founded by Klaus Schwab, The Global Shapers Community is a World Economic Forum initiative comprised of 500 hubs in 500 cities that bring together over 15,000 leading young adult advocates to focus on four pillars of activism which include Climate Action, Future Cities, Civic Life and Healthy Cities. 141 Trudeau Cancels Fancy Fundraiser Appearance Due to Protesters Wanting Freedom Back142 What was supposed to be an expensive in-person evening with the prime minister this past Tuesday quickly turned into guests paying 1,000 each to watch Justin Trudeau appear virtually for a few minutes instead. The fancy Liberal fundraiser advertised as An Evening with the RT.HON. Justin Trudeau took place at the Aria Convention Centre in Surrey B.C., where around 100 locals gathered outside to protest against the prime ministers scheduled appearance. 143 Breaking World Health Organization Fails to Stop Avi Yemini From Reporting144 We can film if we like the World Health Organization but if we are reporting badly on the World Health Organization, we cant film? independent journalist Savanah Hernandez, who is working with our Rebel News team, asked? The guard responded in the affirmative, uhmm hmmm. The team of six journalists Rebel News sent to Davos, Switzerland, to cover the annual cloister of the World Economic Forum made a six-hour detour on the way home through Geneva, to report on the 75th World Health Assembly, an event hosted by the World Health Organization. However, the team was not met with open arms and a vigorous defence of press freedoms upon their arrival 145 Dutch PM Sees Hope for Hungary Agreeing to Russian Oil Embargo146 Although Hungary is still resisting the sixth EU sanctions package against Russia, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has told CNBC in an interview that an agreement between other EU member states and Hungary on the proposed oil embargo could be reached by next week. While Rutte did not provide any details on how he envisioned such a compromise, the Politico news outlet has previously reported on the matter, citing an EU diplomat who suggested that pipeline oil transport would not be affected by the embargo, only imports by sea  this was one of Hungarys key requests. 147 EU Urges Citizens to Inform on Sanctions Violators148 The European Commission on Friday announced the introduction of an anonymous online platform for people to report any violations of sanctions on Russia and Belarus. Aware of anyone violating EU sanctions on Russia or Belarus? We have created an online tool for whistleblowers to contact us and report violations of EU sanctions, the EC tweeted. The commission also said on its website that sharing first-hand information can be a powerful tool to help uncover cases of violations, including evasion and circumvention. 149 European Union Preps for Gas Rationing Over Russian Shutdown Fears150 Gas rationing in Europe may be coming down the pike should Vladimir Putin follow through on his threat to cut off supplies to those who refuse to pay Russia in rubles, the European Unions energy commissioner has warned. This week, the EU has announced that it is crafting contingency plans, including rationing gas in the coming months in the event of a complete shut down of Russian gas shipments to the bloc. As many have already warned, a shortage of gas could be devastating to major European economies like Germany, which rely on abundant, cheap energy to function. 151 French Police Arrest ISIS-Supporting Teen Over Imminent Terror Attack152 French police in the department of Drôme have arrested an 18-year-old they claim was plotting to carry out a terrorist attack over the weekend and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State terror group.

At the farmers day in Alsfeld, association president Karsten Schmal said that the cost increases in the marketing chain would have to be passed on to consumers. They are caused by the exploding prices for energy, fuel, fertilizers and logistics. 155 Hungary Announces Fuel Restrictions on Foreigners156 The Hungarian government has announced that foreign drivers will no longer be allowed to gas up at reduced rates amid an explosive rise in prices and looming shortages in Europe.

buffalo,"Meet India Walton, the socialist who upset Buffalo 's longterm mayor in a stunning primary victory",2021-06-23T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Buffalo News,"While most eyes were on the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, there was a political awakening taking place in Buffalo, the Empire States second-largest city. India Walton, a self-proclaimed socialist and political newcomer, defeated four-term Mayor Byron Brown in the Democratic primary, according to the Associated Press3. Browns political defeat is a stunning loss for the longtime politician, a former state senator and former Democratic state party chairman who is a close ally of Gov. Andrew Cuomo. However, the loss represents the increasing strength of deeply progressive voters within the Democratic party, catapulting new faces4 into the levers of power across the country, from city council chambers to the halls of Congress. While Walton will also have to run in the November general election, the liberal tint of Buffalo puts her in an overwhelming position to win later this year. If successful, Walton, 38, will become the first socialist mayor of a large American city since Frank Zeidler of Milwaukee, who left office in 1960 after a 12-year reign. Here are some interesting things to know about Walton She grounded her candidacy with a strong grass-roots effort Walton is a former nurse and community activist who did not run with the backing of most establishment figures within the party. Brown chose not to debate5 Walton during the primary campaign and ran a more low-key campaign. In declaring victory, Walton noted6 that her campaign elevated the needs of residents over what she saw as business as usual. Tonights result proves that Buffalonians demand community-minded, people-focused government, and were ready to serve them, she said in a statement. For too long, weve seen our city work for politicians, for developers, for the police union, but not for ordinary working families. In our city, everyone will have a seat at the table. She said with exuberance during her Tuesday speech When we organize, we win. We deserve a government that works with and for us. Her campaign was decidedly progressive During the campaign, Walton called for an increase in funding for the citys public school system and an expansion of opportunities for home ownership, according to The Buffalo News7. Walton has also advocated for8 7.5 million in cuts to the Buffalo Police Department, by diverting funding away from the police for mental health calls and minor traffic enforcement responsibilities. Read more Governors of all 50 states are vaccinated against COVID-199 She hopes to direct the reallocated money to youth employment living-wage jobs, affordable housing, and public education improvements. We expect the police to respond to all of our societal ills that really are the result of these austerity budgets, where we cut social safety net services and mental health services, she tweeted last month10. Now the police are responding to everything from cars inappropriately parked in peoples driveways to mental health crises, and its just not a good use of their time or our taxpayer dollars. Waltons jubilant victory call to her mother was caught on video On election night, Walton rejoiced in her projected win11, a come-from-behind triumph that she was thrilled to share with her family. Mommy, I won. Mommy, Im the mayor of Buffalo. Well, not until January, but, yeah, Walton said to her mother via a phone call. Yes, Mom. I won. -Robert Kirkham RobertKirkhamBN June 23, 202112 Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, one of the most prominent progressive voices in the country, praised Walton on election night. India Walton became a mother at 14 years old, she tweeted13.

And Rod Watson hit another home run with a tongue-in-cheek column on state and county officials negotiating with the Billssuffering from the Stockholm syndrome6. Wrote Watson Bring in a hostage negotiating team to replace the public officials leading the talks. After all, the recent comments from a key National Football League team owner about the urgency of completing lease negotiations is just the latest example of how Western New Yorkers are being held captive to the whims of the team and its NFL co-conspirators.

The superintendent, in turn, has gotten snippy at times with board members during meetings. Theres now been new fuel added to the fire,a website just posted on the situation at McKinley16that places the blame on Cash and Marck Abraham, the now-departed principal he appointed to replace Crystal Boling-Barton after she was suspended.

buffalo,Buffalo not enforcing its fair housing law,2018-07-05T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Buffalo News,"Most people would have let it go. But Adkins knew that refusing to rent to somebody because they receive Section 8 is a violation of Buffalos fair housing law. She filed a complaint with Housing Opportunities Made Equal5, a local fair housing organization. HOMEs undercover testing showed that what happened to her wasnt a one-off, and passed these findings on to the citys fair housing officer. Almost two years later, Adkins is still waiting to hear back. Buffalos fair housing law6 was put in place to protect the thousands of city residents who rely on government assistance to pay their rent. But, in the 12 years since the law passed, the city has done little to enforce it, despite receiving at least 25 complaints like the one Adkins filed, most of them borne out by undercover testing - the gold standard in housing discrimination cases. In many cases, its unclear whether city officials even decided whether a landlord had violated the law. Those decisions, when they were made, were painfully slow. And even when a landlord was found to have discriminated, in most cases theres no indication that the city took any action against them. In Buffalo, one of the nations poorest cities, Section 8 is a lifeline for thousands of families. But an entire swath of the rental market is off limits to Section 8 tenants - not because they cant afford the rent, but because many landlords refuse to take their vouchers. The enforcement of this ordinance has been wholly insufficient and is a slap in the face to hardworking, lower-income families, said DeAnna Eason, HOMEs executive director. This demonstrates that fair housing is not a priority of this local government. Mayor Byron Brown said the city is very aggressive in pursuing fair housing cases, and that any cases that have not been resolved are pending. In fact, records show that city officials allowed many cases to sit, unresolved, for years - then argued they couldnt do anything because the statute of limitations had expired. Investigative Post was able to find only one case where the city took legal action against a landlord - and then only recently, after we began asking about the lack of enforcement. In most cases, city officials havent pursued out-of-court remedies, like bringing the parties together to work out a settlement, or making landlords take fair housing training, either. Case files have been lost. The position of fair housing officer has sat vacant for years at a time. A 2013 University at Buffalo study7 concluded that the law has been a failure on substantive grounds due to the lack of implementation. The citys inaction gives landlords who discriminate little incentive to obey the law. In one case, a landlord had a message on their answering machine No smoking and no Section 8. In another, a landlord emailed one of HOMEs testers, My ad on Craigslist states on the first line that I do not accept section 8 Good luck with your house hunt! Theres no record of the city taking action against either one. This story is based on a review of discrimination complaints referred to the city by HOME, emails and memos between city officials and fair housing advocates, and interviews with more than 30 people, including those who filed complaints and landlords who had complaints filed against them. Robert Dmochowski, whose wife owns the apartment Adkins looked at, said they dont discriminate against anyone. He wasnt sure if the case had been resolved, but said he hasnt heard anything from the city in over a year. Gloria Adkins filed a discrimination complaint with the city in 2016. It still hasnt been resolved. Photo by Joed Viera For Gloria Adkins, it wasnt just about this particular apartment, or this particular landlord. For her, Section 8 is a godsend. She remembers the relief she felt when she first received her voucher, after years on the waiting list. She was taken aback at how many landlords wouldnt accept it. For somebody to just decide, well, Im not going to deal with you because you have that program thats assisting you, its ridiculous, she said.Law decades in the makingIt took Buffalo almost four decades to pass a fair housing law. In the 1980s, fair housing legislation twice won support on the Common Council, only to be vetoed, both times, by Mayor James D. Griffin. At one tense public hearing, in 1989, angry homeowners kept interrupting the bills authors as they tried to explain it. By this point, fair housing had become the third rail of Buffalo politics and no one wanted to touch it, said Scott Gehl, HOMEs executive director for 35 years, until his retirement at the end of 2016. It was 17 years before the Common Council would revisit the issue, a few months into Browns first term as mayor. Even in 2006, when the law finally passed, it was only by one vote. North District Council Member Joseph Golombek denounced the proposed legislation as social engineering, telling The Buffalo News he feared this kind of law would deny property owners the right to choose their tenants. I dont want to be forced to rent to scumbags who might live down the street, he said.Stay informed Our weekly newsletter recaps our reporting and other must-read coverage of local issues. Delivered Sundays. In fact, nothing in the law prevents - or even discourages - landlords from screening tenants. An entire section of the law is dedicated to landlords rights. They can turn down anyone who cant afford the rent or whose neighbors have complained about them. They can check an applicants references, credit score and history of evictions. And, in a concession to smaller landlords, the law exempts owner-occupied doubles and triples, which make up a substantial portion of Buffalos housing stock. Buffalos fair housing ordinance goes further than state and federal law, which prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, and religion, among other categories, adding gender identity and lawful source of income - Section 8, Social Security Insurance benefits, housing assistance from the Erie County Department of Social Services. But this comes with a catch victims of source of income discrimination cant take their complaints to state or federal agencies. Until recently, they could only go to the city. In April, Erie County passed8 a fair housing law with similar source of income protections. Among those the law is meant to protect are the almost 9,000 households in Buffalo - almost 20,000 people - who depend on Section 8 to help pay their rent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Almost 40 percent are families with children. Another quarter are elderly. Sixty-five percent are African American, as are almost all the people whove filed discrimination complaints. Refusing to rent to Section 8 recipients is often a subtler way of refusing to rent to black people, advocates say.Examples of discriminationIn theory, Section 8 - officially the Housing Choice Voucher Program - allows recipients to live wherever they can afford the rent, giving them the chance to move out of distressed neighborhoods to places with more job opportunities, better schools and less crime. In reality, that choice is limited. Some neighborhoods are too expensive, even with a voucher. The average income of a Section 8 household is just 13,000 a year - less than half the city average. Voucher holders put roughly 30 percent of their monthly income towards the rent the subsidy covers the rest, up to a cap set by the federal government. Apartments have to pass an annual safety inspection working heat and hot water, no fraying electrical wires, no broken windows or rotting porch steps. Some landlords complain that the inspections require jumping through too many bureaucratic hoops, and that repairs are costly. There are benefits for landlords, though. Theyre guaranteed to receive the portion of rent covered by the subsidy every month, via direct deposit. And the program creates a safety net if a voucher holder loses their job, for instance, the rental assistance increases. Still, many landlords flatly refuse to take Section 8. Scrolling through rental listings online, a voucher holder will find dozens that tell her to keep looking no rental assistance, no pets, no Section 8! DOES NOT ACCEPT SECTION 8. Other landlords accept Section 8, but selectively, steering voucher holders to certain neighborhoods. At Kissling Interests, one of the citys biggest landlords, property managers said the companys two stately apartment buildings on Delaware Avenue, near Gates Circle, were not Section 8 approved, according to one complaint. Instead, they suggested a shabbier residential complex in a neighborhood where the poverty rate is almost twice as high. The case against Kissling is still unresolved through an attorney, the company declined to comment. Kissling Interests refused to accept Section 8 at this apartment building on Delaware Avenue. Photo by Joed Viera Instead, they suggested a more modest residential complex in a poorer neighborhood. Photo by Joed Viera The wait for a voucher lasts years. Demand for the program far outstrips the federal funding available. None of Buffalos Section 8 agencies is currently taking new applications. Once off the waiting list, new voucher holders have a window of time - up to 120 days, depending on the agency - to use the voucher, or risk losing it altogether. As rents rise, this is becoming more common. At Belmont Housing Resources for WNY9, one of the citys Section 8 agencies, almost a quarter of the people coming off the waiting list lost their vouchers last year - a sharp increase, managers say. Chastity Dean found herself in this position after a property management company refused to take her voucher at an apartment in South Buffalo. She had been turned down because of her Section 8 twice already, she told HOME. With time running out, all I wanted to do was get into that apartment and pretty much save my Belmont, she said, referring to her Section 8. Instead, she said, she lost her voucher. Its been more than three years since the city concluded that she had been discriminated against. In that time, the company she filed the complaint against has closed down. One of the final entries in her case file notes that, last summer, the fair housing officer said her complaint was still being worked on.Inept city bureaucracyMost of HOMEs case files tell a similar story a complaint is filed, substantiated by testing and sent to the city. Then, phone calls to city officials go unreturned, excuses are made, months pass, and the case fizzles out. Almost every step of the citys process for handling discrimination complaints has broken down at some point. Stack them all up and the pile of complaints isnt that large. Voucher holders and advocates say discrimination is pervasive, but it goes mostly unreported, national research shows. Between 2006, when the law went into effect, and the end of last year, the city received at least 25 complaints - roughly two a year. By the time the city receives a complaint, HOME has already done most of the investigative work. Its then up to the citys fair housing officer to determine whether theres probable cause that discrimination occurred. In 10 cases, the citys sloppy record keeping makes it unclear whether this ever happened. In response to a Freedom of Information request, the city provided records for just four complaints, none of them complete. Several cases were abandoned after the person who filed the complaint lost touch with HOME, or, in one instance, became homeless. Findings of discrimination, when they do come, take almost three times longer, on average, than the 120 days the law allows. If a landlord is found to have discriminated, the fair housing officer is supposed to bring the parties together for settlement talks. In many cases, theres no record of this happening, according to a review of HOMEs case files. One landlord told Investigative Post she settled her case for 20, with no requirement that she attend fair housing training - although she acknowledged that she hadnt known about the law. HOME, which filed the complaint after finding an ad she had posted on Craigslist, for a classy, comfy home saying sorry, no section 8 applicants accepted, was never informed of the settlement. If the landlord isnt willing to settle, the fair housing officer is supposed to send the complaint to the citys law department, which can take legal action seeking to impose fines or revoke rental licenses. In roughly a third of cases, the city has apparently failed to take action even after finding that a landlord has violated the law, HOMEs records show. This reluctance is all the more striking given that the city pays HOME to investigate discrimination complaints, spending scarce federal grant money on work that goes unused. Its very frustrating to tell folks that this is what the law says, but the citys not enforcing it, said Daniel Corbitt, HOMEs associate director and staff attorney. As more time goes by, theres less and less chance that folks will ever receive justice in a lot of these cases. Harold Cardwell, the citys fair housing officer since June 2015, says the complaint process works well. He disagreed that some cases never receive determinations, but refused to provide specifics. Andrew Cuomo and Eric Schneiderman, when they served as state Attorney General, took action10 against several landlords11 who turned Section 8 recipients away. The city, by contrast, has apparently taken legal action against a landlord only once, records and interviews show, and only after Investigative Post began making inquiries. In January 2016, Jackie Crouch was evicted from an apartment in South Buffalo after her landlords told her, via text message, that they would not fill out her Section 8 paperwork. The city took seven months to reach a finding of discrimination. Reached by phone, Richard Mazella, who owns the property with his wife, declined to comment, saying the complaint was bogus. After settlement talks fell apart last summer, Crouch didnt hear from the city for months. She wondered if filing the complaint had been worth it. Finally, in May, city attorneys filed a lawsuit against the Mazellas, seeking 4,500 in fines and a one-year suspension of their rental licenses. For victims of discrimination, the stakes are high, and when the city fails to act, they have few options. The law gives them the right to take legal action against a landlord independently, but going to court is costly and time-consuming. Only one case has so far been resolved this way. After University Property Management refused to take her voucher at an apartment in North Buffalo, Naima Stewart rushed to find somewhere else before she ran out of time, according to an affidavit filed in the case. The place shed wanted was close to the shops and restaurants of Hertel Avenue. Instead, she ended up in an apartment building on Lafayette Avenue, on the West Side, where the hallways smelled of sewage and were littered with used condoms, she said in the affidavit. The police were often called to the building on drug raids, sometimes breaking down apartment doors. She could hear sounds and fights related to prostitution through the thin apartment walls. In 2015, a state Supreme Court judge awarded Stewart almost 10,000 in damages. The city never decided whether she had been discriminated against.Shortcomings documentedIts not news to the Brown administration that the fair housing law has gone almost entirely unenforced. A 2012 report by HOME found inconsistent staffing of key positions related to fair housing. In 2013, a study by researchers at UB noted that no records of fines, civil penalties, or other enforcement actions have been maintained since the adoption of the ordinance. In 2014, the citys own federally required fair housing plan registered12 concerns that the law was mostlysymbolic and warned13 of limited funding, limited political will and a lack of coordination within and across various agencies The city has never filed the annual reports on its fair housing caseload that the law requires. A landlord training manual14 on the citys website doesnt mention the laws key provision. A link to a discrimination complaint form takes users15 to a HUD form, although federal law doesnt include source of income protections. Many landlords say they dont know about the law, and the city doesnt take advantage of obvious opportunities to educate them. The Department of Permit and Inspection Services is supposed to ensure that owners of apartment buildings certify that theyre fully aware of the law. A process to do so was never put in place, one city official said. The city requires smaller landlords to register their rental properties, but doesnt tell them about the fair housing law during the sign-up process, according to city officials and registered landlords. Cardwell, the fair housing officer, said he distributes copies of the law at the citys foreclosure auctions. Three years ago, frustrated at the citys inaction, fair housing advocates tried to make the case for enforcing the law in person, emails and memos show. But the first city attorney they met with, in June 2015, was reassigned, soon afterwards, to traffic court. A second attorney told them that November that hed been given the go-ahead to take legal action in one of the cases, but - after several months of confusion - they learned he had left to work for the Buffalo Board of Education. By the summer of 2016, city attorneys had bad news. Many of the complaints were now more than three years old too old to prosecute, they argued, because the statute of limitations had expired. The housing advocates were dismayed. The city had sat on these cases for years, and now the lawyers were saying it was too late to act on them. After setting new deadlines for the more recent cases, a third attorney assigned to work on fair housing left. Donmetria Campbell filed a complaint against Greenleaf .... in 2011, and city records show the fair housing officer found probable cause of discrimination. Greenleaf representatives denied the allegations in a meeting with the city, according to HOMEs case file. While the records show that the fair housing officer referred the case to the corporation counsels office, theres no indication the city took any formal enforcement action. After years of following up and waiting, Campbell stopped calling HOME to ask about her complaint, not wanting to be a nuisance. It wasnt the first time she had been turned down because of her voucher, and it wouldnt be the last. I could make 10 phone calls right now, she said, and at least six of them would come back and say, No Section 8.

buffalo,Economic Collapse Continues Uninterrupted,2021-04-24T00:00:00Z,Dissident Voice,WBFO,"The assault on economic science and coherence is intense. Working in concert, and contrary to the lived experience of millions of people, many newspapers are declaring miraculous economic growth rates for country after country. According to the rich and their media, numerous countries are experiencing or are on the cusp of experiencing very strong come-backs or complete recoveries. Very high rates of annual economic growth, generally not found in any prior period, are being floated regularly. The numbers defy common sense. In reality, economic and social problems are getting worse nationally and internationally. Getting back to the pre-Covid standard will take time, said1 Carmen Reinhart, the World Banks chief economist. The aftermath of Covid isnt going to reverse for a lot of countries. Far from it. _ftn1 Even this recent statement is misleading because it implies that pre-Covid economic conditions were somehow good or acceptable when things have actually been going downhill for decades. Most economies never really recovered from the economic collapse of 2008. Most countries are still running on gas fumes while poverty, unemployment, under-employment, inequality, debt, food insecurity, generalized anxiety, and other problems keep worsening. And today, with millions of people fully vaccinated and trillions of phantom dollars, euros, and yen printed by the worlds central banks, there is still no real and sustained stability, prosperity, security, or harmony. People everywhere are still anxious about the future. Pious statements from world leaders about fixing capitalism have done nothing to reverse the global economic decline that started years ago and was intensified by the COVID Pandemic. In the U.S. alone, in real numbers, about 3-4 million people a month have been laid off for 13 consecutive months. At no other time in U.S. history has such a calamity on this scale happened. This has improved slightly recently but the number of people being laid off every month remains extremely high and troubling. In New York State2, for example the statewide official unemployment rate remains the second highest in the country at just under 9. One year after the start of the pandemic and the recession it caused, most of the jobs New York lost still have not come back. emphasis added, April 2021._ftn2 In addition, nationally the number of long-term unemployed remains high3 and the labor force participation rate remains low4. And most new jobs that are created are not high-paying jobs with good benefits and security. The so-called Gig Economy has beleaguered millions. Some groups have been more adversely affected than others. In April 2021, U.S. News amp38 World Report conveyed that In February 2020, right before the coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, Black women had an employment to population ratio of 60.8 that now stands at 54.8, a drop of 6 percentage points. The obsolete U.S. economic system has discarded more than half a million black women from the labor force in the past year. In December 2019, around the time the COVID Pandemic began to emerge, Brookings reported5 that An estimated 53 million people44 percent of all U.S. workers ages 18-64are low-wage workers. Thats more than twice the number of people in the 10 most populous U.S. cities combined. Their median hourly wage is 10.22, and their median annual earnings are 17,950. _ftn5 The Federal Reserve reports6 that 37 percent of Americans in 2019 did not have 400 to cover an unanticipated emergency._ftn6 In Louisiana7 alone, 1 out of 5 families today are living at the poverty level. _ftn7Sadly, 60 of Americans will live below the official poverty line8 for at least one year of their lives. While American billionaires9 became 1.3 trillion richer, about 8 million Americans joined the ranks of the poor during the COVID Pandemic. And more inflation will make things worse for more people. A March 2021 headline from NBC News reads10 The price of food and gas is creeping higher  and will stay that way for a while. _ftn10 ABC News goes further in April 2021 and says11 that the post-pandemic economy will include higher prices, worse service, longer delays._ftn11 Homelessness in the U.S. is also increasing COVID-driven loss of jobs and employment income will cause the number of homeless workers to increase each year through 2023. Without large-scale, government employment programs the Pandemic Recession is projected12 to cause twice as much homelessness as the 2008 Great Recession. Over the next four years the current Pandemic Recession is projected to cause chronic homelessness to increase 49 percent in the United States, 68 percent in California and 86 percent in Los Angeles County. The homeless include the homeless on the streets, shelter residents and couch surfers. emphasis added, January 11, 2021 Perhaps ironically, just Two blocks from the Federal Reserve, a growing encampment of the homeless13 grips the economys most powerful person Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Officially, about four million businesses, including more than 110,000 restaurants, have permanently closed14 in the U.S. over the past 14 months. In April 2021 Business Insider stated15 that, roughly 80,000 stores are doomed to close in the next 5 years as the retail apocalypse continues to rip through America. The real figure is likely higher. Bankruptcies16 have also risen in some sectors. For example, bankruptcies by North American oil producers rose to the highest first-quarter level since 2016._ftn16 In March 2021 the Economic Policy Institute reported17 that more than 25 million workers are directly harmed by the COVID labor market. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are more than 100 applicants for each job opening in some sectors. Given the depth and breadth of the economic collapse in the U.S., it is no surprise that 1 in 6 Americans went into therapy18 for the first time in 2020. The number of people affected by depression, anxiety, addiction, and suicide worldwide as a direct result of the long depression is very high. These harsh facts and realities are also linked to more violence, killings, protests, demonstrations, social unrest, and riots worldwide. In terms of physical health19, Sixty-one percent of U.S. adults report undesired weight changes since the COVID-19 pandemic began. This will only exacerbate the diabetes pandemic that has been ravaging more countries every year. On another front, the Pew Research Center informs us20 that, as a result of the economic collapse that has unfolded over the past year, A majority of young adults in the U.S. live with their parents for the first time since the Great Depression. And it does not help that student debt21 now exceeds 1.7 trillion and is still climbing rapidly. _ftn21 Millions of college faculty have also suffered greatly over the past year. A recent survey22 by the American Association of University Professors AAUP found that real wages for full-time faculty decreased for the first time since the Great Recessionin 2008, and average wage growth for all ranks of full-time faculty was the lowest since the AAUP began tracking annual wage growth in 1972. After adjusting for inflation, real wages decreased at over two-thirds of colleges and universities. The number of full-time faculty decreased at over half of institutions. _ftn22 This does not account for the thousands of higher education adjuncts part-time faculty and staff that lost their jobs permanently. In April 2021, the Center on Budget amp38 Policy Priorities stated23 that, millions of people are still without their pre-pandemic income sources and are borrowing to get by. Specifically 54 million adults said they didnt use regular income sources like those received before the pandemic to meet their spending needs in the last seven days. 50 million used credit cards or loans to meet spending needs. 20 million borrowed from friends or family. These three groups overlap. _ftn23 Also in April 2021, the Washington Post wrote24 The pandemics disruption has created inescapable financial strain for many Americans. Nearly 2 of 5 of adults have postponed major financial decisions, from buying cars or houses to getting married or having children, due to the coronavirus crisis, according to a survey last week from Bankrate.com. Among younger adults, ages 18 to 34, some 59 percent said they had delayed a financial milestone. emphasis added According to Monthly Review25 The U.S. economy has seen a long-term decline in capacity utilization in manufacturing, which has averaged 78 percent from 1972 to 2019well below levels that stimulate net investment. emphasis added, January 1, 2021._ftn25 Capitalist firms will not invest in new ventures or projects when there is little or no profit to be made, which is why major owners of capital are engaged in even more stock market manipulation than ever before. Casino capitalism is intensifying. This, in turn, is giving rise to even larger stock market bubbles that will eventually burst and wreak even more havoc than previous stock market crashes. The inability to make profit through normal investment channels is also why major owners of capital are imposing more public-private partnerships PPPs on people and society through neoliberal state restructuring. Such pay-the-rich schemes further marginalize workers and exacerbate inequality, debt, and poverty. PPPs solve no problems and must be replaced by human-centered economic arrangements. The International Labor Organization estimates26 that the equivalent of 255 million full-time jobs have been lost globally as a result of government actions over the past 13-14 months. In March of this year, the Food and Agricultural Organization FAO of the United Nations reported27 that, Acute hunger is set to soar in over 20 countries in the coming months without urgent and scaled-up assistance. The FAO says, 8217The magnitude of suffering is alarming. And according to Reuters, Overall, global FDI Foreign Direct Investment had collapsed in 2020, falling by 42 to an estimated 859 billion, from 1.5 trillion in 2019, according to the UNCTAD report. UNCTAD stands for United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The international organization Oxfam tells28 us that The coronavirus pandemic has the potential to lead to an increase in inequality in almost every country at once, the first time this has happened since records began. Billionaire fortunes returned to their pre-pandemic highs in just nine months, while recovery for the worlds poorest people could take over a decade. emphasis added, January 25, 2021 According to the World Bank29, The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed about 120 million people into extreme poverty over the last year in mostly low- and middle-income countries. And despite the roll-out of vaccines in various countries the economic implications of the pandemic are deep and far-reaching. It is ushering in a new poor profile that is more urban, better educated, and reliant on informal sector work such as construction, relative to the existing global poor those living on less than 1.90day who are more rural and heavily reliant on agriculture. emphasis added Another source notes30 that Pew Research Center, using World Bank data, has estimated that the number of poor in India with income of 2 per day or less in purchasing power parity has more than doubled from 60 million to 134 million in just a year due to the pandemic-induced recession. This means, India is back in a situation to be called a country of mass poverty after 45 years. emphasis added_ftn31 In Europe, there is no end in sight to the economic decline that keeps unfolding. The United Kingdom, for example, experienced31 its worst economy in literally 300 years The economy in the U.K. contracted 9.9 percent in 2020, the worst year on record since 1709, the Office for National Statistics ONS said in a report on Friday Feb. 12. The overall economic drop in 2020 was more than double in 2009, when U.K. GDP declined 4.1 percent due to the worldwide financial crisis. Britain experienced the biggest annual decline among the G7 economies  France saw its economy decline 8.3 percent, Italy dropped 8.8 percent, Germany declined 5 percent and the U.S. contracted 3.5 percent. emphasis added_ftn32 Another source also notes32 that, The Eurozone is being haunted by ghost bankruptcies, with more than 200,000 firms across the European Unions four biggest nations under threat when Covid financial lifelines stop. In another sign of economic decline, this time in Asia, Argus Media reported33 in April 2021 that Japans 2020-21 crude steel output fell to a 52-year low._ftn34 Taken alone, on a country-by-country basis, these are not minor economic downturns, but when viewed as a collective cumulative global phenomenon, the consequences are more serious. It is a big problem when numerous economies decline simultaneously. The world is more interdependent and interconnected than ever. What happens in one region necessarily affects other regions. One could easily go country by country and region by region and document many tragic economic developments that are still unfolding and worsening. Argentina, Lebanon, Colombia, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, Jordan, South Africa, Nigeria, and dozens of other countries are all experiencing major economic setbacks and hardships that will take years to overcome and will negatively affect the economies of other countries in an increasingly interdependent world. And privatization schemes around the world are just making conditions worse for the majority of people. Far from solving any problems, neoliberalism has made everything worse for working people and society. It is too soon for capitalist ideologues to be euphoric about miraculous economic growth and success. There is no meaningful evidence to show that there is deep, significant, sustained economic growth on a broad scale. There is tremendous economic carnage and pain out there, and the scarring and consequences are going to linger for some time. No one believes that a big surge of well-paying jobs is right around the corner. Nor does anyone believe that more schemes to pay the rich under the banner of high ideals will improve things either. Relentless disinformation about the economy wont solve any problems or convince people that they are not experiencing what they are experiencing. Growing poverty, hunger, homelessness, unemployment, under-employment, debt, inequality, anxiety, and insecurity are real and painful. They require real solutions put forward by working people, not major owners of capital concerned only with maximizing private profit as fast as possible. The economy cannot improve and serve a pro-social aim and direction so long as those who produce societys wealth, workers, are disempowered and denied any control of the economy they run. Allowing major decisions to be made by a historically superfluous financial oligarchy is not the way forward. The rich and their representatives are unfit to rule and have no real solutions for the recurring crises caused by their outmoded system. They are focused mainly on depriving people of an outlook that opens the path of progress to society. There is no way for the massive wealth of society to be used to serve the general interests of society so long as the contradiction between the socialized nature of the economy and its continued domination by competing private interests remain unresolved. All we are left with are recurring economic crises that take a bigger and bigger toll on humanity. To add insult to injury, we are told that there is no alternative to this outdated system, and that the goal is to strive for inclusive capitalism, ethical capitalism, responsible capitalism, or some other oxymoron. But there is an alternative. Existing conditions do not have to be eternal or tolerated. History shows that conditions that favor the people can be established. The rich must be deprived of their ability to deprive the people of their rights, including the right to govern their own affairs and control the economy. The economy, government, nation-building, and society must be controlled and directed by the people themselves, free of the influence of narrow private interests determined to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone and everything else. The rich and their political and media representatives are under great pressure to distort social consciousness, undermine the human factor, and block progress. The necessity for change is for humanity to rise up and usher in a modern society that ensures prosperity, stability, and peace for all. It can be done and must be done._ftnref22_ftnref23_ftnref28 The post Economic Collapse Continues Uninterrupted34 first appeared on Dissident Voice35.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19 text612520of20Americans20Say20They20Gained20Weight20During20the20Pandemic,-Written20by20Meaganamp38textSixty2Done20percent20of20U.S.,consumption20are20all20contributing20factors.  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27 textThe20report27s20hunger20projections20are20based20on20the,Food20Crises20to20be20issued20in20April202021.  28 38utm_mediumemailamp38utm_campaignnewsletter_axiosmarketsamp38streambusiness  29  30  31  32  33  34  35","homeless, homelessness"
buffalo,Judge Rules Buffalo PD Shouldn't Have Fired Actual Good Cop Cariol Horne,2021-04-14T00:00:00Z,Wonkette,WBFO,"Gregory Kwiatkowski turned Neal Mack around and started choking him so then Im like, Greg! Youre choking him, because I thought whatever happened in the house he was still upset about so when he didnt stop choking him, I just grabbed his arm from around Neal Macks neck. That seemed reasonable, but Kwiatkowski punched her in the nose like a common Tom Buchanan.2 This required surgery, but Kwiatkowski considered himself the wounded party. He claimed she jumped on his back and struck him with her hands, obstructing his arrest. Kwiatkowski later filed a defamation suit against Horne for 65,000, which he won. He only collected 20,000, though. Buffalos not that racist.Horne was fired from the Buffalo PD in 2008, just a few months before she could receive her pension. Shed served on the force for 19 years, but it was determined shed put her fellow officers in danger when she tried to prevent Kwiatkowski from strangling a suspect. Kwiatkowski was promoted to lieutenant later that year.Oh, FUCK THE POLICE! Sorry, I really intended for this to be more good cop than actual cop story. embedded content This is what happens to good cops. Last year, a Springfield, Massachusetts, detective was fired3 for expressing mild support online for Black Lives Matter. Youll notice that most self-proclaimed good cops never seem to know any bad cops. Theyll also swear theyve never witnessed police brutality or racial discrimination on the job. They all work in Mayberry, apparently. Even if a cop isnt inclined to grotesque violence like Kwiatkowski or Derek Chauvin, theres no incentive to speak out or dare stop them. The police union is more protective of killer cops than selfless ones like Horne. Dr. Martin Luther King once said, The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. While I dont always agree, Im pleased to report that Horne finally received some justice4 Tuesday. A state judge vacated an earlier ruling that had affirmed her termination. Shell now receive her pension, benefits, and back pay. From the New York Times5 The legal system can at the very least be a mechanism to help justice prevail, even if belatedly, the judge, Justice Dennis E. Ward, wrote. His ruling also invoked the deaths of Mr. Floyd and Eric Garner6, a Black man from Staten Island whose dying words  I cant breathe  have become a national rallying cry against police brutality7.I cant breathe are relevant and potent words here, because Horne was moved to act in 2006 when she heard Mack say he couldnt breathe. Kwiatkowski reportedly punched a handcuffed Neal in the face repeatedly before putting him in a chokehold. This is who the Buffalo PD promoted. The time is always right to do right, added Justice Ward, of State Supreme Court in Erie County, paraphrasing the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Although Horne mightve saved Neals life that night, Kwiatkowski remained a well-compensated public threat. In 2012, he was indicted, and in 2018 he was sentenced to four months in prison on federal civil rights charges resulting from the 2009 arrest of four Black teens. Calling them savage dogs, Kwiatkowski beat the kids senseless. He grabbed one of the handcuffed teens by the neck and slammed him headfirst into a police car. He did the same to the others, one by one. These hardened criminals were suspects in a drive-by BB gun shooting.Last September, the city of Buffalo approved Cariols Law,8 which requires that officers step in if they believe another officers using excessive force on a suspect. It says something that the police need a whole separate law reminding them that they should stop all crimes in progress, including the ones fellow cops are committing. I do think Cariols Law sounds better than the Party Pooper Law, which is what I imagine most Buffalo cops call the law at home. There are also whistleblower protections, which should encourage more cops to do the right thing. However, a tremendous culture change is needed. Police in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, literally flew their own thin blue line flag9, as if they protect and serve a separate cop nation. In a statement, Ms. Horne, 53, celebrated the decision. My vindication comes at a 15-year cost, but what has been gained could not be measured, she saidAfter she was fired, Horne worked odd jobs, mostly recently as a truck driver. Shes even lived out of her car, which means she was homeless. The moral arc might bend toward justice but too many lives are broken along the way. The Buffalo Police might not have deserved Horne, but Buffalo citizens needed this legitimately good cop. embedded content The New York Times10  Buffalo News11Follow Stephen Robinson on Twitter.12Looking for someone to give that cash to?

buffalo,New York City Council votes to prohibit businesses from using facial recognition without public notice,2020-12-10T00:00:00Z,VentureBeat,WGRZ,"In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, an increasing number of cities and states have expressed concerns about facial recognition technology and its applications. Oakland and San Francisco, California and Somerville, Massachusetts are among the metros where law enforcement is prohibited from using facial recognition. In Illinois, companies must get consent before collecting biometric information of any kind, including face images. New York recently passed2 a moratorium on the use of biometric identification in schools until 2022, and lawmakers in Massachusetts have advanced a suspension3 of government use of any biometric surveillance system within the commonwealth. More recently, Portland, Maine approved a ballot initiative banning the use of facial recognition by police and city agencies. The New York City Council bill, which was sponsored by Bronx Councilman Ritchie Torre, doesnt outright ban the use of facial recognition technologies by businesses. However, it does impose restrictions on the ways brick-and-mortar locations like retailers, which might use facial recognition to prevent theft or personalize certain services, can deploy it. Businesses that fail to post a warning about collecting biometric data must pay 500. Businesses found selling data will face fines of 5,000. In this aspect, the bill falls short of Portland, Oregons recently-passed ordinance regarding biometric data collection, which bans all private use of biometric data in places of public accommodation, including stores, banks, restaurants, public transit stations, homeless shelters, doctors offices, rental properties, retirement homes, and a variety of other types of businesses excepting workplaces_. Its scheduled to take effect starting January 1, 2021. I commend the City Council for protecting New Yorkers from facial recognition and other biometric tracking. No one should have to risk being profiled by a racist algorithm just for buying milk at the neighborhood store, Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, said. While this is just a first step towards comprehensively banning biometric surveillance, its a crucial one. We shouldnt allow giant companies to sell our biometric data simply because we want to buy necessities. Far too many companies use biometric surveillance systems to profile customers of color, even though they are biased. If companies dont comply with the new law, we have a simple message well see you in court. Numerous studies and VentureBeats ownanalyses4of public benchmark data have shown facial recognition algorithms are susceptible to bias. One issue is that the data sets used to train the algorithms skew white and male. IBMfound5that 81 of people in the three face-image collections most widely cited in academic studies have lighter-colored skin. Academics have found that photographic technology and techniques can also favor lighter skin, including everything from sepia-tinged film to low-contrast digital cameras. The algorithms are often misused in the field, as well, which tends to amplify their underlying biases. Areport6from Georgetown Laws Center on Privacy and Technology details how police feed facial recognition software flawed data, including composite sketches and pictures of celebrities who share physical features with suspects. The New York Police Department and othersreportedly7edit photos with blur effects and 3D modelers to make them more conducive to algorithmic face searches. Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft have self-imposed moratoriums on the sale of facial recognition systems. But some vendors, like Rank One Computing and Los Angeles-based TrueFace, are aiming to fill the gap with customers, including the City of Detroit and the U.S. Air Force.  1 38utm_mediumnov-19-sidebaramp38utm_contenttext-linkamp38utm_campaigndec-10-logmein-webinar  2  3  4  5  6  7",homeless

buffalo,How a stadium can benefit the community,2022-01-26T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WGRZ,"Before the NBAs Los Angeles Clippers5 broke ground last summer on a new arena, the teams owners, elected officials and civic groups made certain the 1.8 billion project would benefit the entire community. In September 2020, the parties signed a community benefits agreement6, or CBA, that outlined who would get jobs and contracts during and after construction, how much those jobs would pay, what the project would look like, and how the city and its residents would share in the profits generated by the new arena. The Clippers also committed 100 million to fund housing, education and other social and infrastructure improvement programs identified by community groups and elected officials. Other cities negotiating the construction of new sports arenas have used CBAs, too. The Atlanta Falcons earmarked 40 million for parks and a job training center7, among other programs. A coalition of community groups got the Pittsburgh Penguins to pay for a new grocery store8 in a largely African-American community that lacked one. The Milwaukee Bucks agreed to hire at least half the workers at their new arena from the citys poorest neighborhoods and pay them a living wage9. A CBA is a legally binding agreement between developers and community groups that ensures projects receiving public dollars will improve local neighborhoods and the lives of local residents, according to Andrea Súilleabhin, executive director of Partnership for the Public Good10, a Buffalo-based think tank. Really at the core is this principle that for public investment, or public subsidies, surrounding communities should see community benefits return to them, Súilleabhin said. More than 350 such agreements have been won by community groups and lawmakers across the country over the past 20 years, according to John Goldstein11, who has advised numerous CBA campaigns, including two here in Buffalo. Donate to support our nonprofit newsroom12 The CBA movement was born in Los Angeles in the late 1990s, Goldstein told Investigative Post, then quickly spread to big cities like New York, Chicago and Atlanta, as well as mid-sized cities such as Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and Nashville, to name just a few. Many CBAs, though not all, have been attached to professional sports arenas and the entertainment districts built around them. There are almost always significant public investments in such projects, Goldstein said, in the form of tax abatements, grants of public money or land, or infrastructure work That means that we, the public, are investors in the project, he said. And so we are entitled to be part of the team negotiating the deal. Thus far, the negotiations for construction of a new Buffalo Bills stadium have unfolded behind closed doors13, between state and county officials and the teams owners, with virtually no public insight or input. Nor can the CBA movement claim any clear victories in Western New York. Súilleabhin hopes that will change when a proposal comes out of the negotiating room and is sent to Erie County and New York state legislators for approval. She said a coalition has formed to promote a CBA proposal, which is being championed by State Senator Sean Ryan and Erie County Legislature Chair April Baskin. In an interview with the local podcast The Square14 last month, Ryan called public subsidies for professional sports arenas a small tragedy, given that stadiums provide virtually zero economic benefit to a community once theyre built. Why in the world are taxpayers paying for stadiums? Ryan said, adding that a CBA was the best way to ensure the public received some return on its investment. CBAs across the country The first CBAs were driven by labor unions, according to Goldstein, who became involved with the movement as a labor organizer in Milwaukee. In recent years, he said, CBAs have expanded to address broader community needs, such as affordable housing, education and health equity. This is not just, you know, labor unions thinking about how theyre going to get more jobs, he said. Its also engaging the community in a very real way to address important community needs. The Clippers CBA included benchmarks for local hiring and contracting, engaging minority- and women-owned businesses, and paying a living wage to workers during and after construction  the baseline considerations typical of most CBAs. Follow us on Facebook15, Twitter16 and YouTube17 On top of that, the Clippers - who began play as the Buffalo Braves18 between 1970 and 1978 - committed 100 million to address some of Inglewoods most pressing needs, including 75 million to start a revolving loan fund to support affordable housing projects. 12.25 million for college scholarships, tutoring, counseling and other educational programs. 6 million to improve the citys public library and build a new community center. 3 million in rental and legal assistance for people struggling to avoid eviction. 2.5 million to aid first-time homebuyers. Three-quarters of that money will seed a revolving loan fund for affordable housing projects. The rest will pay for educational programs and college scholarships, build a new library and community center, and provide assistance for renters facing eviction and aid to first-time homebuyers, among other initiatives. Among the first CBAs was a 2001 agreement19 reached between a coalition of community groups and the developers of an entertainment district surrounding the Staples Center in Los Angeles. That arena continues to host the Clippers and Lakers of the NBA and the Kings of the National Hockey League. In exchange for 150 million in public subsidies, the developers agreed that at least 70 percent of the jobs created by the project would pay a living wage. They committed to a first source hiring program, ensuring job opportunities would be offered to local, low-income communities, including those displaced by the project. The agreement also included an affordable housing component, as well as commitments to using local contractors and leasing commercial space to local businesses. Further, the developers agreed to fund a study of the surrounding communitys parks and recreation facilities and commit 1 million to improving them. Agreements in mid-sized cities Súilleabhin described some benefits other municipalities have won as examples of what Western New York taxpayers might seek in negotiations with the Bills In 2005, an alliance of San Diego community groups negotiated a CBA with the developers of Ballpark Village, a 7-acre development around the citys Major League Baseball stadium thats home to the Padres. The developers committed to environmentally friendly design standards and building practices, in addition to baseline demands for local hiring and living-wage jobs. In 2008, when the Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL wanted to build a new arena, a coalition of more than 100 community groups won 8.3 million in funding for neighborhood projects, including a grocery store  an amenity the largely African-American Hill District lacked. In 2016, the Milwaukee Bucks signed a CBA for a new arena that included living wage and local hiring guarantees that extended past the construction period to cover the service and retail jobs the project would create over the long term. In 2017, the Atlanta Falcons opened a new 1.5 billion stadium. The teams owner avoided a legally binding CBA but agreed to invest more than 40 million in parks, a job center, housing and social programs. In 2018, Nashville officials agreed to pay for a 275 million stadium for the citys new Major League Soccer team with a CBA that provides for affordable housing and a childcare facility on the development site, as well as retail spaces for local artisans and small businesses at a reduced rental rate. All those projects involved public subsidies. And then theres the Clippers CBA. The Clippers sought little in the way of public money. The project is privately owned and, for the most part, privately financed. Súilleabhin noted that the CBA was finalized as the first wave of the COVID pandemic underlined the fragility of at-risk populations who deal disproportionately with poor access to healthcare, quality housing and educational opportunities. She said it should provide a template for a CBA with the Bills, who expect significant subsidies for a new stadium in Orchard Park20. If were going to put public money into what is essentially a leisure activity that requires some discretionary income to enjoy, then we also need to make some commitments to help people who are struggling, Súilleabhin said.

What You Are, Are Creatures of Big Tech. Rudy Giuliani on Big Media and Big Tech Censorship Video86 Rudy Giuliani gave another amazing presentation about Big Tech and Big Media censorship. These people are not Americans because Americans cherish free speech. Rudy Giuliani says at the 814 mark in the video below87 AOC Demands Federal Funding to Deradicalize White Supremacists, Conspiracy Theorists88 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-NY on Friday called for the federal government to better fund efforts to deradicalize white supremacists, conspiracy theory adherents, and others who have supposedly been misled by President Donald Trump.89 Are You Getting it Yet? They Dont Want You to be Free!90 People who understand what is going on know the value of liberty. And yet, the governments message is loud and clear they do not want you to be free. They demand and desire only your enslavement. In an incredible video on High Impact Flix, creator Brian details the ways the government has removed the illusion of choice and freedom lately. If you dont have freedom, you dont have anything, Brian says. If you havent figured out that the United States government has taken more of your rights and freedom than any other entity ever because you believed they have the authoritypower to do so, this is going to be a rough year for you. The tyrannical veil has been lifted and its time we all wake up.91 As Tech Companies Purge Users, Here Are Some Alternatives92 By Simon Black at Sovereign Man By now youre probably aware of the various purges taking place across tech platforms and social media. Major companies have used the events of January 6th at the US Capitol as an excuse to delete users and deplatform businesses. But the scope of the purge has gone much further than removing calls for violence. For example, 147 members of Congress are being blacklisted by banks, insurance providers, and hotel companies because they objected to certifying the results of the election. The entire social media company Parler was shut down when Amazon banned it from its servers, while Apple and Google dropped the app from their stores. Twitter executed over 70,000 accounts. PayPal cut ties with the US President, as well as a Christian website that raised funds to send protesters to DC. Shopify removed accounts associated with Trump, and payment processor Stripe joined in the purge as well. Facebook even suspended Ron Pauls account for a time, before claiming it was a mistake. Ron Paul, keep in mind, has been an outspoken critic of this administrations defense and monetary policies. The message is clear your access, your data, and potentially your livelihood is not safe in the hands of the biggest tech companies, which we have been conditioned to rely on. Express the wrong opinion, and you may be the next casualty. What this means The good news is there are alternatives, and the purge has been a major driving force for people to move to alternative platforms.93 Biden to Reimpose COVID-19 Travel Ban on Europe and Brazil94 President Trump on Monday lifted a COVID-19 travel ban on Brazil and much of Europe but President-elect Joe Bidens incoming press secretary vowed to reverse the move.

While at Harvard as the president of the Black Students Association, she explained her views on race science Please use the following theories and observations to assist you in your search for truth regarding the genetic differences between Blacks and whites, Clarke wrote. One Dr Richard King reveals that the core of the human brain is the locus coeruleus, which is a structure that is Black, because it contains large amounts of neuro-melanin, which is essential for its operation. Two Black infants sit, crawl and walk sooner than whites. Three Carol Barnes notes that human mental processes are controlled by melanin that same chemical which gives Blacks their superior physical and mental abilities.103 California Shelves Batch of Moderna Vaccines Over Allergy Concerns104 California health officials are calling on COVID-19 vaccine providers to stop using a batch of Modernas shots after a handful of people who were inoculated at the same site all had allergic reactions.

I drafted it in December and things have only gotten worse, state Rep. Tom Kading, R-N.D., the lead sponsor of his states bill, told Fox amp38 Friends on Saturday. Im frankly shocked at whats happening to our country and censoring does not create unity, it does not help the situation of division in our country, and it does not de-escalate the situation, Kading said. All it really does is make those who have been silenced dig in deeper and be more suspicious of whats going on.129 Lobby Group Sues Apple to Remove Telegram From App Store for Allowing Hate Speech130 A lobbyist group is suing Apple in an effort to get free speech messaging platform Telegram removed from the app store, claiming that it allows extremists to spread hate speech. Telegram has seen a surge in users since Twitter and Facebook permanently suspended President Trump. Last week the service gained more than 25 million new users in just 72 hours, taking the total users to over 500 million. The platform promotes itself as a service that believes in free speech and a strong privacy ethic, often polarising itself from the likes of Facebook owned Watts App and Microsoft owned Skype.

We have to quickly dispense with the notion that Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon, and Apple are private entities that can do what they want. They represent the power of the state and their conduct is therefore in violation of the First Amendment. Big Tech companies, said conservative attorney Mark Fitzgibbons on an edition of Americas Survival TV, have assumed the role of state actors. This means they are doing the bidding of Congressional Democrats such as Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. Led by Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, left-wing politicians have, in effect, pressured Big Tech into helping the government regulate political speech. In the Wall Street Journal article, Save the Constitution from Big Tech, Vivek Ramaswamy and Jed Rubenfeld argue that, Using a combination of statutory inducements and regulatory threats, Congress has co-opted Silicon Valley to do through the back door what government cannot directly accomplish under the Constitution. Ramaswamy says, Weve gone from a 3-branch government to one with a branch office in Silicon Valley. The right answer is to open channels of dialogue, not close them. But massive censorship is now underway, violating the First Amendment rights of the American people. The practice is also known as government censorship by proxy, in the words of the officer of a competitor, Parler, which went off-line because of actions by other Big tech companies.149 Trump Plans Elaborate Farewell Event at Joint Base Andrews150 President Trump is planning a final farewell event on Wednesday at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland preceding President-elect Joe Bidens inauguration in Washington, D.C.151 Trumps 1776 Commission Slams Destructive Scholarship In Final Report152 President Trumps 1776 Commission, formed to promote patriotic education, on Monday released a final report touted by the White House as offering a definitive chronicle of the American founding. The 45-page report slams destructive scholarship that it says misrepresents the history of slavery and racial discrimination. States and school districts should reject any curriculum that promotes one-sided partisan opinions, activist propaganda, or factional ideologies that demean Americas heritage, dishonor our heroes, or deny our principles, the report says.153 Twitter Exec Says Company Taking Crackdown on Conspiracy Theorists Global154 Footage released Monday shows a top Twitter executive discussing the companys recent crackdown on accounts that push conspiracy theories, calling it a global initiative.

It is a shock that she ever was named to that position and rumored that she was put there by former Speaker Paul Ryan to continue the Deep State Republicans harassment of President Trump. Last week Liz Cheney voted to impeach President Trump, without due process, on bogus charges, based on lies that he started a riot at the Capitol on January 6th. Liz announced her decision on House Conference Chair stationary.161 YouTube Removes Live Stream of Peaceful Virginia Gun Rights Rally162 On Monday, YouTube cut independent news outlet Status Coup News live coverage of a peaceful gun rights rally in Virginia mid-stream and accused the outlet of violating YouTubes firearms policy. Status Coup News was covering the annual Lobby Day rally, which is organized by Virginias top gun-rights group, Virginia Citizens Defense League VCDL. VCDL describes Lobby Day as an event where normal, everyday Americans go to the Virginia Capitol to tell our state legislators to SAY NO TO GUN CONTROL. Status Coup News live coverage of the rally documented the event and featured interviews with several of its attendees. But according to YouTube, this coverage violated the platforms firearms policy because YouTube does not allow live streams showing someone holding, handling, or transporting a firearm.163 I Make People Healthy. I Am Essential Ottawa Gym Owner Gives Update After Repeated Fines164 You may recall the story of Zach Boissinot, the owner of A Foot Above Fitness located in Orlans, Ont. Back in October, he received several hundred dollars in fines for having the temerity to open his gym. Alas, in Doug Fords Ontario, breaking a sweat to improve ones physical and even mental acumen is verboten. Premier Ontario NOT Open for Business Ford would much rather citizens stay home and bake cherry cheesecake which will surely help in the fight against such ailments as obesity, diabetes, etc.. Zach was one of our first Canadian I Will Open cases. But alas, bylaw has been relentless. They continue to visit A Foot Above Fitness and fine Zach for the crime of providing a service that his clients so desperately want. Much like Adam Skelly of Adamson Barbecue, it seems as if the authorities want to make an example of Mr. Boissinot.165 Sneak Preview Toronto Cops Grab, Tackle, Arrest Protesters166 As they have done every weekend since late in April of 2020, the protesters of Yahoo Nation gathered in opposition of Ontarios COVID-19 restrictions, this time demonstrating against the provinces move into a second state of emergency. Although police have given some of the organizers and speakers a hard time with tickets, things had largely remained peaceful as the crowd regularly showed support to the uniformed officers as they watched over the rallies each weekend. This past Saturday, however, things drastically changed. Police blocked off Yonge-Dundas Square with a large presence, while the attendees attempted to carry on with their protest. After police warned the crowd to disperse, officers began arresting some of those in attendance.167 World Champion Martial Artist Charged for Speaking at Quebec Lockdown Protest168 Dave Leduc is a multiple time world champion in the Burmese martial art of Lethwei, also known as Burmese boxing. Its a full contact combat sport that involves headbutting, and is done bareknuckle. Leduc knows about fitness, health and weighing risks. Hes a world-class athlete at the peak of his career, not someone with triple comorbidities who needs to be confined to their home for their own safety from the coronavirus. Leduc also knows about freedom, having competed in places like the UAE and other more oppressive parts of the world. Thats why hes been vocal about his opposition to the pandemic lockdown in his home province of Quebec.169 European Commissions Slap in the Face for Europes Indigenous Minorities170 In another sign of disregard for Europes indigenous minorities, the European Commission has rejected the recommendations of the Minority Safepack initiative MSPI, that was designed to safeguard the rights of people who are indigenous to Europe, but for historic reasons are members of linguistic, national or religious minorities in their own countries. The initiative was started by the Federal Union of European Nationalities FUEN that has more than 100 member organizations in 35 European countries, and is the largest European umbrella organization of autochthonous, national minorities in Europe. The main impetus for the initiative had originated in long-standing grievances of some ethnic groups living within European Union member states, as well as EU candidate countries.

Appealing to centrist so-called constructors who could replace IV, the premier called for the limpid backing of liberals, popular party members and socialists. Conte said former premier Renzi whom he blamed for a grave act of irresponsibility had opened a crisis that must find in this forum its clarification with transparency with respect to the clear action which marked my mandate. Conte is seeking enough so-called constructors to replace IV crucially in the Senate where he no longer has a majority and where he will face the second of the two confidence votes on Tuesday. We need the widest possible consensus among willing forces, Conte said as he addressed the possible constructors who could save his executive. Conte said the crisis had dissipated energies in sterile polemics that it was without any foundation, and that the government had improved the COVID Recovery Plan which Renzi had cited as the reason for his defection. He said the use of the European Stability Mechanism for health spending doesnt come into it. The premier said the crisis had damaged the country, and what has happened cannot be cancelled, effectively rebuffing Renzis tentative overtures to do a U-turn and return to the administration he brought down. Conte said Italy deserves a cohesive government and called on lawmakers to now help it turn the page. He said the Recovery Plan would be a collective and shared effort. Conte said that his aim was to continue to bring about reform, From the start I worked for the creation of the prospect of a board, courageous design for a new season of reform based on sustainability, social and territorial cohesion and the full development of the human person, Conte said as he appealed to the lawmakers to back his executive, That vision is still present today. The premier also said the government would promoted a proportional electoral system, appealing to lawmakers in the small centrist groups he needs to replace IV. He also said he would reinforce the government team and would serve put the rest of the legislative term which ends in 2023. We will build a government that is open to those who hold dear the countrys state and fate, said the PM. Conte is appealing to parliament to keep his government alive after IV party triggered the crisis by pulling its support last week. The premier faces the first of two crunch confidence votes in the lower chamber, with an even stiffer test coming in the Senate on Tuesday if his executive survives in the House on Monday. He is set to appeal to so-called constructor lawmakers from outside the ruling coalition to vote for the government and stop it collapsing in the middle of the COVID-10 pandemic. The two senior partners in the ruling coalition, the 5-Star Movement M5S and the centre-left Democratic Party PD, have already rejected the idea of patching things up with ex-premier Renzi. But the PD has kept the door open to individual IV lawmakers and two have said that they will break ranks from the centrist group. The centre-right opposition has called for snap elections, arguing that, even if the government survives the confidence votes, if will be too weak to effectively rule the country. Life Senator and Holocaust survivor Liliana Segre said she will defy medical advice and will be in Rome to vote for the government, describing the crisis as incomprehensible.181 Kaczynski Appeals for Rejection of Evil Attacking Poland182 Ruling Law and Justice PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, while speaking at a church in Starachowice in southern Poland, warned those gathered that an evil is attacking Poland and the Church. Kaczynski made the remarks during a mass commemorating the 8th anniversary of the death of his mother, who was born in the same town as the church where he was speaking. He drew attention to all those in the town who in the past had through their work and activities rejected evil. He said that it was no accident that he was reminding parishioners about the evil once again attacking our country, fatherland and nation, as well as the institution which is at the center of our identity the Catholic Church.183 Orban and Macron Are the New European Axis184 Despite all appearances to the contrary, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and French President Emmanuel Macron share many views and policies, Swedish economist and author Fredrik Erixon writes in The Spectator in an opinion piece entitled Orban and Macron, Europes new power couple. Erixon writes that in a Europe characterized by the waning power of Merkel and consequently that of Germany that Macron has, in Orban, found himself an ally who is far more influential than people give him credit for. Macron and Orban arent political twins. But Macron, perhaps sensing which way the wind is blowing, has come a long way since 2017, when he was saluted as the antidote to the nationalism of Brexit and Donald Trump, Erixon writes. Just as Orban and his Fidesz party turned their backs on their founding liberalism and identity of youthful revolt, there isnt much liberalism left in Macron.185 Over 50,000 Restaurants in Italy Declare I Am Open Defying Lockdown Measures186 Via 21stCenturyWire.com, This weekend, over 50,000 restaurants in Italy began defying the countrys strict anti-Covid lockdown measures in a massive act of civil disobedience according to Off-Guardian.

The Sunday Times reports that COVID lockdown officials are looking to mirror policies introduced in New Zealand, where all new arrivals to the country are forced to check in to a quarantine hotel at the airport for a period of 2 weeks. Another potential enforcement measure would be to copy Polands so-called enhanced monitoring system for those who are supposed to be self-isolating.191 UK Liberal Democrats to Campaign to Bring Back EU Free Movement192 The leader of the Liberal Democrats, which branded the Leave vote a national humiliation, is campaigning to bring back freedom of movement with the EU, opening up migration to an unlimited number of Europeans to live and work in the UK.

Distressing details of the aftermath of the 2017 radical Islamic terror attack reveal that Saffie was not killed instantly when suicide bomber Salman Abedi, who had been ferried to Britain from Libya by the Royal Navy in 2014, triggered his bomb, as was previously believed, but remained conscious for over an hour, and may have survived her injuries if she had received adequate medical attention.199 UK Khans London Up to Forty Males Fight Street Battle With Swords, Knives, Broken Bottles200 A mob of up to 40 males fought a running battle on the streets of London with swords, knives, and broken bottles, despite Englands draconian anti-coronavirus lockdown.

Relatives left the village on October 29, while Tovmasyan stayed behind. Azeri forces later captured the village and following the ceasefire agreement she was reported missing. When Tovmasyans body was discovered, it had been mutilated nearly beyond recognition. Her brother Samvel only recognized her by her clothing. Relatives also reported that Tomasyans feet, hands and ears had been cut off as part of her torture. These types of atrocities are reminiscent of those committed during previous pogroms and genocides against the Armenian Christian community. Tomasyan is one of many Armenians who were killed needlessly at the hands of Azeri forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Azerbaijans dehumanization of Armenian Christians is also influenced by Turkey. It is a combination which builds concern for the remaining Armenian Christian community in Nagorno-Karabakh.219 Pakistan Wants to Prosecute Online Blasphemy Committed Abroad220 Pakistan is threatening to prosecute non-Pakistanis in foreign countries for breaking its blasphemy laws online. The country, which is no stranger to censorship, seems to be copying China, which also tries to prosecute foreigners found guilty of criticizing the Chinese communist party. The decision seems to be focused on Ahmadis, an Islamic sect whose beliefs are considered blasphemous in Pakistan. The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority PTA sent a legal notice to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA demanding that it shuts down its website, trueislam.com , or get charged with blasphemy, a crime that carries a ten-year prison sentence.221 Chinese-American Socialite Who Rubbed Elbows With Hillary Clinton Jumps to Her Death222 Chinese-American socialite Luo Lili, 34, jumped to her death from her penthouse in Hong Kong on January 6th.

Christians are being slaughtered all across Africa, they are being taken to concentration camps in North Korea, thousands of churches have been brutally shut down under a new wave of persecution in China, and millions of believers throughout the Middle East must live knowing that each new day may be their last. Of course most Americans have never heard about any of this because the mainstream media wont cover it. Thankfully, there are organizations that do keep track of what is happening to Christians around the globe, and one of them is Open DoorsUSA. According to the group, the number of Christians that were killed for their faith was 60 percent higher in 2020 than it was in 2019 The watchdog organization Open DoorsUSA says levels of Christian persecution are at a record high around the world. Open Doors reports that levels of Christian persecution are at a record high, revealing that the number of Christians murdered for their faith rose 60 percent in 2020. A 6 percent rise in a single year would be bad. A 60 percent increase is a nightmare.225 Scientists Observe Quantum Sense Which May Explain How Animals See Magnetic Fields for First Time226 Scientists from the University of Tokyo claim to have observed a reaction showing quantum physics directly impacting biochemistry, which they suspect explains how certain animals can perceive the Earths magnetic field. Researchers have long suspected that some part of various animals visual systems, including migratory birds, allows them to perceive the Earths magnetic fields, affording them the ability to navigate vast distances during migratory periods, but have never been able to find the mechanism. Until now, that is. The University of Tokyo team used a custom microscope, which can detect extremely faint flashes of light, on a culture of human cells which contained an extremely light-sensitive material that can respond to changes in a magnetic field. Photoreceptors, called cryptochromes, are found in the cells of numerous species, including migratory birds and dogs and, curiously, humans.227 The Hong Kong Migrants Fleeing to the UK228 The UK will introduce a new visa at the end of January that will give 5.4 million Hong Kong residents a staggering 70 of the territorys population the right to come and live in the UK, and eventually become citizens. It is making this generous offer to residents of its former colony because it believes China is undermining Hong Kongs rights and freedoms. Not everyone will come. Some of those eligible to leave have expressed their determination to stay and continue the fight for democracy. In the end, Britain estimates that about 300,000 will take up the visa offer over the next five years.229 US Scientist Who Led Charge Against COVID Lab Leak Theory Admits He Was Trying to Protect Chinese Scientists230 The U.S. scientist behind an effort to stymie debate surrounding the possibility that COVID-19 could have accidentally escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology admitted through a spokesman that he did so to protect Chinese scientists from online criticism.

buffalo,Council considers action on fair housing law,2018-08-01T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WGRZ,"If we find out something is not being enforced or something is not staffed, it still becomes our responsibility to go back and fix the problem, said Council President Darius Pridgen, adding that the law is increasingly important as rising rents squeeze the citys supply of affordable housing. By the time this Council reconvenes in September, we will have looked into it thoroughly, Pridgen said. Other Council members agreed that the law should be acted on. Were always looking to make sure that it is enforced, that nobody falls through the cracks, said Council Majority Leader David Rivera. Rasheed Wyatt, who represents the University District, said he has heard complaints about the way the city handles fair housing cases that demand further scrutiny. We need fair housing in our community and we know that theres a propensity of people to discriminate based on what type of funding you receive for housing, he said. Mayor Byron Brown wont acknowledge any problems with the enforcement of the fair housing law, insisting last month that the city is very aggressive in its handling of discrimination complaints. Earlier this week, the mayors spokesperson refused further interview requests. Investigative Post, however, was only able to find one case in which the city had taken enforcement action against a landlord who violated the law. Dozens of others cases have sat in limbo4 for years. In many cases, an Investigative Post review of discrimination complaints found, there was no evidence that city officials had decided whether a landlord had discriminated when those decisions did come, they were painfully slow, rarely meeting the deadlines outlined in the law. Federal and state fair housing laws prohibit discrimination based on race, gender, and other categories, but the protection based on someones source of income exists only at the local level. That means victims of this kind of discrimination cant file complaints with state or federal agencies, only with the city. Its the citys law, said Daniel Corbitt, associate director of Housing Opportunities Made Equal5, a local fair housing organization contracts with to investigate and file discrimination complaints. We have to hold the city accountable. The post Council considers action on fair housing law6 appeared first on Investigative Post7.

buffalo,Buffalo lags on addressing lead poisoning,2019-05-01T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WGRZ,"The county has enacted the three recommendations it was asked to adopt. The state has implemented at least one of its five. However, Mayor Byron Brown and the Common Council have not enacted any of the eleven recommendations requiring city action. While the administration has done some of the necessary legwork, it has not yet translated it into proposed legislation or much in the way of policy. The Council has initiated nothing on its own. Everybody needs to be tested, every house needs to be tested, and remediated, and that has to happen, as soon as humanly possible, said John Washington, co-director of organizing at PUSH Buffalo, which is active on the West Side promoting affordable housing and social justice. Why the delay on the citys part? Brown refused to answer questions for this story. Louis Petrucci, assistant director at the citys department of Permit ...spection Services, told Investigative Post that work has been going on behind the scenes. We are hoping to roll out a variety of different initiatives in the very near future, he said.The problemLead, even in small traces, can have devastating effects on developing brains. In children, it can lead to learning difficulties, behavioral issues and health problems like high blood pressure and anemia. In 2017, about 700 children across the county were diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels, according to the state and county health departments. The vast majority live in Buffalos low-income neighborhoods. Children who live in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods are 12 times more likely than children in mostly white neighborhoods to have an elevated blood lead level, according to a study cited in the action plan. Investigative Post reported in 20155 that one zip code on Buffalos West Side and two on its East Side accounted for three of the four zip codes with the most new cases of lead poisoning in all of upstate. Reuters, in a 2017 national report6, declared Buffalo among the most dangerous lead hotspots in America. Lead poisoning rates in Buffalos hardest-hit neighborhoods were eight times higher than those in Flint, MI, during that citys water crisis, the news service reported. The main source of the problem in Buffalo is lead paint in the citys old housing stock. The action plan determined that children living in one and two family rental units are most at risk. With this in mind, the plan emphasized the need for legislation that would mandate all one and two family rentals be inspected for lead hazards on a regular basis. Other recommendations in the report include requiring contractors to provide ground cover when doing demolitions city, strengthening enforcement of lead safe work practice rules county, and lowering the level of lead within a childs blood that would trigger an intervention state. The report was released in March 2018 by the Community Foundation for Greater Buffalo, which worked with a variety of partners, including the city and county.County and state actionsErie County has adopted the three measures the action plan asked of it. We jumped right on the recommendations, and we are behind it, we want to do it, because we are all on the same page to eradicate lead poisoning, said Tom Muscarella, a senior public health sanitarian with the county Department of Health. Contractors and property owners have been required to follow lead safe work practices intended to avoid the spread of dust when disturbing lead paint. A change in the countys sanitary code provides inspectors with new enforcement powers. Previously, the primary agency responsible for enforcing lead safe work practices was the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But EPAs program has been extremely limited. In 2016, it settled7 with 123 contractors, landlords and property managers nationwide. Of these cases, only three were in New York and none were upstate. The county also stepped up enforcement action against landlords who knowingly rent housing with lead hazards. Violators are now referred to the Erie County District Attorneys office for possible criminal prosecution. Thats happened once already, when Maxim Levin, a landlord from Amherst, was charged in March.8 I got to give the county a lot of credit for seeing that landlord arrested last week, that should be shouted from the highest mountain top, McLellan, the environmental hazard trainer, said in April.Our Weekly Newsletter Ajax Frame9 The reports final recommendation to the county  to inspect the home of any family with a child under two who receive a security deposit from the county Department of Social Services  has generated only seven referrals, said Muscarella. The action plan also included five recommendations for state action. New York has adopted one, lowering the threshold for lead levels in a childs blood that trigger intervention. Recommendations not acted on include a state takeover of the EPA enforcement program for violations of lead safe work practices, as 14 other states have done.City inactionIn a press release10 last year, Brown said his administration would review the action plans recommendations and take the additional and necessary steps to protect children. As of today, none of the recommendations have been implemented, though the city is currently undertaking the legwork to enact several recommendations later this year. The key recommendation would mandate periodic interior inspections of one and two unit rentals for lead hazards. Related is a recommendation that owner-occupied doubles be required to register as rental properties and that the rental unit be subject to inspection. These changes would require Common Council approval. Rochester mandated11 interior inspections in 2005. Since then, the number of children diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels has dropped substantially. Why hasnt Buffalo gotten more done? In terms of the implementation, its a long process. The process is not just writing something down, said Petrucci, citing the need to draft legislation, hire staffers and find funding. Washington, the PUSH Buffalo organizer, said change is not happening fast enough. We are on a moving train and it is moving a lot faster than we have the resources to stop it with, he said.More information on lead poisoning An application for the county Department of Healths lead remediation program is available on its website12 or at 716-961-6800. Training in lead safe work practices, provided by the Department of Healths free to homeowners, is also available online13 or by calling 716 961-7582. People who would like to get an inspection of their home within the city limits can call 311 those in the rest of Erie County should contact the Department of Health.

Recently the market has gotten somewhat excited that the Federal Reserve might slow down the rate of Federal Funds tightening. This has been the result of three developments A few speeches from FOMC Board members that indicated the Federal Reserve was concerned about the flattening yield curve, and that the Feds goal would be to ensure it doesnt invert. A recent phenomenon where the effective Fed funds rate is trading at a higher spread to IOER interest on excess reserves. The increasing troubles in certain emerging market countries as US dollar liquidity has tightened. Between these three concerns, the market has built a dovish hike into todays FOMC announcement. Many participants believe the Fed is more likely to slow the pace of tightenings as opposed to increasing it. Well, sold to them. I am not claiming to know what the correct policy should be, but I am confident that Jerome Powells Federal Reserve will not alter course for any of these three reasons. The Federal Reserve will hike at least every other meeting until something breaks.

Reaction to the mayors proposal was mixed, with some Asian-American groups swiftly condemning the plan as racially biased. The Department of Education has struggled to find ways to diversify these specialized high schools. While black and Hispanic students account for 67 percent of public school students, they only made up 10 percent of the offers at these specialized high schools in the most recent school year. Asian-Americans, who make up 16 percent of public school students, received 52 percent of the offers in the past year. Kenneth Chiu, president of the New York City Asian-American Democratic Club, spoke to NY1 on Monday at a meeting in Sunset Park. He never had this problem when Stuyvesant High School was all white. He never had this problem when Stuyvesant was all Jewish, Chiu said. All of a sudden, they see one too many Chinese and they say, Hey, it isnt right. De Blasio was also accused of stereotyping against Asian-Americans who attend, or strive to attend, these specialized high schools. De Blasio is a little biased, Karlin Chan said, speaking to CBS2 on Monday. It showed implicit bias when he said all Asians are economically sound, well, we can afford tutoring. That sounds like a racist statement to me that reinforces a negative stereotype.54 Cudahy Mother Charged in Terrorism Plot to Use Facebook to Promote ISIS, FBI Says55 A Cudahy woman hacked social media accounts, including Facebook, to recruit on behalf of the Islamic State terrorist group and to provide instruction on such terrorism basics as making explosives and biological weapons including ricin, according to a federal criminal complaint.

The problem with the internet is anonymity, according to them. Wouldnt we all be better off if we were forced to identify ourselves before using social media platforms? The theory is people wont say mean, stupid, or regrettable things if their posts and comments are linked to their real names. Several years of Facebook-only commenting systems has proven this wrong. And yet the idea continues to be pushed by European politicians and DHS officials. The latest to call for an internet drivers license is UK security minister Ben Wallace. His theory is the use of real names and verifiable info will inflict mass civility on the internet, which is currently home to roving bands of ruffians and Wild West content. Paywall ahead. Alternate link to article provided by Alec Muffet, who has helpfully taken a screenshot of the print edition. Ben Wallace, a former soldier, said bullying and grooming occurred on social media because offenders believed they cannot be identified. It is mob rule on the internet. You shouldnt be able to hide behind anonymity as much as you can now, he added. Of course, it will all be so easy to implement in Wallaces limited view. After all, banks authenticate users identities, so it stands to reason people will be happy to turn over names, addresses, phone numbers, and whatever else might be demanded in exchange for the heightened possibility of being doxed, sued, or exposed to overbroad prosecutorial efforts. Wallace says theres a damn good reason to demand ID from everyone on the internet the children.

The move, which happened on June 12, effectively hurls Robinson into what supporters say is certain death. Onley, a notoriously violent prison, is overrun by Muslim gangs and has a reputation for riots. InfoWarss Paul Joseph Watson is reporting Onley has a 71 per cent Muslim population. Watson tweeted inmates were banging on Robinsons cell all night chanting death threats. According to a press release, Robinsons family confirms he has received numerous death threats from Muslim inmates who object to Robinsons critique of radical Islam. Theyve also reported he is sleeping in an unheated cell that has nothing but a thin mattress. The family believes the abrupt move, which happened without warning, was intended to disrupt a new legal appeal being put together in his defense. The family also believes the U.K. court system is intentionally putting Robinsons life in danger.101102 Viktor Orban Central Europe is in a Period of Great Creation, We Stand on the Verge of a True Central European Renaissance103 Prime Minister Viktor Orban described his talks with Slovak counterpart Peter Pellegrini on Tuesday as a meeting of two successful countries in a successful region.

French and Italian officials became embroiled in a war of words after Paris accused Rome of cynicism and urged it to reconsider its decision to reject a stranded migrant ship. Italy is faced with a humanitarian crisis showing no sign of abating and can no longer cope with the burden alone, Grard Larcher told Europe 1 radio. He said We have no right to lecture a country we have abandoned for the past three years. More than 700,000 migrants have landed on Italys shores since 2013.

Who are these people? They are what Jordan Peterson calls the post-modernists neo-Marxist professors who dominate our colleges and universities. And heres the worst part we are financing these nihilists with tax dollars, alumni gifts and tuition payments. Time to wise up. TRANSCRIPT You may not realize it, but you are currently funding some dangerous people. They are indoctrinating young minds throughout the West with their resentment-ridden ideology. They have made it their lifes mission to undermine Western civilization itself, which they regard as corrupt, oppressive and patriarchal. If youre a taxpayer  or paying for your kids liberal arts degree  youre underwriting this gang of nihilists. Youre supporting ideologues who claim that all truth is subjective that all sex differences are socially constructed and that Western imperialism is the sole source of all Third World problems. They are the post-modernists, pushing progressive activism at a college near you. They produce the mobs that violently shut down campus speakers the language police who enshrine into law use of fabricated gender pronouns and the deans whose livelihoods depend on madly rooting out discrimination where little or none exists. Their thinking took hold in Western universities in the 60s and 70s, when the true believers of the radical left became the professors of today. And now we rack up education-related debt  not so that our children learn to think critically, write clearly, or speak properly, but so they can model their mentors destructive agenda. Its now possible to complete an English degree and never encounter Shakespeare  one of those dead white males whose works underlie our society of oppression. To understand and oppose the post-modernists, the ideas by which they orient themselves must be clearly identified.136 Paul Craig Roberts In the Western World, Truth is an Endangered Species137 Nowhere in the Western world is truth respected. Even universities are imposing censorship and speech control. Governments are shutting down, and will eventually criminalize, all explanations that differ from official ones. The Western world no longer has a print and TV media. In its place there is a propaganda ministry for the ruling elite.138  1  2 317004  3 317008  4 317079  5 316997  6 317045  7 317047  8 317006  9 317073  10 317029  11 317016  12 316996  13 317077  14 317035  15 317065  16 317059  17 317021  18 317039  19 317037  20 316999  21 316995  22 317067  23 317027  24 317033  25 317031  26 317019  27 317014  28 316994  29 317041  30 317075  31 317051  32 317010  33 317081  34 317069  35 317061  36 317071  37 317055  38 317063  39 317023  40 317057  41 317025  42 317043  43 317049  44 317053  45 317012  46 317002  47  48 topheadline  49  50 topheadline  51  52 topheadline  53  54 topheadline  55  56 topheadline  57  58 topheadline  59  60 topheadline  61  62 topheadline  63  64 topheadline  65  66 topheadline  67  68  69 topheadline  70  71 topheadline  72  73 topheadline  74  75 topheadline  76  77 topheadline  78  79 topheadline  80  81 topheadline  82  83 topheadline  84  85 topheadline  86  87 topheadline  88  89 topheadline  90  91 topheadline  92  93 topheadline  94  95 topheadline  96  97 topheadline  98  99 topheadline  100  101  102 topheadline  103  104 topheadline  105  106 topheadline  107  108 topheadline  109  110 topheadline  111  112 topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117  118 topheadline  119  120 topheadline  121  122 topheadline  123  124 topheadline  125  126 topheadline  127  128 topheadline  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline","homeless, homelessness"

Hosted by Secretary of State John Kerry, the Our Oceans conference is a two-day event in Washington focusing on issues like pollution and climate change. Kerry has made the issue of addressing climate change28 a central focus of his tenure at the State Department, and Obama thanked him for his dedication in that department. He has elevated the profile of climate change, ocean protection, to the point where we have conversations about this not just in the Oval Office but in the Situation Room, Obama said. And that is critical in helping us mobilize all of government around the issues that all of you care so deeply about. Obama has expressed strong concern about climate change, particularly in his second term, calling the trends29 terrifying. What makes climate change difficult is that it is not an instantaneous catastrophic event, he said last year. Its a slow-moving issue that, on a day-to-day basis, people dont experience and dont see.

We are reminded of the millions of refugees around the globe who are spending this sacred holiday separated from their families, unsure of their future, but still hoping for a brighter tomorrow, Obama said. He told Americans that the United States is determined to welcome Muslim refugees and immigrants into the country.

It is at IRIN38 a news site aimed at a humanitarian audience. After wading through the many paragraphs on what is expected to happen not much with the United Nations Refugee shindig on the 19th in New York, we come to the important section about Obamas special propaganda show on the 20th. We expect him to use the gathering to lecture and guilt-trip Americans into welcoming even more of the third world to live in your neighborhoods. I have to laugh at one thing a few paragraphs into the article below. Only countries willing to help are invited. So this is what I want to know, if Ethiopia is on the list, does that mean they plan to keep more of their people at home and not transport them to America as refugees? From IRIN39 hat tip Joanne With hopes already dashed that anything substantial will come out of the UN summit, some are looking to the Leaders Summit on Refugees that President Barack Obama will convene on the margins of the General Assembly the following day to deliver more tangible outcomes. But while there are relatively few unknowns associated with the UN summit, the leaders gathering on Tuesday, 20 September is one big unknown. The stated aims of the leaders summit are to double the number of refugees who are resettled or admitted through other legal channels to third countries to increase funding for humanitarian responses by 30 percent and to increase the number of refugees in school and who are granted the legal right to work by one million each More40 Breaking State Department announces plan to bring in 110,000 refugees next fiscal year41 Daniel Horowitz Conservative Review September 13, 2016 Earlier today, pursuant to the Refugee Act of 1980, which requires the State Department to consult with Congress on the annual level of refugee intake, the Obama administration announced its plans to admit 110,000 refugees in FY 2017 beginning October 1. That is a 25,000 net increase from this current fiscal year level, and a 40,000 net increase from most recent years. It is also 10,000 more than the State Department projected for FY 2017 during last Septembers consultation with Congress. Are the people and their representatives powerless in stopping this forced transformation? As I wrote in Stolen Sovereignty42, Ted Kennedy promised that the 1980 refugee bill would limit the flow of refugees and increase Congressional input in the process. Refugee intake was to be capped at 50,000 a year. But in a sleight of hand that the public would have never approved had it been advertised in a transparent way, the president was granted de facto unilateral authority to increase the flow over and beyond the 50,000 cap beginning in 1983 in consultation with Congress. Initially, Congress took the annual consultations, usually occurring in September prior to the next fiscal years, quite seriously. They conducted hearings and spelled out the refugee needs and concerns. Now it has become nothing more than State Department officials briefing the House and Senate Judiciary Committee on how many refugees they will take in with no recourse from Congress to say no. Thus, we are stuck with this massive social transformation and security risk, and no ability to stop it statutorily. Just today, Germany arrested three Syrian refugees43 on suspicion that they have ties to the Islamic State. That Obama could unilaterally force a similar policy down the throats of American citizens and Congress sits back impotently without learning the lessons of Europe is horrific. With two weeks remaining to the current fiscal year, we have already admitted 11,503 Syria refugees. According to the State Department refugee database44, as of September 13, roughly 99.3 percent of the Syrian refugees are Muslim, despite the Christians taking the brunt of the ethnic persecution, which is the main determinant of refugee status based on statute. 8,436 refugees were brought in from Somalia, the 25th consecutive year of refugee intake from that country - a country of origin that has proven to pose one of the greatest security risks in terms of homegrown terror45. All but two were Muslim. Overall, roughly half the 77,000 refugees admitted so far this year46 are Muslim and from volatile places such as Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, and Syria. Also disturbing is the fact that Obama is seeding small communities with large numbers of refugees who are radically different from the local population, and he refusing to cooperate with state and local officials. The administration has declined to inform governors47 of refugee resettlement, even after refugees were resettled in their respective jurisdictions, despite the legal requirement of advanced consultation with states. And while courts grant illegal immigrants standing to sue for citizen rights, they block states from suing Obama for violating the refugee statutes48 More49 Where are legally required hearings in House and Senate on Obama refugee plan for FY2017?50 Ann Corcoran Refugee Resettlement Watch September 8, 2016 President Barack Hussein Obama will send his final determination letter to Capitol Hill this month with the number of refugees 200,000?51 he wants admitted to the country in Fiscal Year 2017 which begins in 23 days! Im guessing the letter and the required report wont be delivered until his big show at the UN on September 20th. That gives little time for Congress to do the job legally required of it under the Refugee Act of 1980 and that is to hold hearings in both the House52 and Senate Judiciary Committees53. However since both committees know what is required of them, they could have the hearings on their respective committee calendars for the week immediately following the 20th. I am not seeing anything on either of their calendars. I wont stop beating this drum! The number of refugees admitted to the US this coming year will depend on the REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS not on Obama!. They can cut the funding for the program and thus cut the number of refugees placed in your towns! If they want to! Last year was the first year in many, many years where the House Judiciary Committee and Senate Judiciary Committees held any legally required hearing on the Presidents plan and that is only because so many of you were clamoring for hearings in light of the huge Syrian numbers being proposed you know the number will be even bigger this year, Hillary wants 65,000!. But, both hearings came after the fiscal year had begun. See here here54 too little too late. Because they want to get home and campaign this fall, they will have adjourned and there will be no hearings in October, therefore we must demand a hearing in both committees this month! More55 Obamas 110,000 refugees only half the story56 European-style meltdown feared if Hillary elected Leo Hohmann World Net Daily September 15, 2016 The White House kicked off Welcoming Refugee Week57 Thursday, two days after it informed Congress it would be boosting the number of refugees delivered to American shores by nearly 30 percent. The Obama administration told Congress it wants to permanently resettle 110,000 refugees in fiscal 2017 which begins Oct. 1, roughly half of them coming from Syria, Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Burma and other jihadist hotspots where vetting of refugees is extremely difficult. Thats a frightening number for many conservatives in Congress - up 29 percent from 2016 levels of 85,000 refugees, and up 57 percent from 2015 when 70,000 refugees were delivered to U.S. cities and towns. But the actual numbers will likely end up being much higher than even the president is admitting, possibly as high as 150,000 to 200,000, experts say. Thats because, as WND earlier reported, the Obama administration has consulted with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grande on ways to bring more refugees from Syria into the United States under alternative pathways. This stream of refugees would not be called refugees at all, but rather they would enter the U.S. on student visas, health visas, expansion of the family-reunification visa and other creative methods. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, a law authored by the late Ted Kennedy, most of the authority over the program was given to the executive branch. Congress controls funding for the program, but everything else - how many refugees come from what countries and where they get sent upon arrival in the U.S. - is controlled by the president. Congress, regardless of what party is in control, has in 35 years never denied funding for a presidents refugee program, meaning it is very unlikely it will do so this year. Finally, the people get a choice But this year, the American people actually have a choice, by electing Donald Trump to the White House, says conservative writer Daniel Horowitz, author of Stolen Sovereignty58. Trump has said he will stop all refugee resettlement from terrorist-harboring countries. His opponent, Hillary Clinton, has said she intends to increase the resettlements from Syria by 550 percent More59 Flint, Michigan City Leaders Not Informed by Feds of Plan to Send 100 Syrian, Iraqi Refugees60 It is crystal clear that Obama and his gang are trying to distract us from the Islamist threat with shiny objects like global warming and Islamify our nation by stealth while we are looking in another direction Dave Michael Patrick Leahy Breitbart News 15 Sep 2016 Breitbart News has learned that a resettlement agency funded by the Obama administration plans to send 100 Iraqi and Syrian refugees to Flint, Michigan, in the fiscal year that begins next month on October 1. But that plan appears to violate a clause in the federal Refugee Act of 198061 which requires the federal government and director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement to consult with local as well as state governments prior to the placement of any refugees within their boundaries. At this point it appears city leaders have not been informed of the details regarding this matter, a spokesperson for Mayor Karen Weaver and the city of Flint tells Breitbart News. Its the same story with the government of Genesee County, in which Flint is located. As of this time the Genesee County Board of Commissioners has not been notified of any settlement of 100 refugees from Middle East - South Asia, Jamie Curtis, Chairman of the Genesee County Board of Commissioners, tells Breitbart News through a spokesperson. Flint, a city of 100,000, is in the midst of a financial and public health crisis due to high levels of lead in its drinking water62 after a 2014 change in its source from the Detroit Sewage and Water System to the Flint River63. According to this FY 2017 abstract64 submitted to the Department of State by Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which operates in Michigan as Samaritas, the resettlement agency plans to bring 100 Iraqi and Syrian refugees to Flint Michigan in the twelve month fiscal year that begins in less than three weeks. The document was obtained in a Freedom of Information Act FOIA request from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. With all the financial and public health problems the city of Flint, Michigan faces, critics are wondering if it makes any sense to force 100 Syrian and Iraqi refugees upon the citizens of Flint, Michigan. The Obama administration told Congress on Tuesday it wants to increase the number of refugees65 brought into the U.S. in FY 2017 to 110,000 up 29 from 85,000 in FY 2016. Unless Congress specifically rejects Obamas plan, that 110,000 number will go into effect starting October 1. Resettlement agency abstracts across the country are almost always rubber-stamped by the Obama administration. That is likely to be the case in Michigan in FY 2017, as Breitbart reported recently66 More67 Resettlement Agencies Increase Middle East-South Asia Refugees in Michigan by 40 Percent, Send 100 to Flint68 Also, notice how these resettlement agencies are renaming themselves in order to dissociate from their Christian and Jewish origins It is just another sign that they have sold out and have become mere extensions of Obamas immigration policies Dave Michael Patrick Leahy Breitbart News 14 Sep 2016 Breitbart News has obtained the FY 2017 refugee resettlement proposals from the five leading resettlement agencies that operate in Michigan showing they plan to jam down a 40 percent increase in refugees from the Middle East-South Asia region, which includes Syria, on residents of Michigan in the fiscal year that begins on October 1. These plans in Michigan are completely consistent with the nationwide refugee number determination the Obama Administration presented to Congress69 on Tuesday an increase of the FY 2017 ceiling by 29 percent to 110,000, up from the ceiling of 85,000 that was approved for FY 2016. The actual final number for FY 2016 is likely to reach or exceed the original ceiling number, if the run rate of the last few months continues for the final two weeks of the fiscal year. In their FY 2016 plans, these five agencies-Lutheran Social Services which recently changed the name of its Michigan operation to Samaritas70, Church World Service71, Catholic Charities72, HIAS73 formerly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and Episcopal Migration Ministries74 proposed 4,060 refugees overall to be resettled in Michigan, 2,567 from the Middle East-South Asia region, which includes Syria. As of September 13, 3,783 75total refugees, 1,21776 of whom are from Syria, have been resettled in Michigan to date this fiscal year. At the accelerated run rate of the past few months, year end numbers are likely to hit or exceed the FY 2016 plan for 4,000 total refugees in Michigan, of which over 1,300 are Syrian refugees. The FY 2017 plans, obtained through Freedom of Information Act request made to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services by a local Michigan grassroots group as were the FY 2016 plans, show that that these five resettlement agencies have proposed a 38 percent increase in overall refugee resettlement, up to 5,606 refugees. This includes a 40 percent increase in refugees from the Middle East-South Asia region that includes Syria, to 3,586 More77 Obama Administration to Oakland County, Michigan No, We Wont Comply with Refugee Law78 Michael Patrick Leahy Breitbart News 8 Sep 2016 Robert Carey, the Obama administrations director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement ORR, recently told Oakland County, Michigan that the agency he directs has no intention of complying with the Refugee Act of 198079s requirement that it consult regularly with local governments concerning the sponsorship process and the intended distribution among the States and localities before their placement in those States and localities. In a letter to Carey dated June 17, Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson wrote It has come to my attention that between October 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016, 1,860 refugees have been placed in the State of MichiganOf those 1,860 refugees estimates are that hundreds of them have been resettled in Oakland County. Oakland County has not been consulted with respect to the placement of refugees in our jurisdiction. Exact numbers of refugees placed in Oakland County are not readily available as the federal government is not performing its statutory duty to consult with local governments as discussed below. Patterson then requested and demanded that the Office of Refugee Resettlement . . . 1. provide Oakland County with all pertinent information regarding all refugees settled in Oakland County in the past two years and . . . 2. begin consulting with us quarterly as required by federal law concerning refugees to be resettled in the county in the future. Careys response to Pattersons demand was condescending and dismissive Concerning your request about consultation, Michigan submitted a State Plan for fiscal year 2016 describing resettlement activities in the state. In the State Plan, Michigan stated that consultation meetings would be convened on at least a quarterly basis with representatives of local affiliates of resettlement agencies, state and local government agencies, and other community-based organizations that serve refugees. These meetings are held in each of the three resettlement regions in Michigan. Additionally, the Michigan Refugee Advisory Council facilitates coordination among resettlement partners across the state. I encourage you to work with state officials to ensure you are included in these consultation meetings in the future. ORR, in turn, works through the State Refugee Coordinator and its regional representatives to maintain open communications with the state. Carey places the burden for finding out about these consultation meetings and attending them on Oakland County. The Refugee Act of 1980, however, requires both the director of ORR and the federal agency administering the program, which could mean an employee of ORR, to consult with the locality prior to the placement of refugees there. The statute does not include any provision to accomplish this consultation through the State Refugee Coordinator, who actually is an employee of the state government, not a representative of the federal bureaucracy. Carey also dismissed Oakland Countys demand to obtain all pertinent information regarding all refugees settled in Oakland County in the past two years You requested pertinent information regarding all refugees settled in Oakland County in the past two years and ORR does not share personally identifiable information about refugees. Therefore, we cannot fulfill your request. The Refugee Act of 1980, however, specifically requires that all public health problems associated with specific refugees be reported to county officials. As Breitbart reported80 Refugee resettlement agencies are required by the Refugee Act of 1980 to assure that refugees, known to the agency as having been identified . . . as having medical conditions affecting the public health and requiring treatment such as active and latent TB, report to the appropriate county or other health agency, and that their health status is subsequently monitored by both the county or other health agencies More81 Forget asking nicely, time to use freedom of information laws Michigan model82 Ann Corcoran Refugee Resettlement Watch September 15, 2016 We learned this week that the Obama Administration is setting the table for a huge increase in the number of refugees to be admitted to the US for the new fiscal year which begins October 1, presumably setting things up for a Hillary presidency and making it harder for a Trump administration to pull those numbers back in January without hate-filled attacks against him whenif he does. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth waahhh! with refugee contractors saying they are already in the pipeline. We also know that the REPUBLICAN Congress has the final word because they can appropriate money for the program or withhold the funding in the next few weeks and months. However, now that the Presidential determination has been sent to Congress83 there is no reason a local refugee office or a state refugee coordinator should withhold from you the Reception and Placement Abstract84 which lays out how many the local resettlement contractor is planning for your town. I know many of you have been asking nicely for those important planning documents and are being rebuffed. They like to use the excuse that they were in the deliberative stage with their plans for your communities, but that excuse is now gone! All of those documents were used to prepare the determination that has been delivered to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. BTW, you might look at the rosters for both committees and see if your Member of Congress or Senator is on the committee, then get on the phone and call their office and tell them you want the R P Abstract for ____federal resettlement agency working in your towncity. Put the office to work for you! LOL! Ill bet your Washington rep has never seen the documents that will ultimately change his or her district forever! However, you may just have to go the FOIA route. Every state has a Public Information law it might not be called FOIA where you live, FOIA usually refers to the federal law managed by your states attorney general. For example, here is Marylands.85 Find the site where you live and then use the request letter template they provide. When using the state FOIAs, response time is pretty quick usually More86 Now they are after West Virginia as new refugee office planned for state capitol87 Ann Corcoran Refugee Resettlement Watch September 13, 2016 West Virginia has been near the bottom of the list of resettlement states for the last 9 years that Ive followed the UNUS State Department Refugee Admissions Program, but all that could change. Resettlement contractors are running out of housing and frankly welcome where they have overloaded cities like Lancaster88,PA do you want WV schools to have to cope with this! and Buffalo,89 NY so they are casting about looking for fresh territory populated with lots of naive do-gooders!. A couple of years ago the folks in Wyoming able to hold off a program there. Montana couldnt quite manage it and now has homeless refugees90 in Missoula. Rutland91, VT citizens are working hard to turn back the plan to bring Syrians to their city. And despite what this story from the Charleston Gazette implies, a pocket of resistance is growing in Charleston, WV. Most eastern states have not dodged a bullet LOL! except for Joe Bidens Delaware92. West Virginia has always been near the bottom of the list of states being targeted. Not anymore. See my earlier post on Charleston, here93. Imagine in a state where the coal mining industry has been decimated by Obama, they are now being asked to welcome impoverished refugees from mostly the Middle East and Africa with a new resettlement office in Charleston! Where are West Virginias two US Senators? Where is Rep. Alex Mooney94 a Freedom Caucus member95 who represents Charleston? Are they o.k. with importing more poverty for the state? And, dont miss the fact that WV Rep. Evan Jenkins96 is on the House Appropriations Committee. All three, Capito, Mooney and Jenkins could bring this plan to a screeching halt if they wanted to! From the Charleston Gazette97 earlier this month Of the more than 10,000 Syrian refugees placed in the United States this fiscal year, just five were resettled in West Virginia, but efforts persist to make the state a haven for Syrians fleeing the carnage of civil war in their country. Charleston is still in the running to become one of the Episcopal Migration Ministries resettlement communities. The resettlement agency has 30 similar communities throughout the United States where local organizations assist the refugees with translation, finding work and health care, getting to know their community and other services More98 Breaking news! White House kicking off Welcoming Refugee Week today99 Ann Corcoran Refugee Resettlement Watch September 15, 2016 As I have been saying, the refugee industry has a masterful media propaganda campaign backing Obamas last big push to change America by changing its people. In less than 30 minutes the White House launches its part of the highly orchestrated Refugee Extravaganza leading up to Obamas United Nations shindig this coming Tuesday. Get in on the action! If you tweet, use RefugeesWelcome and WelcomingWeek100. Tell them what you think!

You can follow along at whitehouse.govlive from 230p.m. to 530p.m. EST and share your thoughts on social media using the hashtags RefugeesWelcome and WelcomingWeek.101 Our county has a rich tradition of welcoming refugees. Over the past 40 years, our nation has resettled over 3.2 million refugees from countries that span the globe. President Obama believes that we are stronger as a nation when we welcome immigrants and refugees into our communities and harness their skills. This year, we are proud to announce that we have met our goal of welcoming 10,000 Syrian refugees a month ahead of schedule, and we are well on our way to welcoming 85,000 refugees to our shores in 2016. And in 2017, we will seek to resettle 110,000 refugees, increasing the number of people we receive by almost 60 percent over a two-year period. Thanks for being part of this vital conversation and for acting to make RefugeesWelcome.

The International Rescue Committee tells us105 that do-gooderism is secondary to making smart business decisions that they say are driving these companies. Ha! I bet the IRCs volunteers think this is all about humanitarian zeal! Americans first! Wouldnt it be smart to train and hire needy American citizens first especially in cities hard hit by unemployment that leads to hopelessness and crime? Apparently not! So if its simply good business Are refugee laborers willing to work more cheaply? Are refugee laborers subsidized by government programs and therefore tax credits fall to companies who hire them? Are refugee laborers trapped they cant easily go home or quit the job? Are refugee laborers more compliant and less willing to complain about working conditions? Are refugee laborers pawns who are really here to change the demographic make-up of Americaapparently supported by the companies Obama has lined up below? We have previously reported on Chobani Yogurt Chiptotle106, both glowingly described107 by the International Rescue Committee remember they gave George Soros108 their Freedom award recently which directs us to Obamas Partnership for Refugees109 sure to be on full display at the United Nations next week at Obamas shindig110 on the 20th. Here is what the IRC says about Hamdi Ulukaya at Chobani a leader of the Hijra! Other companies have worked on the problem more deliberately. At Chobani whose Kurdish CEO, Hamdi Ulukaya, has committed the majority of his personal wealth to ending the refugee crisis the company started hiring refugees soon after it started to grow. Resettled refugees now make up 30 of the companys employees. This, however, isnt without political challenges Chobani has faced criticism and calls for boycotts from conservatives who argue that the company is taking jobs from American-born workers. Another company the IRC gives a glowing report about is Starwood Hotels they need maids and janitors and according towikipedia111 the massive chain may be bought out by Marriott. The Marriotts are long time big supporters of amnesty and more refugee resettlement. Your communities are being changed forever so that giant corporations can have cheap compliant labor! More112 So who are the refugee resettlement contractors targeting on the Hill today and in to next week?113 Ann Corcoran Refugee Resettlement Watch September 15, 2016 This isnt about anything other than money for them from you for salaries, for offices, for travel, and to pay for their lobbyists who in turn look for more money to promote their political views. Originally the Refugee Act was supposed to be about a publicprivate partnership, but the contractors now rely almost completely on your money. Here114 below is who is being targeted by the refugee industry today. You should be calling too! As soon as I see any news about their postcard dump115, Ill post it! From Refugees Welcome Take Action TODAY Tell House and Senate Leadership to Increase Refugee Funding Heres a sample of what to say As Congress considers Fiscal Year 2017 funding, I urge them to increase funding for the Office of Refugee Resettlement and the Migration and Refugee Assistance account to support refugee assistance overseas and refugee resettlement in the United States, over and above last years levels.

RefugeesWelcome116 More117 More refugees resettled in Fargo area than anywhere else in North Dakota118 Two key points Dave Once the resettlement process starts, it accelerates becauseexisting refugees can bring in relatives using an expedited process The big businesses that convince politicians to bring in refugeescan have economic downturnsas happened to North Dakotas fracking industrywhen Saudi Arabia flooded the oil market and drove prices downThese businesses have not only swapped out American workersfor low-wage refugeesthey have abandoned they brought in and spiked the local unemployment rateswith refugees who now have little hope of finding a job. Archie Ingersoll Grand Forks Herald Sep 8, 2016 FARGO By a wide margin, the Fargo area takes in more refugees than any other place in North Dakota. Fargo, West Fargo and Moorhead, Minn., have received a total of 6,220 refugees since 1997 over three times the number who arrived in Grand Forks and Bismarck combined, according to Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota LSS, the nonprofit group hired by the federal government to resettle refugees in North Dakota and Moorhead. Cass County Commissioner Chad Peterson brought up this discrepancy at a meeting of refugee resettlement officials on Thursday, Sept. 8. He told the group hed like to see refugees spread more proportionately across the state, given that Cass Countys social service system doesnt have enough money to meet their needs. Right now, our social services is overburdened to the nth degree, he said. There is a substantive burden spent when we have folks in this quantity coming in that make the lower salaries. Cass County represents 23 percent of North Dakotas population. But the county has taken in 72 percent of the states refugees in fiscal year 2016, which ends this month, according to LSS. Shirley Dykshoorn, who oversees refugee resettlement for LSS, said one reason so many refugees land in the Fargo area is the availability of housing and support services, as well as job and education opportunities. Another factor is that the Fargo area has the states biggest ethnic community, and a large amount of LSS resettlement work involves reuniting incoming refugees with relatives already living here. Family ties help remove or reduce isolation, and support the families, Dykshoorn said, noting that refugees without ties are mostly being sent to Bismarck. County Commissioner Mary Scherling, who also attended Thursdays meeting, said she embraces having refugees in the community, but she believes resettlement needs to be done in a fiscally sound way We want to make sure that we have the resources to support people when they come here as well, and maybe other communities could share that responsibility with us It shouldnt be a burden to Cass County taxpayers only. Peterson said he expects oil extraction in western North Dakota to eventually ramp up again, at which point communities there could benefit from refugee workers More119 Paris building refugee camps, segregating the sexes120 Ann Corcoran Refugee Resettlement Watch September 7, 2016 Invasion of Europe news Refugee camp to open in Paris in October. It isnt quite this bad here. We dont have camps yet, but.. could it happen? Already housing is short for the tens of thousands of refugees Obama and the Republican Congress have admitted this fiscal year. We still have over 10,000 to squeeze in to America this month see here121! And, we have tens of thousands of so-called unaccompanied alien children to house. Could we end up with refugee camps in America? Thanks to Joanne for this story from France at the Huffington Post122. You will have to read it yourself because it wont allow any snips. The gist of the story is that so many asylum seekers are building make-shift camps that the powers-that-be have decided to build them some nice ones right in Paris. They are segregating the refugees by sex because of all the rape and other sexual abuse going on in refugee housing throughout Europe More123 Overloaded Buffalo, NY running out of housing for refugees bring in prefabs?124 Ann Corcoran Refugee Resettlement Watch September 8, 2016 So what else is new. We told you here just the other day125 that Missoula, MT, which is getting its first refugees, cant even find housing for the first arrivals. Obamas resettlement contractors are plowing ahead nevertheless trying to hit the 85,000 mark for this fiscal year see here126. I wonder does the US State Department give them a pass on their contracts which require providing a properly-sized house or apartment so they can get those bodies in here before the bell tolls midnight on Sept. 30th? And, what makes them think they will have housing for 200,000 next year when they cant find it for 85,000 this year? If your town is gleefully building low income housing, be ready for refugees!

Posted to my report131 Saturday headlined, The big lie refugees are not being vetted, this is what domstudent11 reports Ann, they are indeed not being vetted! As a shocking update to the refugee family in my family members apartment Evanston, IL, it turns out that these people LIED to World Relief and the church that sponsored them. They were evicted last week after doing over 4,500 worth of damage to the apartment. When the landlord tried to bill them for repairs, it turned out that EVERY piece of information they gave to World Relief and the church was a LIE. The Evanston Police are now involved. This family has gone underground. So much for vetting. Even the contractors are fooled! What are the two important points to take away? First, refugees are not being thoroughly vetted some not vetted at all, and that landlords are increasingly wary of leasing to refugees especially as we learned here132, the resettlement contractors dropping them in your towns will not back up the refugees by co-signing their leases amazing!. BTW, if the lazy, fearful complicit Members of Congress really wanted to reform this program they could make some simple fixes initially and one would be to make it a law that federal resettlement contractors must co-sign every home or apartment lease when they place refugees. And, make sure damages come from their own meager, privately raised funds not from more of your tax dollars More133 Northhampton, Mass. to hold two welcoming public conversations this month134 Ann Corcoran Refugee Resettlement Watch September 7, 2016 We told you the other day that Northhampton, Massachusetts was ready and eager to welcome Syrian Muslims 99 of Syrians being admitted to the US are Muslims this coming fiscal year which begins in only a few weeks, on October 1. Catholic Charities, the primary resettlement agency there is holding two meetings this month to find support and help for the refugees because they do admit that after 90 days Catholic Charities taxpayer-funded help ends. At that time the refugees become dependent on the goodwill of the city and the welfare that Catholic Charities has signed them up for. Here is the news at Masslive.com135. Our earlier post on the new refugee program for Northhampton is here136. How is the housing in this upscale city? A shortage of housing seems to be a growing problem everywhere. Northampton residents are invited to attend two public conversations on the upcoming resettlement of 51 refugees into the city. Catholic Charities of Springfield, the agency contracted with the State Department to facilitate the resettlement, will host the sessions along with a welcome home steering group of local leaders. The first, to be held Sept. 19 from 630 to 830 p.m. in the JFK Middle School cafeteria, will be attended by Mayor David Narkewicz. The second will take place Sept. 24 from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Northampton Senior Center. Susannah Crolius, the Catholic Charities coordinator of outreach and resource development, said the conversations are part of an effort to build a long-term support and integration network for the refugees The State Department typically provides funding for 90 days of services after refugees relocate to the United States.Catholic Charities gets a cut of that for administering the program ed Catholic Charities is adopting a small-scale, carefully planned approach, Crolius said 51 is the minimum number of refugees a host community can accept. The following year CC will ask for 100 until like Lancaster, PA, the city could get up to 900 a year. ed More137 The continuing budget resolution has destroyed Congress power to limit government138 Ann Corcoran Refugee Resettlement Watch September 9, 2016 Neither the Democrats or the Republicans want to limit it!

This is the next installment in my recent civics lesson Im learning this too! in what I hope is not a vain time wasting effort to focus your attention on the Republicans in Congress. Below is an excellent 2013 explanation by author Angelo Codevilla about how Congressional leaders Rs and Ds have subverted the Constitution to advance permanent ruling class control over our government and your money! Hat tip Richard at Blue Ridge Forum139. From Library of Law and Liberty140 sorry to snip so much but please read this and then continue reading the whole article The current battle over whether the 2013 Continuing Appropriations Resolution CR should de-fund Obamacare or not substitute this years battle over refugee funding ed is the latest instance in which the CR mechanism is being used on behalf of a big government program the demise of which would be certain were Congress to play its Constitutional role by following its regular order as the keeper of the peoples purse - a role fundamental to democracy. Herewith, a brief explanation of how new the CR system of funding the US government is, and how radically subversive of republican government. Important to America as Obamacares fate may be, the current battles stake is nothing less than whether the people can control government through their representatives or whether government can define its own scope and powers. Since the Middle Ages, the first and most basic restraint on arbitrary government has been the peoples power to decide how much money the government will spend, and for what purposes. The US Constitution puts it this way No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of Appropriations made by law Art. I sect.9. Nowadays however our bipartisan ruling class limits the Congress opportunity to approve, disapprove, or modify what the government does, to voting on Continuing Appropriations Resolutions - single, all-inclusive bills crafted behind closed doors. Then it cynically asks the peoples representatives will you agree to laws no one has read, to programs on the continuation of which you have not voted, and to regulations that havent been written yet, or will you shut down the government? This turns democracy into a choice between tyranny and anarchy. Until circa 1990, Americans had taken seriously the relationship between appropriations and democracy. House and Senate used to divide the Executive departments requests for funds and programs into multiple categories and sub-categories. Then many committees and subcommittees held hearings on each item, followed by mark-up sessions in which each would be modified and voted on. Thereafter, the full House and Senate would debate, amend, approve or disapprove them, one by one. This was regular order - more or less as described in civics books. This changed at first gradually in the 1980s, when Democrats and Republicans who were resisting the Reagan Administrations efforts to trim government figured out that individual appropriations bills delayed until the end of the fiscal year could be rolled together into omnibus bills. These could be advertised as merely continuing the current years programs and spending levels. In reality, these all-in-one bills 1 protected current programs from scrutiny, amendment, or repeal 2 were stuffed with new favors, programs, provisions and priorities that could not have survived an open process . the Republican leadership, by acquiescing in the practice of funding the government by Continuing Resolutions rather than by individual appropriations has emasculated the most virile means by which mankind has ever limited government More141 Nets Blackout State Department Admitting Ineffectiveness of Iran Deal142 Nicholas Fondacaro Media Research Center September 14, 2016 When the Obama administration finished constructing the Iran nuclear agreement the public was told, and the liberal media supported, claims that the deal would lead to smoother negotiations and interactions with the country. Now, under questioning from Fox News, the Obama administration is allowing for the possibility that they were wrong, announced Special Report anchor Bret Baier Tuesday, And that the nuclear deal may be making the behavior of the Iranian regime worse. Even with such a shocking change in position the Big Three networks failed to report it. After noting some of the recent aggressive confrontations perpetrated by Iran in the Persian Gulf against US forces, Fox News Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen reported the Obama administrations stunning admission. Now for the first time, the Obama administration admits the presidents signature foreign policy initiative, the Iran nuclear deal, which went into effect in January, could be worsening, not improving, Irans behavior, Rosen reported. Rosen asked State Department spokesperson Mark Toner if he can rule out the Iran Deal as a cause of the increased hostility. I cant rule that out. Iran, like many countries has an internal political process thats defined by a lot of different dynamics, Toner responded to the Fox News journalist. He noted that Toners statement is a departure from the administrations usual position, since on August 30 Central Command Commander, General Joseph Votel stated to the press, I would say we havent seen a significant change in their behavior. According to Rosen, this admission comes as new details are emerging of Irans dealing with Al Qaeda during the hunt for Osama bin Laden and beyond The picture of an emboldened Iran emerges as lawmakers have begun examining a small set of documents from the Osama bin Laden archive that US Forces captured in the raid that killed the Al Qaeda chief in 2011. The House intelligence chairman told Fox News those documents connect Iran and Al Qaeda more closely than the administration has publicly acknowledged. Nor is the IranAl Qaeda connection solely a thing of the past, Rosen continued, This summer, the Treasury Department sanctioned three senior Al Qaeda figures living in Iran, who are said to be using that country for a base from which to move money around, acquire weapons, and coordinate with other terrorists. Even this disturbing connection between Iran and Al Qaeda has gone unreported by the liberal Big Three networks The video and more143 Congress Investigating Obama Admin-Funded Campaign to Unseat Israeli PM144 State Department purged emails about 300,000 grant to anti-Netanyahu group Adam Kredo The Washington Free Beacon September 16, 2016 Congress on Friday launched a wide-ranging probe into a secret Obama administration-funded campaign to unseat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to information exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The probe comes on the heels of an internal government report determining that the State Department provided hundreds of thousands to an organization that plotted to unseat Netanyahu in the countrys 2015 election. Obama administration officials were found to have deleted emails145 from State Department accounts containing information about its relationship with OneVoice, the non-profit group that led the effort. OneVoice, which was awarded 465,000 in U.S. grants through 2014, has been under congressional investigation146 since 2015, when it was first accused of funneling some of that money to partisan political groups looking to unseat Netanyahu. This type of behavior by non-profit groups is prohibited under U.S. tax law. A group of nine leading lawmakers led by Sen. David Perdue R., Ga. are now formally petitioning the State Department to come clean about the effort and provide answers about how U.S. taxpayer dollars were permitted to be spent on an organization working against the elected leader of Americas closest Middle East ally, according to a readout of the investigation obtained by the Free Beacon. State Department officials failed to properly vet the OneVoice grant proposal because they failed to properly conduct an analysis of risks in the pre-award phase, the senators wrote in a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry. Unfortunately, it seems that inconsistency and apathy toward oversight of such grants at the State Department is not new. Our aid dollars should be going toward solving real problems, not contributing to the destabilization of allied governments. The lawmakers including Sens. Ted Cruz R., Texas, Mark Kirk R., Ill., Orrin Hatch R., Utah, Mike Lee R., Utah, and Johnny Isakson R., Ga. among others wrote that the State Department turned a blind eye to OneVoices highly partisan activities and failed to perform proper oversight about how U.S. funds were being spent by the group. State Department officials utterly failed to follow established procedures and guidelines to properly identify, mitigate, or guard against any risk that OneVoice would misuse these funds before, during, and after the grant period, the letter said. As a direct result of these failures, OneVoice was able to use the more than 300,000 grant to build campaign infrastructure and resources which later were deployed in support of a negative campaign against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his Likud Party, and the democratically elected coalition government of Israel during the 2015 Israeli parliamentary election. State Department officials were aware of OneVoices partisan activities, but still permitted the grant money to be awarded, according to the senators, who are pushing for the administration to take disciplinary action against the officials involved.

Now if only we could get Obama to reset his refugee and immigration policies Dave David French National Review September 16, 2016 If actions speak louder than words, then Barack Obama has been systematically admitting the failure of his own foreign policy. With the notable very notable exception of his Iran policy, his actions over the past year reveal an increasingly aggressive military approach to our foes and geopolitical rivals, along with increased military support for key allies. Just this week, the United States and Israel signed the largest military-assistance deal in American history, a ten-year, 38 billion pact that should help guarantee Israels qualitative military advantage in the Middle East for the foreseeable future. For all the pressure and tension between the Obama administration and the Netanyahu government, Obama is leaving office with no two-state solution and no peace deal but rather security assistance that will long outlast the memory of any political tension or rivalry. At the same time, American ground troops maintain their presence in Afghanistan and have slowly ramped back up in Iraq, with allied forces massing for a decisive battle for Mosul, a fight that could effectively push ISIS out of every major Iraqi population center. American special forces are engaged in Syria and Libya, and bombing raids are hitting terrorist targets from Afghanistan to Iraq to Syria to Somalia. In Europe, Obama has quadrupled military spending and bolstered American support for the Baltic states. The Washington Post characterized the joint NATO effort as pouring tanks, warplanes and soldiers into the region. In the other words, the 1980s called, and they have their foreign policy back. As the Post describes, Russian and Western officials make clear that they are settling into a confrontation that neither side expects to end quickly. Its difficult to overstate the gap between this new military reality and the hope and promise of the Obama candidacy. He was going to end wars. He was going to reset relations with Russia. Even as late as 2012, he was trumpeting the success of his approach. American troops were home from Iraq, Osama bin Laden was dead, and all seemed mainly quiet on the Russian front. While Obamas pacifism was always exaggerated he did, for example, order a surge in Afghanistan, waged stepped-up drone campaigns, and bombed the Qaddafi regime into oblivion, at the heart of his ideology was the notion that certain American actions created a series of legitimate grievances in the Muslim world and beyond. In other words, American actions had provided jihadists with pretexts for war and material for recruitment. By reversing course, decreasing our military footprint, and ending the most controversial of Bush-era programs, we could isolate the extremists, cultivate relationships with allegedly more reasonable Islamists witness the aggressive courtship of Egypts Muslim Brotherhood and of Libyan revolutionaries, and refocus American resources on domestic problems. The result was tragic. American withdrawal created a series of power vacuums largely filled by American enemies. By throwing away the Iraq victory, Obama created space not merely for the re-emergence of al-Qaeda in Iraq since renamed ISIS, he permitted Iran to exert ever greater levels of control even over our remaining Iraqi allies, and his light-footprint Libya campaign helped turn that nation into a cauldron of jihadist violence and unrest. A reset was essentially mandatory. And to the extent that Obama keeps ignoring the lessons of the very recent past, there will be more resets to come. By 2014, Obamas foreign policy was in a state of near-collapse. Russian forces invaded Ukraine, and ISIS launched a blitzkrieg from Syria that routed the Iraqi army, threatened Baghdad and Erbil, and initiated a genocide of Christians, Yazidis, and dissenting Muslims. By 2016, ISIS influence had spread across continents, and ISIS-inspired and ISIS-planned attacks had rocked the great cities of Europe and had even come here to the United States. So a reset was essentially mandatory. And to the extent that Obama keeps ignoring the lessons of the very recent past, there will be more resets to come More149 Image Source PeerayotLicense ShutterStock Image150 The post Jihad Report - September 16, 2016151 appeared first on Western Free Press152.  1  2 spshow-clips  3 spshow-clips  4  5  6 breaking20State20Department20announces20plan20to20bring20in20110,00020refugees20next20fiscal20year  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31 spshow-clips  32 spshow-clips  33 spshow-clips  34 spshow-clips  35  36  37  38  39  40  41 breaking20State20Department20announces20plan20to20bring20in20110,00020refugees20next20fiscal20year  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49 breaking20State20Department20announces20plan20to20bring20in20110,00020refugees20next20fiscal20year  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62 incart_river_index_topics  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99  100  101  102  103  104  105  106  107  108  109  110  111  112  113  114  115  116 mailto.SENATORREPRESENTATIVE,20show20that20AmericaWelcomes20by20supporting20increased20funds20to20resettle20refugees!20RefugeesWelcome  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152","homeless, affordable housing"

The success of Better Buffalo Fund projects like Bellamy projects will not only benefit this area but will have a positive ripple effect in adjoining neighborhoods as well. The 7.2 million Bellamy Commons received a 100,000 grant from the Better Buffalo Fund, part of Governor Cuomos 30 million Buffalo Billion initiative to encourage increased density and growth along transportation corridors and regenerate neighborhood commercial districts.

buffalo,Governor Hochul Announces $52M in Awards for Regional Clean Energy Hubs,2022-12-09T00:00:00Z,Gulf Oil & Gas,WNY,"As New York continues moving toward a green economy, community outreach and education is essential to ensuring all New Yorkers can participate in and benefit from this transition, Governor Hochul said. In true New York fashion, these organizations are coming together to help their fellow New Yorkers and ensure every community has the opportunity to thrive. My administration is proud to support their efforts through this 52 million investment, and I applaud their leadership in helping New York communities transition to a clean energy future.The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority partnered with community-based organizations to establish the Hubs and provide a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to ensure that all New Yorkers have equitable access to the benefits of the states clean energy transition. Each Hub will be composed of a network of organizations in each of the states economic development regions to be responsible for establishing and fostering partnerships, over the next four years, in their area to deliver services at the community level and offer new ways to coordinate and promote clean energy outreach, engagement and education services throughout their communities. Organizations with experience in providing outreach and education services in clean energy and energy efficiency, and integrating those with social services, housing, economic development, healthand training, were encouraged to participate.Awards were given to the following organizations to establish a Regional Clean Energy Hub in their regionCapital DistrictAffordable Housing Partnership, 3,624,546Central New YorkCentral New York Regional Planning and Development Board, 3,317,994Finger LakesClimate Solutions Accelerator of the Genesee-Fingers Lakes Region, 3,835,014Long IslandCornell Cooperative Extension of Nassau County, 4,000,000Mid-HudsonCornell Cooperative Extension of Dutchess County, 4,074,389Mohawk ValleyCornell Cooperative Extension of Oneida County, 3,302,944New York CityAssociation for Energy Affordability, Inc., 8,926,027 Bronx and BrooklynNeighborhood Housing Services of Queens, 6,623,725 Queens and Staten IslandWE ACT for Environmental Justice, Inc., 3,837,067 ManhattanNorth CountryAdirondack North Country Association, 4,099,404Southern TierCornell Cooperative Extension of Tompkins County, 3,516,454Western New YorkPeople United for Sustainable Housing, Inc. PUSH Buffalo, 3,499,034New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, The Regional Clean Energy Hubs will connect the dots for New Yorkers who are seeking resources to reduce energy costs, make their homes more energy efficient, participate in clean energy job training or apply for new jobs. The Hubs will also be critical in engaging with local communities to address any existing barriers faced when accessing the programs to ensure all New Yorkers are involved and can fully participate in a green economy.Long Island Power Authority Chief Executive Officer Thomas Falcone said, As New York transitions to a clean economy, all communities must have access to information and resources on the benefits of the clean energy transition. These new clean energy hubs will serve as a launchpad for local customer outreach, engagement, and educational initiatives to help connect customers with programs and incentives. I commend the Governor for her steadfast leadership.The Hubs were selected through a competitive process to advance an inclusive green economy in New York State that focuses on- Delivering community-based engagement, outreach and consumer awareness of clean energy technologies and opportunities- Coordinating programs and funding resources to increase participation in clean energy projects- Conducting equitable stakeholder engagement to incorporate community perspectives and increase public input into the New York State Energy Research and Development Authoritys program, policy, and strategy development- Increasing local capacity to engage with community residents about clean energy policy, technologies, and opportunities- Advancing diversity in the clean energy workforce by working with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, trade unions, and training providers to help clean energy businesses connect with and hire individuals from priority populations or underserved communities, and increase the number and diversity of participating contractors in the clean energy sector- Establishing strategic partnerships across the clean energy ecosystem in a particular region to benefit disadvantaged or underserved communities and- Advancing local projects that address regional barriers that prevent disadvantaged communities from participating in or benefiting from the clean energy economy.The development of the Hubs initiative was the result of a co-design effort led by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and the Energy Democracy Alliance, which included participation of more than 30 community-based organizations from across New York State. The co-design approach helped to ensure that the perspectives of those working in communities to address the needs of the most vulnerable New Yorkers was informing the development of this important initiative.Funding for the Hubs initiative is part of New Yorks nearly 1 billion investment to increase access to energy efficiency and clean energy solutions for low-to-moderate income residents and communities, which is supported by the Clean Energy Fund and utilities. Its also funded through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and is part of New Yorks broader set of initiatives to address the clean energy needs of disadvantaged communities. Long Island Power Authority is partnering with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority in support of the Long Island Clean Energy Hub. Previously, 36 million was made available for the establishment of Hubs in 10 economic development regions in the state, however, two additional Hubs in New York City were funded to help address the unique needs in this diverse and highly populated area of the state - bringing the total program funding amount to 52 million.This builds on the New York State Energy Research and Development Authoritys related equity efforts, including making 6 million available to support 150 Climate Justice Fellowship opportunities for individuals across New York State residing in historically disadvantaged communities or from priority populations.Executive Director of the Adirondack North Country Association Elizabeth Cooper said, The Adirondack North Country Association is honored to be partnering with Cornell Cooperative Extension of Jefferson and St. Lawrence Counties and SUNY Canton CREST Career Ready Education and Success Training to serve as the Clean Energy Hub for the North Country region. This initiative is critical for helping North Country residents and small businesses save money on energy bills and access clean energy opportunities and jobs. Our teams long-standing community relationships, extensive experience advancing clean energy programs, and focus on equity and inclusion will support a strong regional Hub that increases engagement in clean energy initiatives across northern New York.Executive Director of the Affordable Housing Partnership Susan Cotner said, The Capital Region Hub looks forward to connecting residents with NYSERDA programs to assist with clean energy upgrades for their homes as well as to job opportunities in the growing clean energy field. We applaud NYSERDAs approach in creating regional Clean Energy Hubs that are composed of community-based organizations with deep connections to households of all incomes throughout the region.Director of Advocacy and Organizing at the Association for Energy Affordability, Inc. Betta Broad said, To achieve our nation-leading climate goals, all New Yorkers must be empowered to take action and priority must be given to low-income communities and those disproportionately impacted by pollution and climate change. We are excited to help residents and businesses in the Bronx and Brooklyn access clean energy solutions that lower energy costs, create energy efficient, healthier buildings, and a more sustainable planet.Energy Program Manager of the Central New York Regional Planning and Development Board Chris Carrick said, The Central New York Regional Planning and Development Board CNY RPDB is excited to work with its partner organizations the Alliance for a Green Economy and Greater Syracuse Works to provide clean energy education and services throughout Central New York. With the support of NYSERDAs Regional Clean Energy Hubs program, our team will work with community stakeholders to grow our regions clean energy economy, create family-supporting jobs and reduce burdens for vulnerable populations as we advance the goals of the states nation-leading Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.Climate Solutions Accelerator of the Genesee-Fingers Lakes Region Abigail McHugh-Grifa said, We are proud to be part of a cohort of Regional Clean Energy Hubs dedicated to making clean energy services, technologies, and jobs more accessible for New York State residents and small businesses. NYSERDAs local approach to this work allows us to mobilize existing and new partners in our region who are closest to the needs and values of the residents we serve.Environment and Energy Resource Educator, Cornell Cooperative Extension of Dutchess County Collin Adkins said, We feel honored and privileged to continue serving the Mid-Hudson Region to help our communities reduce their energy burden, access clean and renewable energy sources, and make informed energy decisions. With a dedicated team of Energy Advisors hosted by a coalition of Cornell Cooperative Extension CCE Associations, the proven track records of our subcontracted organizations including Sustainable Westchester, New Yorkers for Clean Power, and UHope Consulting, and a growing network of volunteers and partner organizations, were excited to help the region and New York State meet our energy goals.Executive Director, Cornell Cooperative Extension of Nassau County, Gregory Sandor said, Cornell Cooperative Extension of Nassau County CCE Nassau is honored to serve as the lead contractor for the NYSERDA Regional Clean Energy Hub for the Long Island Region. We believe our coalition of proven renewable energy and community engagement leaders institutions, universities, associations and business leaders makes up a superb team. Our Long Island Clean Energy Hub is committed to providing solutions that will make a tangible difference in our communities and provide measurable results.Executive Director, Cornell Cooperative Extension of Oneida County, Mary Beth McEwen said, Cornell Cooperative Extension of Oneida County is extremely pleased to have been chosen by NYSERDA to serve as the Regional Clean Energy Hub in the Mohawk Valley. We look forward to connecting with community members, small businesses, and affordable housing owners about the benefits of clean energy, ways to reduce energy costs, and how to make more informed energy decisions. Through education and community outreach, we are investing in the people of our communities and in the future of New York State.Senior Resource Educator, Cornell Cooperative Extension of Tompkins County, Karím Beers said, We are delighted to participate in this initiative that reduces carbon emissions and helps New Yorkers, especially those with limited material resources, save money and participate meaningfully in shaping our collective clean energy future.Executive Director, Neighborhood Housing Services of Queens, Yoselin Genao-Estrella said, We look forward to uplifting Queens, and Staten Island residents as our communities navigate a post-pandemic society. We are hopeful to support NYC achieve CLCPA goals in a holistic, equitable, and just approach, centering residents needs first in a clean energy future.Director of Community Energy, PUSH Buffalo Natalie Rodriguez said, PUSH Buffalo is pleased to be a part of the Regional Clean Energy Hubs Initiative. As the lead of Western New York Regional Clean Energy Hub WNY Hubs, we continue our commitment to build resilient communities and provide holistic and inclusive clean energy in Erie, Niagara, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, and Allegany counties. Our focus on disadvantaged populations will help strengthen, support, and create a healthier environment and sustainable workforce for frontline communities across the region.Co-founder and Executive Director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice Peggy Shepard said, Disadvantaged communities are on the frontline of the climate crisis, where they are getting hit hardest by the effects of extreme weather like flooding and heat, but they are also facing many obstacles to improving their homes and entering a high-quality green job workforce. WE ACT and our partners are excited to lead NYSERDAs Regional Clean Energy Hub in Manhattan, specifically to serve low-income communities and communities of color in multifamily buildings that are a major source of poor air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. We are looking forward to moving our City towards a more efficient, cleaner, and just future.Steering Committee Member of the New York Energy Democracy Alliance Adam Flint said, By centering the voices and needs of disadvantaged communities in its design and implementation, the Regional Clean Energy Hub program is a victory for the energy democracy movement, and a crucial tool to achieve New Yorks climate and equity goals. We congratulate NYSERDA for taking a big first step in the cultural shift underway at the agency whereby this program, which was first conceived of by professional disadvantaged community advocates, has become a reality through a process of codesign.New York States Nation-Leading Climate PlanNew York States nation-leading climate agenda is the most aggressive climate and clean energy initiative in the nation, calling for an orderly and just transition to clean energy that creates jobs and continues fostering a green economy as New York State recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. Enshrined into law through the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, New York is on a path to achieve its mandated goal of a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, including 70 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, and to reach economy wide carbon neutrality. It builds on New Yorks unprecedented investments to ramp-up clean energy including over 35 billion in 120 large-scale renewable and transmission projects across the state, 6.8 billion to reduce buildings emissions, 1.8 billion to scale up solar, more than 1 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over 1.6 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. Combined, these investments are supporting more than 165,000 jobs in New Yorks clean energy sector in 2021, a 2,100 percent growth in the distributed solar sector since 2011 and a commitment to develop 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Under the Climate Act, New York will build on this progress and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent from 1990 levels by 2050, while ensuring that at least 35 percent with a goal of 40 percent of the benefits of clean energy investments are directed to disadvantaged communities, and advance progress towards the states 2025 energy efficiency target of reducing on-site energy consumption by 185 trillion BTUs of end-use energy savings.",affordable housing

This funding will be awarded to eleven food security organizations which support a network of more than 2,600 New York State food pantries, soup kitchens and shelter sites that are particularly busy during the holiday season. Together, they will provide nearly 400 million emergency meals to assist those in need annually, while providing a boost to New York farmers.As families gather to celebrate Thanksgiving, we know some may need a little extra help to put food on the table thats why these investments are so critical, Governor Hochul said. New Yorkers always help our neighbors when theyre in a tough spot, and our efforts to provide food for those in need will deliver more than 400 million meals in the coming months.Funding has been made available to the following organizations as part of an initiative partnering with the State Department of Health and the State Department of Agriculture and Markets to assist New York State residents and farmersFood Bank for New York CityRegional Food Bank of Northeastern New York, Inc.FeedMore WNY, Inc.Catholic Charities Food Bank of the Southern TierFood Bank of Central New YorkFeeding Westchester, Inc.Long Island Cares, IncIsland Harvest, LTDCity HarvestUnited Way of New York CityFoodlink, INC.These organizations will distribute funding to more than 2,600 sites as sub-awards for food assistance services, or as direct allocations of additional food. This includes purchasing additional food, produced by New York State farmers, for their emergency food assistance member agencies.Food banks will be able to use these to host food assistance activities, including popular distribution programs run during the holiday season.New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said, No one deserves to go hungry. Hunger can cause stress to the body and mind and can result in malnutrition, inability to concentrate, anxiety, and depression. This investment will give more New Yorkers consistent access to safe and nutritious food that can lead to better health outcomes. The Department remains committed to fighting hunger and promoting nutrition security across this State.New York State Agriculture Commissioner Richard A. Ball said, Thanks to Governor Hochuls continued support of our mission to strengthen the food system, increase the demand for New York agricultural products, and ensure food access for all New Yorkers, we have made incredible progress in connecting our farmers and our underserved communities, especially since the pandemic. The additional funding being provided to our partners at food banks across New York State today will allow them to purchase more, healthy local food to provide to our families in need and will provide a continued market for our farmers.Governor Hochul has made combatting food insecurity and supporting New York agriculture a priority for her administration. Under Governor Kathy Hochuls leadership, the New York State Department of Health and the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets administers several programs that support increasing food and nutrition security across the StateThe Hunger Prevention and Nutrition Assistance Program supports a network of more than 2,600 emergency food providers who distribute healthy food and fresh produce to individuals who request assistance.The Nourish New York Initiative, administered by the Department in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Markets, provides funding to support the purchase and distribution of New York State grown or produced items, including dairy products and produce. Since its launch, Nourish New York has supported the purchase of over 118 million pounds of New York food products, providing a boost to New York farmers and more than 99 million meals to those in need.The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children WIC serves more than 425,000 individuals through breastfeeding support, nutrition education, supplemental nutritious food benefits, and health care referrals.The Commodity Supplemental Food Program offers free, nutritious foods to adults aged 60 and older. Approximately 36,000 older adults participate in the program monthly. During the summer, participants receive additional benefits for fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets through the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program, available in New York City and Long Island. The goal is to improve the health of low-income individuals at least 60 by supplementing their diets with nutritious United States Department of Agriculture foods.The Child and Adult Care Food Program is a nutrition education and meal reimbursement program that helps providers serve nutritious and safely prepared meals and snacks to children and adults in daycare settings. The program is funded through the United States Department of Agriculture and continues New Yorks commitment to promote the health and well-being of its residents. All children and adults who attend childcare centers, community-based adult centers, afterschool programs, homeless shelters, and family daycare programs receive meals.Food Access Expansion Grant Program provides 10 million to help increase food access for New Yorkers living in areas without grocery stores and without options for healthy, affordable food. It provides infrastructure funding to support the development and expansion of supermarkets, food cooperatives, permanent farm stands, and other retail food stores in underserved regions of the state while also increasing markets for New York farmers.Regional School Food Infrastructure Grant Program, which provides 50 million over five years to support regional cooking facilities that will facilitate the use of fresh New York State farm products in meal preparation for K-12 school children.FreshConnect Program and the FreshConnect Fresh2You program, which now doubles the buying power for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP recipients at farmers markets across New York State. The initiative provides eligible New Yorkers with a dollar-for-dollar match of up to 50 per day at participating farmers markets, which allows families in need to purchase more healthy food, including produce, dairy, eggs and meats.Farmers Market Nutrition Program FMNP promotes local producers by expanding their sales at farmers markets and farm stands and fosters healthy communities through the consumption of locally grown foods. Eligible consumers are provided with coupons to use for fresh fruits and vegetables at the more than 700 market locations, including farmers markets, farm stands, and mobile market stops participating in the FMNP, supplying healthy homegrown foods to communities across New York.SNAP-Ed Funding Program, which is administered in coordination with the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, aims to make local produce more available and accessible to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP eligible communities while sourcing local produce and providing nutrition education through Community Garden and Food Box programs.Farm-to-School program connects schools with local farms and food producers to strengthen local agriculture and improve student health. The program provides financial, technical, and promotional assistance to schools, farms, distributors, and other supporting organizations to bring more local, nutritious, seasonally varied meals to New York students.The 30 Percent New York State Initiative builds on the Farm-to-School program by increasing the reimbursement schools receive for lunches from 5.9 cents per meal to 25 cents per meal for any district that ensures their school lunches are made up of at least 30 percent eligible New York produced and processed products, providing healthier meal options for students and additional markets for farmers.State Senator Roxanne J. Persaud, Chair of the Committee on Social Services said, By securing an additional 27.5 million in funding for critical food security programs, we are helping to ease the burden on families who struggle to provide for their most basic needs. I thank Governor Hochul for prioritizing our most vulnerable populations and for continuing the efforts of this legislature to combat food insecurity in our communities.Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, Chair of the Committee on Children and Families said, Food insecurity impacts people across every corner of our state, this funding will go a long way to lessen that reality and ensure no one has to wonder where, when, or how they will have their next meal. I am grateful to the Governor for her leadership on this issue and look forward to continuing to invest in the needs of everyday New Yorkers.In addition, the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets administers the federally funded New York Food for New York Families program, providing nearly 50 million to partner food banks and food service organizations to implement projects that purchase New York-grown food products and distribute them to underserved communities. It also provides technical assistance to help growers sell into the New York Food for New York Families program.On the Department of Health website, you can find more information on the Hunger Prevention and Nutrition Assistance Program, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and the Child and Adult Care Food Program.","homeless, soup kitchen"

buffalo,Trump's Eviction Moratorium Could set a Dangerous Precedent,2020-09-02T00:00:00Z,The Volokh Conspiracy,WNY,"The income cutoff of 99,000 for an individual taxpayer is far above the national poverty line2, and indeed far above the median national household income of 61,9373. which includes numerous multi-person households. The requirement that the eviction would likely render the individual homelessor force the individual to move into and live in close quarters in a new congregate or shared living setting could potentially apply to any situation where the evicted person ends up living in a new home with at least one other person. Having a roommate including a family member surely counts as a shared living setting. Thus, the measure would protect from potential eviction large numbers of people who are clearly not poor, and would not end up homeless if evicted.Such sweeping action by the executive normally at least requires authorization by Congress. As co-blogger Josh Blackman4 explains, the claimed authorization here is 42 CFR Section 70.2 a regulation5 that gives the Director of the CDC the power to take such measures to prevent such spread of the communicable diseases as heshe deems reasonably necessary, including inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, and destruction of animals or articles believed to be sources of infection. The CDC can take such measures anywhere it deems local and state regulations to be insufficient to limit the spread of disease across state borders.Section 70.2 is itself just a regulation, not a law enacted by Congress so there may be some question as to whether it itself has legislative authorization. Assuming Section 70.2 does have such authorization, the Administration may be overreaching when it claims that it permits a sweeping nationwide eviction moratorium.As Josh notes, the possible measures listed in the regulationinspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, and destruction of animals or articles believed to be sources of infection are all relatively narrowly targeted policies focused on specific sources of infection, not wide-ranging nationwide regulations that apply regardless of how much danger there is in the particular location. Esjudem generis6, a standard canon of legal interpretation, requires that a list of items in a law should be interpreted as being of the same kind as others on list. Here, everything on the list seems to be relatively limited in scope. Thus, the regulation only permits narrowly targeted, localized restrictions.On the other hand, the administration can argue that these specific examples are just meant to be illustrative and all they really have in common with each other is that they are all examples of measures that might be thought reasonably necessary to limit the spread of disease. On that theory, Section 70.2 would allow the CDC to impose almost any regulation it wanted, so long as there is some minimally plausible argument that it would limit the spread of a communicable disease.And note that, under the text of the regulation, the CDC need not prove that the regulations in question really are reasonably necessary or that state restrictions really are insufficient. They need only assert deem that such is the case.This broad interpretation of the regulation would give the executive the power to restrict almost any type of activity. Pretty much any economic transaction or movement of people and goods could potentially spread disease in some way. Nor is that authority limited to particularly deadly diseases such as Covid-19. It could just as readily apply to virtually any other communicable disease, such as the flu or even the common cold.Every year, thousands of people die because of the flu, and restrictions on mobility or on economic and social activity could be seen as reasonable ways to limit its spread. 42 CFR Section 70.17 on which the definition of disease in Section 70.2 is based in fact defines communicable diseases as illnesses due to infectious agents or their toxic products, which may be transmitted from a reservoir to a susceptible host either directly as from an infected person or animal or indirectly through the agency of an intermediate plant or animal host, vector, or the inanimate environment. Notice that this applies to any disease spread by infectious agents, regardless of severity. The flu and the common cold clearly qualify!If Trump can use this authority to impose a nationwide eviction moratorium, Joe Biden or some other future president could use it to impose a nationwide mask mandate, a nationwide lockdown, or just about any other restriction of any activity that could potentially reduce the spread of the flu, the common cold, or any other disease.Such virtually limitless executive authority to impose restrictions and mandates would make a hash of the separation of powers, enabling the president to circumvent Congresss authority on a massive scale. It also would completely undermine any semblance of nondelegation restrictions on grants of power to the executive. If Section 70.2 is authorized by Congress and has the broad scope the administration claims, it would virtually gut nondelegation. If Congress can delegate the power to suppress virtually any activity of any kind, so long as the CDC claims that doing so is reasonably necessary to reduce the spread of disease, it is hard to see how any meaningful limits on delegation would remain.There are similar problems with the administrations ultrabroad interpretations of statutes delegating power over immigration8 and trade9. But extending such arguments to the suppression of purely domestic economic and social activity further exacerbates the danger.The administrations position threatens federalism, as much as separation of powers. If the executive can suppress pretty much any type of local activity so long as the CDC claims that it risks transmitting contagious diseases and state law is insufficient, it can intrude in numerous areas of public policy that would otherwise be left to state or local control. At the very least, displacement of state or local power by the the feds would require congressional legislation, not just executive whim. Conservatives who may think such power can safely be entrusted to Trump will not be happy the next time a Democrat wields it, as could well happen as soon as next January.A sweeping nationwide eviction moratorium is also a massive infringement on private property rights. Landlords may be stuck holding the bag for numerous tenants who refuse to pay. This is yet another addition to the Trump administrations already terribl10e record on property rights.Josh Blackman posits11 that Congress will eventually enact legislation compensating landlords. But it is far from clear that will actually happen, and especially if it will happen fast enough to keep many smaller landlords from falling into dire financial straits. The same goes for efforts to recoup unpaid rent from tenants when the moratorium ends.Moreover, whoever wins the presidential election might have strong political incentives to extend the moratorium for months to come. After all, the broad power implied by the administrations interpretation of Section 70.2 does not impose any time limits, or any limitations based on the severity of the disease threat the regulations are supposedly combating. Even after a Covid vaccine is discovered and deployed, the administration could potentially argue that continuing the moratorium is necessary, because the vaccine may not be 100 effective, and thus some disease risk remainsLandlords could potentially recoup their losses by filing lawsuits under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In my view, this sort of measure probably should be considered a taking. But courts have been reluctant12 to rule that state-imposed rent moratoria are takings, and the same deference is likely to be applied to a federal policy.The administrations immigration restrictions are currently being challenged on nondelegation grounds13, and similar lawsuits will likely be filed against the eviction moratorium. Hopefully, the plaintiffs will prevail in both cases. That may be the best prospect for overturning this measure in court.Alternatively, the canon against interpreting statutes in ways that raise constitutional problems will lead courts to interpret Section 70.2 and its authorizing statute narrowly, thereby invalidating the moratorium, but preserving the statutes and regulations as sources of authority for more narrowly targeted public health measures.Some might argue that this action will not set a dangerous precedent because the authority to impose moratoria and other restrictions created by Section 70.2 is given to the head of the CDC, an expert agency that is supposed to be guided by scientific evidence, not political or ideological imperatives. But the CDC is hardly immune to political pressure from the president and other politicians, as shown by a variety of instances14 where the Trump administration has bent the agency to its will15. It is likely that political pressure played a significant role in this policy, as well. Moreover, even the most expert bureaucrats often have political agendas of their own. Rarely, if ever, is there such a thing as public health policy determined purely by technical scientific considerations without reference to morality or ideology.Finally, it is worth noting that this sweeping moratorium is unnecessary, as well as illegal. There is no massive eviction crisis in the United States. To the contrary, eviction rates have been below normal levels since the start of the Coronavirus crisis in March, as was also true during previous recessions16. And that has been the case even in areas where there are no local eviction moratoria. Barring extreme malfeasance of some kind, most landlords do not want to evict tenants during an economic crisis, if only because they know it will be hard to get new ones able to pay as much or more.If the federal government nonetheless imposes sweeping eviction moratoria, that will incentivize landlords to raise rents or take on fewer tenants in the future, in order to guard against such policies. That will predictably reduce the available housing stock for tenants, especially the poor. The same goes if landlords have to leave the industry because they go bankrupt or otherwise lose large amounts of money.To the extent that some kind government assistance for needy tenants is desirable during an economic crisis, it is best-provided in the more targeted form of subsidies for poor tenants who otherwise cannot pay, not sweeping eviction moratoria that apply to millions of non-poor tenants, and leave landlords holding the bag.UPDATE I have made a few minor additions to this post.  1  2 38rctjamp38qamp38esrcsamp38sourcewebamp38cdamp38cadrjaamp38uact8amp38ved2ahUKEwjXkNuGocvrAhUphHIEHUuEDOEQFjAAegQIBBABamp38urlhttps3A2F2Faspe.hhs.gov2Fpoverty-guidelinesamp38usgAOvVaw3kZ5BplStiTJtaiW1ZWXLD  3  4  5  6  7 38height800amp38iframetrueamp38def_id5061ca87e892937e109dd3305550587aamp38term_occur999amp38term_srcTitle42ChapterISubchapterFPart7070.2  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15 185a49801f8b  16",homeless

Newly elected Wisconsin state Sens. Julian Bradley and Eric Wimberger and Rep. Tony Kurtz said they started to circulate a resolution to block expanding the court beyond nine judges. While some other states have passed simple resolutions on the issue, their plan, dubbed Wisconsin Keep 9 Resolution, calls for a constitutional convention to debate an amendment that would require nine states. 69 California Parents Start Petition to End Absurd School Mask Mandates70 Gavin Newsom is fighting for his political life and as a result has been making all kinds of overtures to the people of California  from a new round of stimulus checks to free school meals for all to new funding for homeless programs.

The mainstream media all too often gladly accepts it as gospel, then pushes the same narrative to the public. But things arent always what they seem, OutKick founder Clay Travis says. They narrowly managed to avoid an all-time low Game 1 NBA Finals rating, Clay says, referring to the Suns-Bucks series. In the bubble last year, they posted a tiny number. They managed to just get over the hurdle of that number in Game 1 on Tuesday. 75 Cotton Calls on Biden to Publicly Condemn Critical Race Theory After Admin Promotes Radical Group76 Sen.

You may recall the much-ballyhooed plot to supposedly kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last year. Arrests were made in October of 2020, with the claim being that the FBI had stopped the kidnapping plot as well as a plan to overthrow the government. After it came out in the weeks following the bust that one of the participants was anti-Trump and a Black Lives Matter supporter, the story quickly died down. All of this was intertwined at the time with the politics of Whitmers controversial COVID policies. Earlier in the same year, there had been demonstrations at the states capital that drew lots of press attention and condemnation. The insinuation pushed by the media was that those demonstrations had provoked the kidnapping plot. But now, a big curveball is being thrown into the mix regarding what actually happened. Apparently, the FBI didnt just have informants within the group where the arrests were made. Rather, FBI operatives played a key role in the planning of the entire ordeal and were also seemingly instrumental in birthing the plot. 89 Lebron James Bombs at Box Office After Going Woke and Simping for China90 Amongst failing domestic sales of Space Jam A New Legacy, the movie, and its big star LeBron James, are expected to take an even bigger hit after China has stated that it wont allow the movie to air in their country. 91 McCarthy Pulls His Five Republicans From Riot Commission After Pelosi Rejects Conservative Reps92 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthys five choices to sit on the select committee that will investigate the riot at the Capitol on January 6.

The decision states that corporate bans on religious or political symbols are legitimate if employers wish to present a neutral image towards customers or to prevent social disputes. The judgment is consistent with previous determinations by the Luxembourg-based court, informally known as the European Court of Justice ECJ, that bans on religious symbols at the workplace are not inherently discriminatory  provided they apply equally to all religions. The significance of the ECJs decision on the headscarf  arguably the most visible symbol of political Islam in Europe  cannot be overstated by striking a balance between religious liberty and entrepreneurial freedom, the court has effectively blocked a back-door effort to enshrine Sharia law in European labor law. 125 Germanys Spiegel Claims Muhammad Cartoonist Kurt Westergaard Responsible for Jihad Terror126 By Robert Spencer It is a basic principle that is being obscured if you insult me and I hit you, the responsibility lies entirely with me.

Morawiecki explained that the best policy towards the EU was euro-realism, which entailed the unilateral defense of Polish interests on one hand negotiating funds to their maximum size, and on the other hand the defense of those areas in which Poland and other EU states did not agree in terms of handing over competencies to European institutions. 139 Radical No-Go Zone Imam Claims Swedish Flag for Heretics140 A radical Islamist imam in the Malmö no-go zone of Rosengrd has claimed that Muslims carrying Swedish flags are heretics as the flag contains a Christian cross.

They took him to trial without defense or lawyer or anything, Troyas mother Raisa Gonzalez told Reuters after witnessing his sentencing in what she called a collective trial of around a dozen people. 166 Pop Star Pitbull Calls on Jeff Bezos to Provide Aid to Cuban People Wake Up Because This is About Freedom and Human Rights167 Cuban-American rap mega star Pitbull is calling on wealthy American business leaders, particularly Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, to provide aid to the Cuban people, thousands of whom have taken to the streets of the island nation in recent days to protest the lack of basic human necessities and to call for the end of six decades of Communist rule. Pitbull posted an Instagram video in which he made an impassioned plea for help. 168 At Least 30 Migrants Escape Italian Reception Centre After Setting Fire169 At least 30 migrants escaped an Italian reception centre in Pozzallo after some of them allegedly set fire to mattresses in protest. The fire started on Sunday afternoon in the Sicilian town and saw at least 30 of the 80 or so migrants at the facility use the chaos of the blaze to escape the facility. 170 Crying Toddler and Barefoot Children Are Brought Ashore as Around 100 Migrants Arrive in the UK Today After Number Crossing the Channel in 2021 Already Hit a Record Yearly High of 8,452171 At least five children including a crying toddler were among nearly 100 migrants brought ashore in Dover by Border Force today as French warships and UK vessels have been active again in the Channel after more than 700 people crossed from mainland Europe on Monday and Tuesday. At least 85 and as many as 100 migrants are thought to have arrived on the southern coast of England so far today, with individual arrivals revealing they paid 3,000 for places on dinghies as cynical people-smuggling gangs take advantage of flat seas and clear skies. A group of four men of African origin wearing lifejackets and facemasks disembarked from the Border Force vessel Speedwell at around 2pm, and were escorted by immigration enforcement officials onto the harbour edge for processing at Dover Marina in Kent. Comment Article dated July 21, 2021. 172 Five Boats Carrying 171 Migrants Arrive on Lampedusa173 AGRIGENTO  After a week of pause due to rough seas, five boats carrying 171 migrants arrived on Tuesday evening on the Italian island of Lampedusa. The first was carrying 17 men from Tunisia and Guinea, tracked down about four miles away from the coast by the Coast Guard, followed by one carrying 18 people including five women of sub-Saharan origins. They were also on a boat that had been intercepted by an Italian Financial Police motorboat, just over a nautical mile from the port. Over the night, three more boats landed one large one carrying 109 migrants including two women and about 30 minors, almost all of whom unaccompanied. This was followed by two smaller boats one carrying 13 Tunisians and the other 14, including one minor. All were taken to the Imbriacola hotspot after an initial health examination at the Favarolo wharf. 174 France is Making a Mockery of UK Furious Tories Accuse Priti Patel of Throwing Good Money After Bad With 54m Anglo-French Migrant Patrol Deal175 as ex-Border Force chief officer says UK is simply operating a collection service in Channel Priti Patel was eviscerated by her own Tory colleagues over the Channel migrant crisis today as they demanded she get tough with France and stop being fobbed off with excuses for inaction amid record numbers crossing to Britain. The Home Secretary was taken to task by MPs this morning as she admitted that record numbers of refugees were crossing the English Channel but insisted that French authorities were trying to stop them. Ms Patel last night agreed to pay France 54million to see anti-migrant police numbers more than doubled to 200, a fee almost twice the 28million agreed with Paris to achieve the same objective in November. 176 France Migrant With Long Rap Sheet Attacks Man Over Cigarette177 An African illegal alien with a lengthy criminal history has been charged with attacking a man who refused to give him a cigarette in France, according to reports. The incident unfolded on July 17 in the commune of Bourges when a 40-year-old migrant from Chad asked a man for a smoke. When the victim declined the request, the suspect allegedly punched him and pulled a knife. 178 Germany The Young Migrant Who Killed Three Women is Not Criminally Responsible, Expects Says179 According to psychiatric reports, the Somali refugee, who in June stabbed three women and injured seven others in Würzburg, Germany, was probably deranged because of his mental health problems and therefore cannot be prosecuted. An investigating judge in the Bavarian city ordered the 24-year-old man to be placed in a psychiatric facility. Whether religious beliefs played a role in the June 25 act remains unclear, according to the Bavarian Criminal Bureau and the Munich Public Prosecutors Office. According to the toxicological report, the man was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Neither of the two mobile phones contained propaganda material or extremist content. There is also no indication that the attacker had an accomplice or that anyone else knew about his action in advance. 180 Greek Police Prepare Criminal Case on Migrant Smuggling181 ATHENS, Greece  Greek authorities on the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos say they are drawing up a criminal case, including on charges of espionage, against 10 people, all foreign nationals, for allegedly helping migrants enter the country illegally. Police in Lesbos said on Monday the investigation had been ongoing for several months and was being carried out in cooperation with Greeces intelligence service and anti-terrorism task force. No charges have been brought and no suspects have been publicly identified. 182 Lithuania Adopts Law Restricting Migrant Rights183 Lithuania on Wednesday adopted a law that restricts migrants rights and speeds up asylum claims, following a spike in arrivals from Africa and the Middle East via Belarus. President Gitanas Nauseda signed off on the legislation but called it flawed and asked for parliament to amend it later this year. 184 On Migrants, Its One Hypocritical EU Rule for Lithuania and Another for Bogeyman Viktor Orban185 Lithuanias foreign minister posts dire threats of deportation to asylum seekers in English, Arabic, and Kurdish, but two-faced EU leaders, who pile on when Hungary does similar, are now sending border forces in support. When European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen fronted up in Vilnius a couple of weeks ago, her decision to lend enthusiastic support to the Lithuanians in their bid to stem the flow of migrants across the border from neighbouring Belarus was a remarkable change of approach. Ever keen to roll out the heavily armed soldiers that comprise Frontex  the EUs border and coast guard force whose offers of help are most often rebuffed  von der Leyen said personnel would be deployed not just to Lithuania but to Latvia, which also borders Belarus, to help repel illegal migrants. 186 Danish Parties Want to Grant Polish Women Free Abortions187 The Red-Green Alliance and the Social Liberal Party want the Danish state to earmark DKK 20 million 3.2 million over four years to help Polish women have an abortion in Denmark, Danish Radio reported. In a cross-aisle collaboration, the proposal was backed by the liberal-conservative Venstre party, currently the largest one in opposition. The idea behind the proposal is to alleviate Polands strict abortion legislation, which following a spate of tightenings only allows abortion if the pregnancy is due to incest or rape, or if the womans life is in danger. 188 Miley Cyrus Tells Young Fans to Ask Daddy To Buy Them Merchandise Featuring I Heart Dick Slogan189 Pop star Miley Cyrus has told her young fans to ask Daddy to buy them her new clothing merchandise, which includes the words i heart DICK alongside spraying droplets meant to represent semen.

The law, which was passed by Hungarys National Assembly last month, ensured that sex education in schools must not be aimed at promoting homosexuality or changing gender, according to ruling party Fidesz. 192  1  2  3 462218  4 462204  5 462200  6 462162  7 462168  8 462172  9 462176  10 462212  11 462248  12 462216  13 462246  14 462202  15 462214  16 462198  17 462170  18 462220  19 462210  20 462190  21 462244  22 462254  23 462184  24 462192  25 462152  26 462238  27 462206  28 462140  29 462258  30 462143  31 462232  32 462174  33 462138  34 462164  35 462158  36 462166  37 462228  38 462226  39 462234  40 462252  41 462236  42 462141  43 462178  44 462242  45 462146  46 462262  47 462260  48 462139  49 462240  50 462180  51 462264  52 462160  53 462256  54 462250  55 462224  56 462156  57 462222  58 462194  59 462230  60 462148  61 462154  62 462150  63 462196  64 462188  65 462182  66  67 topheadline  68  69 topheadline  70  71 topheadline  72  73 topheadline  74  75 topheadline  76  77 topheadline  78  79 topheadline  80  81 topheadline  82  83 topheadline  84  85 topheadline  86  87 topheadline  88  89 topheadline  90  91 topheadline  92  93 topheadline  94  95 topheadline  96  97 topheadline  98  99 topheadline  100  101 topheadline  102  103 topheadline  104  105 topheadline  106  107 topheadline  108  109 topheadline  110  111 topheadline  112  113 topheadline  114  115 topheadline  116  117 topheadline  118  119 topheadline  120  121 topheadline  122  123 topheadline  124  125 topheadline  126  127 topheadline  128  129 topheadline  130  131 topheadline  132  133 topheadline  134  135 topheadline  136  137 topheadline  138  139 topheadline  140  141 topheadline  142  143 topheadline  144  145 topheadline  146  147 topheadline  148  149 topheadline  150  151 topheadline  152  153 topheadline  154  155 topheadline  156  157  158 topheadline  159  160 topheadline  161  162 topheadline  163  164 topheadline  165  166 topheadline  167  168 topheadline  169  170 topheadline  171  172 topheadline  173  174 topheadline  175  176 topheadline  177  178 topheadline  179  180 topheadline  181  182 topheadline  183  184 topheadline  185  186 topheadline  187  188 topheadline  189  190 topheadline  191  192 topheadline",homeless
buffalo,Linking community benefits to a Bills stadium,2022-01-27T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WNY,"Erie County Legislature Chair April Baskin doesnt concern herself with whether a new Buffalo Bills stadium will be built in Buffalo or Orchard Park. Shes not particularly worried about its cost. What matters most, Baskin told Investigative Post, is what the community gets in exchange for the taxpayer dollars the teams owners want from the state and county. Pegula Sports and Entertainment has made it clear the team expects significant public subsidies  as much as 1 billion3  to build a new facility adjacent to the current stadium in Orchard Park. Baskin is determined that those subsidies come attached to a legally binding community benefits agreement, or CBA, modeled on agreements won by other communities across the country. A CBA is a transformational opportunity, Baskin said, to win funding for programs meant to improve the lives and prospects of the countys urban and rural poor. The success of a publicly funded stadium, she said, should be measured by how the project helps people who really need public dollars to be reinvested in their upward mobility. As an example of what Western New Yorkers might seek in a CBA with the Bills, Baskin pointed to agreements won in other cities4, including Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Nashville and Atlanta. Of particular interest to Baskin and her allies is the 2020 agreement between the Los Angeles Clippers and Inglewood, CA., where the NBA franchise is building a 1.8 billion arena. Inglewood sold the Clippers 13 acres of city-owned land for the project at a cost of 66 million. In exchange, the team agreed to commit 100 million to address some of the host communitys pressing needs. That money will seed a revolving loan fund for affordable housing projects. It will pay for educational programs and college scholarships, build a new library and community center, and provide assistance for renters facing eviction and aid to first-time homebuyers, among other initiatives. The deal also included benchmarks for local hiring and contracting, engaging minority- and women-owned businesses, and paying a living wage to workers during and after construction. Our series on community benefit agreements Wednesday How CBAs work in other cities. Read5. Today Lawmaker proposes a CBA for Bills stadium. Friday WNY has never had a CBA for a major project. These provisions are typical, according to John Goldstein, who has consulted with numerous community organizations across the country fighting for CBAs. He maintains a database of more than 350 such agreements, many of them centered on professional sports arenas. Whether its infrastructure, whether its discounted land, whether its a direct subsidy  especially with stadiums, there always are significant public investments, Goldstein told Investigative Post. That means that we, the public, are investors in the project. And so we are entitled to be part of the team negotiating the deal. A Bills CBA proposal Any deal for a new Bills stadium will require legislative approval  first from Erie County lawmakers, then the New York State Legislature. Before a proposal passes at the Erie County Legislature, Baskin told Investigative Post, she would like a CBA that includes baseline hiring and contracting commitments that outstrip those already required by the state for projects that use public money. During the construction period, those proposed commitments include 50 percent of the value of construction contracts to minority- and women-owned businesses. 30 percent of construction hours to workers defined as disadvantaged, based on household income. 15 percent of construction hours to participants in an apprentice program  half of them from disadvantaged households. Baskins proposal also includes post-construction commitments, including 30 percent of retailers, vendors and service companies at the stadium should be minority- or women-owned. And half of those should come from disadvantaged ZIP codes. Greater diversity among the sheriffs deputies and private contractors who provide security on game days. Currently, only two of the 146 sheriff deputies in the division that works the stadium are people of color, according to Baskin. Public transportation to within a quarter mile of the new stadium, to be provided by the NFTA, the team, or both. Currently, the nearest bus stop is 2 miles away. One of the new stadiums suites should be designated a community suite, exclusively for the use of low-income families. In addition, Baskin wants the team to commit 100 million to various social programs serving the entire county, particularly those focused on alleviating disparities in the social determinants of health, according to a draft resolution she intends to bring before her fellow legislators. Follow us on Facebook6, Twitter7 and YouTube8 Baskin has a broad definition of what makes for a healthy community, including access to healthcare and healthy food, freedom from crime and gun violence, and the abatement of environmental health hazards, such as lead paint in old housing and pollution from highways and factories. An investment from this particular project into those specific areas would be transformational for the people in this region, she said. Baskins proposal would also create a community oversight board empowered to monitor compliance with the CBAs provisions. Getting to a deal Baskin is not alone pursuing a CBA. She has been working with state Senator Sean Ryan  whose district includes Orchard Park, the Pegulas preferred site for a new facility  to attach a CBA to any agreement. We have to make sure the stadium is built with unionized labor, Ryan said in an interview with the local podcast The Square9 last month. We have to make sure theres good diversity in that workforce. And then we have to look at the stadium on game days. There are a lot of employees there. Those workers, too, should be local, diverse, and reasonably paid, Ryan said, whether they are unionized or not. Baskins and Ryans efforts have been supported by a number of community groups, including the Partnership for the Public Good10, the Coalition for Economic Justice11and PUSH Buffalo12. If were going to put public money into what is essentially a leisure activity that requires some discretionary income to enjoy, then we also need to make some commitments to help people who are struggling, Andrea Súilleabhin, executive director of the Partnership for the Public Good, told Investigative Post. Were really looking to our legislators to hold back that approval until they see more discussion of community benefits. Also supporting a CBA is Bills in Buffalo13, an ad hoc group pushing for the new stadium to be built in the city. Jim Heaney discusses Bills stadium on Capitol Pressroom We need to get every last bit that we can from this deal, and part of that is having a CBA, Benjamin Siegel, vice president of Signature Development and a founder of Bills in Buffalo, told Investigative Post. Specifically, Siegel is concerned with the contracts paid for with public dollars  concessions and security and construction jobs and everything else, he said. You dont just give it to your cronies. You give it to the people in the community that need it. Henry Taylor14, director of the Center for Urban Studies at the University at Buffalo15, is a Bills season ticket-holder. He, too, wants to be certain that the expenditure of public money on a stadium results in broad community benefits. My question is Who gets the billion? Taylor told Investigative Post. Who are the workers? Who are the owners of the companies? What are the communities they live in? Our Weekly Newsletter This iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.16 Follow Us said she has shared her proposal  called Invest Well Erie17  with members of the Democratic majority caucus in the county Legislature, local state legislators, and the local liaison for Gov. Kathy Hochul, as well as block clubs and community organizations. Im talking to whoever will listen to me, she said. I believe that what we need is a coalition of people that get behind this concept and demand it, so that those negotiators in the room have a clear understanding that this is not a request of the people, but it is an absolute must-have in order for the stadium to come to fruition. Goldstein, the consultant, said the keys to a successful CBA campaign are building a community-based coalition, understanding a project and its financing, mapping out the power structures and the politics, understanding the points at which decisions can be influenced, and then organizing like crazy to pressure the decision-makers. The best coalitions are the ones that are the best organizers, because they can change the power dynamic around a given project, Goldstein said. Siegel, the real estate developer advocating for a stadium in the city, said a good CBA will require fortitude from community groups and elected officials alike. I just hope people dont lose their backbone on this and at least get something out of it, and are adamant that we get this or we cant make a deal with you, Siegel said.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor. The gentleman from Virginia Mr. Scott and the gentlewoman from North Carolina Ms. Foxx each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia Mr. Scott. General Leave Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials on H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, our country codified the basic idea that all workers should earn equal pay for equal work, regardless of sex. Regrettably, more than five decades later and after the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, that promise remains unfulfilled. Today, women continue to be paid, on average, 82 cents on the dollar compared to men. This wage disparity is far worse for women of color, who make less than White men and White women. It exists across every sector, regardless of education, experience, occupation, industry or job title. A recent Census Bureau study found that 38 to 70 percent of the gender wage gap is unexplained and likely due to discrimination. Drawn out over a lifetime, the persistent wage gap could cost a woman anywhere from 400,000 to 2 million. This impacts both workers and their families, often meaning the difference between financial stability and perpetual hardship. The Paycheck Fairness Act offers an opportunity to finally secure equal pay for equal work. The bill strengthens the Equal Pay Act by bolstering workers rights to discuss their wages with coworkers and making it easier for workers to join class action lawsuits enhancing the enforcement tools available to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Labor Department and, more importantly, by Page H1802 closing loopholes for employer defenses and requiring employers to prove pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons. The Biden administration has issued a Statement of Administration Policy in support of this bill. It states Ensuring equal pay is essential to advancing American values of fairness and equity. Then it adds The Paycheck Fairness Act is commonsense legislation that would strengthen the Equal Pay Act and give workers more tools to fight sex-based pay discrimination. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration Policy of H.R 7. Statement of Administration Policy H.R 7--Paycheck Fairness Act--Rep. DeLauro, D-CT, and 225 cosponsors The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. Ensuring equal pay is essential to advancing American values of fairness and equity. Women lose thousands of dollars each year, and hundreds of thousands over a lifetime, because of the gender and racial wage gap. Women working full-time, year-round in 2019 earned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men working full-time year-round, and these disparities are greater for women of color. Pay inequity also impacts individuals who face intersecting forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, including LGBTQ individuals. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of women have dropped out of the labor force, partly reflecting the increased domestic labor demands on women. Caregiving demands often fall disproportionately on women, which leads to many women having to reduce their hours, resulting in lower earnings. As more and more American families rely on womens income, the pay gap hurts not only women, but also the families who depend on them. The cumulative impact of wage gaps adds up to financial insecurity over the course of a career for women and their families and for generations who follow. The Paycheck Fairness Act is commonsense legislation that would strengthen the Equal Pay Act and give workers more tools to fight sex-based pay discrimination. It would also take major steps toward increasing pay transparency, an essential provision to advance equality in the workplace, by explicitly protecting workers from retaliation for simply discussing their compensation with their colleagues. The bill would also expand opportunities for workers to receive training on effective negotiation skills. The bill would also limit an employers ability to rely on salary history during the hiring process to set pay, or when determining wages for a promotion. H.R 7 would hold employers accountable by closing judicially created loopholes for employer defenses and by adding a class action option under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The bill would require the collection of pay data to enable better enforcement of laws prohibiting pay discrimination. The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to address pay equity and urges quick action on this landmark bill. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R 7, the Democrats conveniently titled, but painfully misguided, Paycheck Fairness Act, which should be called the paychecks for trial lawyers act. We all agree on the fundamental principle of this bill women should not be paid less than men for the same work. That is not up for debate and, for me, it has never been up for debate and, for our country, it hasnt been since 1963, when the Equal Pay Act amended the Fair Labor Standards Act, making equal pay the law of the land. Moreover, in 1964, title VII of the Civil Rights Act codified nondiscrimination rules for employment, making it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, and sex. The question before us today is whether the Democrats Paycheck Fairness Act provides any additional protections to women in the workplace. The answer is a resounding no. The United States has some of the most varied and complex workplaces in the world. Before the onslaught of COVID-19, women were earning merited paychecks in record numbers. According to a Harvard University analysis and numerous other studies, the difference in earning between men and women comes down to choices made regarding careers and parenting. Many working women take advantage of flexible work schedules to meet their diverse needs. A survey by Pew found 70 percent of working mothers say that a flexible schedule is extremely important. Democrats arent giving the full story when they talk about pay differences. Women are making career choices that are best for themselves and their families. Limiting their freedom to do so is wrong. Congress has no place in telling women their career choices are wrong, yet Democrats are hellbent on telling all Americans how to live their lives, how to spend their money, and now how to make career decisions. The Paycheck Fairness Act is not a win for women in the slightest. It is a false promise that creates opportunities and advantages only for trial lawyers looking for easy payouts while causing irreparable harm to employers. By making it much easier to bring lawsuits of questionable validity against employers, trial lawyers will be able to force employers into settlements or try for unlimited paydays from jury awards, lining their own pockets and dragging women through tedious, never-ending legal proceedings. In the United States, we believe in innocence until proven guilty, but this bill assumes otherwise. Under current law, business owners can defend themselves from a claim of pay discrimination by proving that a pay differential is based on legitimate, business-related factors other than sex. H.R 7 would radically alter this law, requiring a business owner to convince a judge or jury that the pay differential was required by business necessity. This is a nearly impossible burden of proof to meet that will lead to unfair judgments against business owners because the plain meaning of the term business necessity is that the pay differential must be absolutely essential to the business. H.R 7 would also result in a flood of litigation in front of judges and juries, who will delve into employer compensation decisions even when the employer can demonstrate that those decisions are based on legitimate, business-related reasons having nothing to do with the sex of the employee. Fearing Big Government and liability risks that could leave them bankrupt, many business owners will likely implement rigid pay bands--a model used by government and unionized businesses. This means workers will not be compensated on the basis of merit. This is the opposite of the American Dream. As one columnist wrote equality of opportunity--not outcomes--is the American ideal. On top of the legal jeopardy this bill creates for employers, H.R 7 also mandates that business owners submit mountains of worker pay data to the Federal Government. This will pose significant threats to the confidentiality and privacy of workers pay data, create a data stash that would be impossible to protect or interpret, and cost business owners more than 600 million annually. This bill purports to champion equality for women, yet it disregards the 40 percent of small businesses owned by women that will be forced to implement pay policies found in government-run workplaces and be stuck paying through the nose in compliance costs if this bill passes. Even worse, H.R 7 will severely limit workplace flexibility for women. Many working women take advantage of flexible work schedules to meet their diverse needs, yet this harmful legislation completely ignores this reality and threatens to take away the choices and freedom necessary for them to retain employment. We know employees prefer workable and flexible schedules, and now is not the time to limit these options for women who have been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Should my Democrat colleagues wish to discuss additional policies which will foster the advancement of women in the workplace, we can consider legislation that safely reopens our schools and businesses, provides the flexibility and support to expand work-based learning programs and create viable pathways that enable more individuals to reskill and build fulfilling careers on their own terms, and promotes career and technical education, to name a few. Unfortunately, my Democrat colleagues would rather impose radical Page H1803 and unworkable policy under the guise of progress than find bipartisan solutions which foster environments where individuals are empowered to succeed and make the decisions that are best for them. Mr. Speaker, I urge a no vote on H.R 7, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts Ms. Clark, who is the Assistant Speaker of the House. Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, in December, American women lost 156,000 jobs, accounting for 100 percent of jobs lost and since the start of this pandemic, nearly 3 million women have been pushed out of the workforce. Women have borne the brunt of the economic crisis brought on by this pandemic, and gender pay inequality is at the root of the problem. More than five decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, women still only make 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, and that gap is even wider for women of color. By passing the Paycheck Fairness Act today, we are correcting this injustice and ensuring that all people receive equal pay for equal work. Lets be clear this isnt a womens issue. Pay inequity hurts children, families, and our entire economy. It is fundamental to our recovery and our ability to not just rebuild to status quo, but to rebuild a just and inclusive America for all. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia Mr. Good. Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Foxx for yielding. Mr. Speaker, everyone supports equal pay for equal performance, and everyone is against gender-based wage discrimination. This has been the law for nearly 60 years. When I entered the workforce 30 years ago after college, wage discrimination was basically nonexistent, thanks to the law and a simple recognition of the value of a diverse workforce. Companies then, as now, simply assigned a starting salary based upon the position, and paid that wage to everyone they hired thereafter providing merit increases based upon performance, unlike what happens in union shops and with government positions. But do my Democrat friends across the aisle base their staff salaries on gender? Or do they pay women less than men? Or do they set salaries based on market conditions, qualifications, and experience? time 1245 Why do they assume less of private employers? We already have laws and protections that ensure fair pay, and companies must maintain documentation demonstrating nondiscrimination in wages, performance evaluations, and merit increases. In fact, we are in a much stronger position today than we were 30, let alone 60 years ago. This legislation from the Democrat Party is just another attempt to insert themselves further into the workplace with a purported cure for a disease that doesnt exist. Democrats are dependent upon the perception of discrimination and victimhood to expand their base of power as they continue to divide us as a Nation. Democrats also view employers, businesses, and job creators with disdain, believing that, left to their own devices, they would seek to harm and exploit their employees. Not to worry, Big Government to the rescue or, more accurately, big Democrat government laying on more control, more regulations, more mandates, all designed to enrich their trial lawyer friends and increase liability for employers. The Democrats will disingenuously cite statistics that indicate that there are discrepancies in income based on gender, but they wont specify discrepancies in pay for the same positions in the same industries because they dont exist. This bill adds more layers of burdensome and costly reporting requirements for businesses, estimated to cost about 600 million a year, costs which will be passed on to consumers in higher prices with no real benefit. The bill doesnt do anything to help women in the workplace, but it hurts employers, exposing them to greater liability, and enriches the trial lawyer donors to the Democrat Party. It allows the lawyers to litigate every decision an employer makes, and to bankrupt small businesses by seeking unlimited monetary damages. It makes it impossible for employers to defend charges of gender- based discrimination when experience, qualifications, or performance warrants higher pay. They would now need to prove that the determination is a business necessity. Leave it to politicians in Washington to think that they have the right to determine for employers what is a business necessity. Left to themselves, businesses and employers tend to get it right. But Big Government almost never gets it right, and this bill is no exception. I urge a no vote. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut Ms. DeLauro, the sponsor of the bill, a champion for equal pay, and the chair of the House Appropriations Committee. Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Paycheck Fairness Act, legislation that I have introduced in every Congress since 1997. Since then, we have pushed and battled to strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963. We launched, side by side, into the fray to elevate pay discrimination, to emphasize how central its impact is to working families. I cannot tell you how difficult it has been to break through on something so simple so simple. Men and women in the same job deserve the same pay. It is a principle that we adhere to in this Congress, and I dont believe anyone would challenge it. The same is true of the U.S military. Last month, we recognized Equal Pay Day on March 24, which is the day into the current year that women must work to meet the wages earned by men in the previous year. The National Committee on Pay Equity tells us, at its lowest point in 1973, full-time, working women earned a median of 56.6 cents to every dollar that full-time working men earned. Today, women who work full- time, year-round are paid, on average, only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. The gap exists in every State, regardless of geography, occupation, education, or work patterns. And it is worse for women of color. Latinas are typically paid 55 cents Native American women 60 cents Black women 63 cents Asian American and Pacific Islander women are paid as little as 52 cents. This wage disparity costs the average American woman and her family an estimated 400,000 to 2 million, impacting Social Security benefits and pensions. Today, the issue and the environment have collided. This pandemic has brought out the depth of our problem, exposed existing inequalities, and threatened womens economic security at a disproportionate rate. Women have lost more than five million jobs and as we seek to rebuild our economy, let us remember that the pay gap hurts not only women, but also the families who depend on them. The Paycheck Fairness Act is a bipartisan piece of legislation, which has the support of every member of the Democratic Caucus, as well as three Republicans. It would toughen the remedies in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to give Americas working women the opportunity to fight wage discrimination and receive the paycheck they have rightfully earned. It would require employers to prove that pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons ban retaliation against workers who discuss their wages it facilitates a wronged workers participation in a class action suit and it prohibits employers from seeking the salary history of prospective employees. And by now, we are all familiar with the case of Lilly Ledbetter. Her bosses said Their plant did not need women that women did not help, and, in fact, they caused problems. Well, a jury found that, yes, Lilly Ledbetter had been discriminated against, and awarded her 3.8 million in back pay and damages, which the Supreme Court eliminated. She received nothing, as it closed the courtroom door to all women. We, the Congress, reopened that door with the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It reversed the Supreme Courts decision. It was a court access case, but it Page H1804 did not address the underlying issue of pay discrimination. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, in his State of the Union address, said Legislation to apply the principle of equal pay for equal work without discrimination because of sex is a matter of simple justice. I earnestly urge the Congress to move swiftly to implement these needed labor measures. When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law nearly 58 years ago, he said It is a first step. It affirms our determination that when women enter the labor force, they will find equality in their pay envelopes. The Paycheck Fairness Act is the next step. It simply brings the Equal Pay Act into line with the remedies already available for those who are subject to other forms of employment discrimination. That is it, pure and simple. We have passed paycheck fairness through this House in 2008, 2009, 2019. But, now, in the 117th Congress in which we welcomed the most women in our history, we must get it into law. We have the opportunity to make good on that promise that Presidents of both parties have made. We need to seize that moment. It is time for us to say that the work that women do in our society today is valued and respected, and the contribution that we make, if it is good enough for the women in the House of Representatives, then it is good enough for women all over the United States. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act by a broad coalition of organizations that promote economic opportunity for women. February 3, 2021. Co-Sponsor and Support Swift Passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act Dear Member of Congress As members of a broad coalition of organizations that promote economic opportunity for women and vigorous enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, we strongly urge you to co-sponsor and push for swift passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act as a top priority of the 117th Congress. Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender pay gaps persist, and earnings lost to these gaps are exacerbating the financial effects of COVID-19, falling particularly heavily on women of color and the families who depend on their income. This legislation offers a much needed update to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to battle pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination. The COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism have exposed how the work performed primarily by women, and particularly Black and brown women, has long been and continues to be undervalued and underpaid, even as the rest of the country is newly recognizing the essential nature of this work. Black women, Latinas, and other women of color are especially likely to be on the front lines of the crisis, risking their lives in jobs in health care, child care, and grocery stores they are also being paid less than their male counterparts. At the same time, women in this country lost more than 5 million jobs in 2020 indeed, women accounted for 100 of the jobs lost in December 2020. The unemployment rate for Black women and Latinas remains exceptionally high. These high jobless numbers threaten to exacerbate gender wage gaps when women regain employment. We cannot build back an economy that works for everyone without ensuring that all women can work with equality, safety, and dignity, starting with pay equity. There is no more fitting way to begin this session than by making real, concrete progress in ensuring all women receive fair pay. The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and strengthens the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it provides robust protection against sex-based pay discrimination. Among other provisions, this comprehensive bill bars retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages. It closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work without any important business justification related to the job. It ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity. It prohibits employers from relying on salary history in determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not follow women from job to job. And it also provides much needed training and technical assistance, as well as data collection and research. Women are increasingly the primary or co-breadwinner in their families and cannot afford to be shortchanged any longer. Women working full-time, year-round are typically paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. But for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts, Black women only make 63 cents, Native women only 60 cents, and Latinas only 55 cents. While Asian American and Pacific Islander AAPI women make 87 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, women in many AAPI communities experience drastically wider pay gaps. Furthermore, moms are paid less than dads. And even when controlling for factors, such as education and experience, the pay gaps persist and start early in womens careers and contribute to a wealth gap that follows them throughout their lifetimes. These pay gaps can be addressed only if workers have the legal tools necessary to challenge discrimination and employers are provided with effective incentives and technical assistance to comply with the law. We recently commemorated the twelfth anniversary of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. That vital law rectified the Supreme Courts harmful decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire amp Rubber Company. The law helps to ensure that individuals subjected to unlawful compensation discrimination are able to have their day in court and effectively assert their rights under federal antidiscrimination laws. But the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, critical as it is, is only one step on the path to ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work. Its time to take the next step toward achieving equal pay. We urge you to prioritize the Paycheck Fairness Act in the 117th Congress by co-sponsoring and urging swift passage of this legislation, taking up the cause of Lilly Ledbetter and all those who have fought for equal pay. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Kate Nielson, Director of Public Policy amp Legal Advocacy at the American Association of University Women or Emily Martin, Vice President for Education amp Workplace Justice at the National Womens Law Center.

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan Mrs. McClain. Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. We dont need the government telling business how much they can pay their employees. Lets not forget that it is business that has lifted us out of poverty, not the government. As a former businesswoman who has actually signed the front of paychecks, not just the backs, what you do as an employee and what you produce as an employee matters, and what you produce should be reflected in your outcome, not your gender. Do not--please, do not insult me as a woman by lowering the bar for me. And please, do not insult me as a business owner for forcing me to lower the bar for my employees. Outcomes and hard work are what leads to success, not your gender. Gender discrimination is already against the law thanks to the Equal Pay Act. At a time when businesses are shutting their doors due to the pandemic, we should be creating jobs and incentivizing people to work. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from North Carolina Ms. Adams, chair of the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. Ms. ADAMS. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and for his support, and for his leadership on the committee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as I have done for my entire career, from the North Carolina House to the U.S House, in support of equal pay for equal work. It is 2021, and women are still subject to unequal, unfair compensation in the workplace. This truth, this wage gap is at its worst for women of color. Black women, for example, earn an average of 63 cents on the dollar compared to men. This issue persists in nearly every line of work, regardless of education, experience, occupation, industry, or job title. And if you dont believe that data, take it from me. I have lived it. The Paycheck Fairness Act is an opportunity for Congress to strengthen the Equal Pay Act, to bolster the rights of working women, and to put an end to the gender-based wage disparity once and for all. We cannot continue to rob nearly half of our Nations workforce of the wages they deserve, nor can we continue to force women to work far more just to be paid fairly. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National Partnership for Women and Families in support of H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. National Partnership for Women amp Families, April 13, 2021. Dear Member of Congress The National Partnership for Women amp Families is a non-profit, non-partisan advocacy organization committed to improving the lives of women and families by achieving equity for all women. Since our creation as the Womens Legal Defense Fund in 1971, we have fought for every significant federal advance for equal opportunity in the workplace, including the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. We write in strong support of H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, and urge you to vote for passage while opposing any harmful amendments. This critical bill will help our nation build back an economy that works for everyone by ensuring that all women can work with equality and dignity. As the Paycheck Fairness Act recognizes, women and workers from communities of color continue to face significant pay disparities in the United States. On average, women working full time and year-round are paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, and the wage gap is widest for women of color. Among women who hold full-time, year-round jobs in the United States, Black women are typically paid 63 cents, Native American women 60 cents and Latinas just 55 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. White, non- Hispanic women are paid 79 cents. Asian American and Pacific Islander AAPI women who work full time, year-round are paid as little as 52 cents for every dollar paid to white, non- Hispanic men, as Burmese women are. Asian American women overall are paid just 87 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. The wage gap persists across different industries, occupations and education levels and exists in nearly every congressional district. These troubling statistics underscore the need to update our nations equal pay laws. The Paycheck Fairness Act would make it safe for workers to discuss their wages with each other. Employers can currently mask compensation discrimination with pay secrecy policies that forbid employees from discussing pay and benefits. Secrecy and the threat of retaliation leave workers unable to learn about and challenge pay disparities. In a survey of private-sector workers, over 62 percent of women and 60 percent of men reported that their employers discourage or prohibit discussing wage and salary information. The Paycheck Fairness Act would make pay secrecy policies illegal. The Paycheck Fairness Act would also prohibit employers from screening job applicants based on their salary history or requiring salary history during the interview process. Women are typically paid lower wages than men even in their first jobs. Salary disparities that begin early in a womans career can follow her from job to job when employers are permitted to base a new hires salary on her prior earnings. People should be paid fairly for the job they are being hired to do. The bill would also make it more difficult for employers to justify pay discrimination. Workers in the same company who do the same job and have the same amount of experience, education and training should be paid the same. Currently, however, employers are able to explain away differences in pay too easily by relying on a catch-all defense in the Equal Pay Act. The Paycheck Fairness Act would close that loophole and require employers to prove that any differences in pay are not sex-based, are job-related concerning the position in question, and are consistent with business necessity and account for the entire difference in compensation. Employees claiming pay discrimination would also have new opportunities to prove that the employers defense is the pretext. In addition to these critical provisions, the Paycheck Fairness Act would also allow workers alleging pay discrimination within the same company to file class-action suits would change the remedies of the Equal Pay Act to treat gender-based pay discrimination claims the same as other civil rights violations that result in unfair pay would recognize companies that want to do better and would improve fair pay enforcement, data collection and disclosure. Closing the gender and racial wage gap is a crucial measure to take in response to COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, women and people of color have disproportionately experienced the adverse effects of the public health and economic crisis. Women and people of color have been on the front lines working in our most essential occupations, but forces like wage inequality have kept them underpaid and undervalued. The Paycheck Fairness Act would ensure that workers are given the support needed to ensure pay equity during this time of crisis. Updating our nations equal pay laws is also crucial to reducing negative impacts resulting from the mass exodus of women from the labor force during the pandemic. Womens labor force participation is at a 33-year record low, with nearly a million moms having left the workforce, largely due to the difficulties of balancing full-time work and care responsibilities. Increases in womens labor force participation rates drove the significant narrowing of the gender wage gap during the 1970s and 1980s, a narrowing which stagnated in the late 1990s, around the time womens labor force participation peaked. Without the Paycheck Fairness Act, progress on closing the gender wage gap could be set back decades, especially since women face financial penalties for taking time out of the workforce, with one study finding that women who took just one year out of the workforce had annual earnings 39 percent lower than women who did not. Page H1806 The Paycheck Fairness Act would strengthen existing federal protections, ensure more equitable workplaces and allow women to remain in the workforce and maintain their economic stability at all phases of life. At the current rate of progress, projections are that the gender wage gap will close in 2041 for Asian women, 2069 for white women, 2369 for Black women, and 2451 for Latina women. Women cannot--and should not--wait that long for pay equity. It is time to clarify and strengthen existing federal protections for women in the workforce by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. We urge you to vote in support and opposed harmful amendments. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R 7. This bill is a solution in search of a problem, and it does nothing to help employees. In reality, the bill would only boost paychecks for trial lawyers and not workers. H.R 7 places unworkable, burdensome restrictions on employers, and also poses a threat to worker privacy. Even more, this bill would kill the Christmas bonus by effectively prohibiting employers from paying end-of-the-year bonuses to their employees. This hardly seems fair to an employee, despite the title of the bill. Republicans tried to strengthen the bill during the committee markup. My colleague, Ms. Stefanik, offered an amendment that would have made commonsense improvements to the text, but that amendment was rejected by the Democrats. I urge a no vote on the bill. We should not allow trial lawyers and burdensome restrictions to kill the Christmas bonus under the false guise of fairness. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, this bill will prohibit paying all the men a bonus and none of the women a bonus, although they have produced equally for the business. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Georgia Mrs. McBath, a distinguished member of the Committee on Education and Labor. Mrs. McBATH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act. I want to commend Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro for her extraordinary efforts and commend Chairman Scott for bringing this timely policy to fruition. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act. I think most of us can agree that every American should earn equal pay for equal work. This legislation takes meaningful steps toward ensuring that every American, regardless of gender, receives fair compensation for their work. We have seen over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic that essential workers are the lifeblood of our society. We have seen women on the frontlines in the hospital, in the classroom, and at our essential retail stores, and it is time that all of these sheroes are compensated at the same rate as their male counterparts. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters urging passage of this legislation and highlighting the persistent wage gaps between genders. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Washington, DC, April 13, 2021. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative On behalf of the more than 1.4 million members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I urge you to support fundamental fairness by combating wage discrimination on the basis of sex by passing H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. I urge you to vote yes on H.R 7 and to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without any weakening amendments. The Paycheck Fairness Act would address the persistent wage gap based on sex by eliminating loopholes that hinder the effectiveness of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. H.R 7 would update and strengthen the Equal Pay Act in important ways. The bill closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work without any important business purpose related to the job. It would require employers to demonstrate that wage gaps are truly the result of factors other than gender. Importantly, it would prohibit retaliation against workers who share salary information or inquire about their employers wage practices. H.R 7 would also bring the remedies and procedures of the Equal Pay Act into conformance with those available for other civil rights claims. The Paycheck Fairness Act holds employers accountable for pay discrepancies between their male and female employees while strengthening incentives to prevent pay discrimination. And, it would preclude pay discrimination from following women from job to job. While some progress has been made since the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, the wage gap still persists, and disparities are evident at every educational level. Nationally, women still earn only 82 cents for every dollar earned by their male colleagues. For women of color, the wage gaps are even larger. Passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act will provide women and all other workers the tools necessary to challenge discrimination against them. It is an important step in making real progress in the fight to eliminate the gender wage gap and to provide economic, and retirement, security to women and their families. It is well past the time to end pay discrimination in the workplace. The Teamsters Union urges you to reject weakening amendments and to vote yes on final passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. Sincerely, James P. Hoffa, General President. Mrs. McBATH. Mr. Speaker, the gender gap is clear, and the Paycheck Fairness Act will address this disparity. Not only will this legislation help women in Georgia, but it will help families across the Nation. time 1300 Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, proponents of H.R 7 claim that despite current prohibitions against pay discrimination, female workers are still paid, on average, considerably less than male workers and, as a result, a pernicious wage gap exists. However, many studies demonstrate that the gap is not necessarily the product of workplace discrimination. In fact, this gap nearly disappears when factors such as hours worked per week, rate of leaving the workforce, and industry and occupation are considered. A 2020 study by compensation software company PayScale found that when controlling for job title, years of experience, industry, location, and other compensable factors, women earned 98 percent as much as men. A 2009 study commissioned by the U.S Department of Labor found a gender wage gap of between 4.8 and 7.1 percent when controlling for economic variables between men and women. A 2018 Harvard study found that the gap in pay between female and male bus and train operators working for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, MBTA, can be explained by the workplace choices that women and men make rather than other factors, such as discrimination. The study found that the earnings gap for MBTA bus and train operators is explained by the fact that the male operators took 48 percent fewer unpaid hours off and worked 83 percent more overtime hours per year than the female operators. I want to point out that I am giving you facts here, Mr. Speaker, facts. These differences are not due to any different work options faced by female and male operators. Rather, the study found that the female operators had a greater demand for workplace flexibility and a lower demand for overtime work hours than the male operators. Pay discrimination is wrong and already illegal. We probably cannot say that enough. Any new legislation to combat pay discrimination should be based on facts, not supposition, not projection. The facts seem to be sorely missing from this debate. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York Mr. Espaillat, a distinguished member of the Committee on Education and Labor. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I include in the Record a letter from the Equal Rights Advocates in support of H.R 7. Equal Rights Advocates, April 14, 2021. Re Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7 and vote no on harmful amendments. Dear Representative As the House votes on the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7, Equal Rights Advocates strongly urges you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R 7, without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. Equal Rights Advocates ERA is a national, non-profit legal organization based in San Francisco, California, whose mission is to protect and expand economic and educational access and opportunities for women and girls. We have a long history of working Page H1807 to address pay discrimination and to close the gender wage gap. We have litigated numerous cases relating to pay discrimination and regularly provide information and resources to employees who contact our free legal information hotline regarding unlawful gender and race-based pay disparities. We also advocate for various bills at the state-level to ensure economic and gender justice for women and families. Most recently, ERA has co-sponsored SB 973 Jackson, 2020 which requires California employers with 100 employees or more to submit an annual pay data report to the Department of Industrial Relations outlining the compensation and hours worked of its employees by gender, race, ethnicity, and job category. This allows state agencies to more efficiently identify patterns of wage disparities and encourages employers to analyze their own pay practices to ensure they are fair and lawful. Additionally, ERA co-sponsored the California Fair Pay Act, SB 358, Jackson, 2016 which amended and strengthened our states Equal Pay Act to prohibit employer secrecy rules, clarify that workers must be paid equally to coworkers of another sex who perform substantially similar work, unless the employer proves that the disparity was due to a legitimate, job-related, bona fide factor not based on or derived from sex. We also cosponsored AB 168 Eggman, 2017 which prohibits California employers from inquiring about prior salary and requires them to provide the pay Scale for a position in question upon reasonable request and AB 2282 Eggman, 2018 which clarified that prior salary cannot be used on its own, or in combination with a lawful factor, to justify a wage differential under the California Equal Pay Act. Finally, ERA also chairs Equal Pay Today, a national collaboration of organizations working at the local, regional, and federal level to close the gender wage gap. Today in the United States, despite the passage of previous equal pay legislation, including the critically important Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the gender pay gap remains pervasive. Women, even those who work full-time and year round, still only earn 80 cents to a mans dollar. This gives rise to a nationwide pay gap of 900 billion every year. For women of color, the pay gap is even larger. For every dollar earned by a non-Hispanic white man, Latina women earn only 53 cents, Native American women only 58 cents, and Black women only 61 cents. These large pay gaps, although of varying sizes across demographics of women, prove harmful to the economic security of women and families across the country. The negative economic consequences of these gender pay gaps are especially pronounced as mothers are primary or sole breadwinners in half of U.S households with children. Of these female-headed households, one-quarter of them fall below the poverty line. As it stands, the gender and race pay gaps are closing at a glacial pace. At current rates, the gender wage gap will not close until 2059. For women of color, the picture is even bleaker. It will not be until 2124 that Black women receive equal pay to white men and not until 2233 that Latinas receive the same. Now is the time for action. The Paycheck Fairness Act is an important step in accelerating the closing of the gender pay gap. Among many provisions, the Paycheck Fairness Act would bar retaliation for discussing or disclosing wages. According to the Institute for Womens Policy Research, across the country, about half of workers were prohibited or strongly discouraged from disclosing their wages to other employees. Yet, when an individual is unable to discuss wages with other employees, it becomes exceedingly difficult to determine if one is making less than ones colleagues. By ending the practice of pay secrecy, the Paycheck Fairness Act would make it harder for employers to keep pervasive practices of pay discrimination hidden. In addition, the Paycheck Fairness Act would also prohibit employers from relying on salary history when setting the wages of their employees. This provision is critical as the practice of relying on prior salary can lead to a single act of pay discrimination following a woman throughout her career. One year out of college, women are already earning 7 percent less than their male colleagues, even after controlling for factors such as college major, occupation, or hours worked. If a womans prior salary is used by future employers, the gender pay gap will continue to persist as a depressed past salary continues to be used to determine future wages. Prohibiting employer reliance on salary history will help stop the perpetuation of unequal pay. Another crucial provision in this version of the Paycheck Fairness Act is the commitment to pay data collection. As mentioned above, ERA fought for pay data collection at the California state-level and secured this via SB 973 Jackson, 2020. The need to ensure equal pay is now more apparent than ever during the current COVID-19 health and economic crisis, which has exposed the lasting harm of unequal pay and other contributors to economic security on women, and in particular, women of color. Pay data collection helps uncover pay discrimination, which is a major contributor to the overall gender and race-based wage gaps. Recognizing that pay discrimination is difficult to detect and address, the Obama Administration announced a proposed revision to the Employer Information Report EEO-1 to include the reporting of pay data by gender, race and ethnicity beginning in 2018. For more than 50 years, large companies have been submitting these EEO-1 reports with demographic information to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC. This data has helped the agency to identify patterns of occupational segregation and discrimination and enforce federal equal pay and anti- discrimination law. However, the Trump Administration put a halt to the implementation of this new rule, dealing a significant blow to the fight for equal pay. The Paycheck Fairness Act would also close loopholes that allow employers to pay women less without a legitimate business justification and would provide the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination as race and ethnicity based discrimination. It would also require wage data collection and support salary negotiation skills training programs to give women the tools to advocate for higher wages. Salary negotiation workshops have been shown to be highly effective. For example, in a study conducted following the free salary negotiation workshops put on by the city of Boston, the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts Boston found that nearly half of the women who were interviewed had either successfully negotiated a pay raise or starting salary that brought them either to or above the market rate following the training. As the bill states, these continuing pay disparities have devastating impacts on women, especially women of color. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have found this to be even more true. Since last February, 2.4 million women have exited the workforce, or, been pushed out of the workforce, highlighting a dramatic regress for gender equity. More and more women are forced to stay home in order to care for children and loved ones while men continue to work. Before the pandemic, women did, on average, three times more unpaid care work than men, and this responsibility has heightened since the pandemic given school and childcare closures, and increased care needs for elderly relatives. Women who are able to remain in the workforce, however, are still paid less than their male colleagues, especially Black women and women of color. COVID-19 has exacerbated these long-standing gender and racial inequities. Now, more than ever, elected officials must recognize these disparate impacts and deliver solutions to American women. Without continued efforts to provide women with the tools to challenge and unearth pay discrimination and provisions to keep employers from perpetuating persistent inequalities, the gender pay gap will not close. The Paycheck Fairness Act is an important step on the path towards a future where women can stand on equal economic footing to their male counterparts. For these reasons, we are proud to support the Paycheck Fairness Act and urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. Jessica Stender, Senior Counsel, Workplace Justice amp Public Policy. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, it should offend every one of us that there remains a pay gap between men and women for the same work. Women of color, in particular--African-American women, Latina women, Native American women, AAPI women--are making as low as 52 cents, Mr. Speaker, for every dollar for the same job and work by a man. This is a travesty. Lets make our communities stronger. Lets make our economy stronger. In Harlem, East Harlem, northern Manhattan, and the northwest Bronx, women of color are the majority of workers. I cant go back home to my district and say that somehow they are working the same as men, or maybe more, in many cases, and are making less. I support H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, because we need to bring fairness into the discussion. Lets make our communities stronger. Lets make our economy stronger. Gender-based pay discrimination should not be something we are still discussing now in 2021. The Paycheck Fairness Act will put everyone on the line to make sure that we are all doing our best to ensure fair and equitable pay. Closing the pay gap will make women and families financially stronger. Mr. Speaker, lets make our communities stronger. Lets make our economy stronger. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California Ms. Speier, the co-chair of the Democratic Caucus. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter titled Support the Paycheck Fairness Act written by The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, April 14, 2021. Support the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R 7--Vote No on Harmful Amendments Dear Representative On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Page H1808 Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 220 organizations to promote and protect the rights of all persons in the United States, we urge you to vote for the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R 7, without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. The Paycheck Fairness Act is a priority of The Leadership Conference, and we will include your vote on final passage in our Voting Record for the 117th Congress. Gender-based pay discrimination compromises the economic security of millions of women in the United States--and for women of color, the harm is exacerbated by their experience of both race- and gender-based wage disparities. Women working full-time, year-round in the United States are typically paid about 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, adding up to a loss of more than 400,000 over a lifetime. Black women are typically paid only 63 cents for every dollar paid to non-Hispanic white men, while Native American women are paid only 60 cents, Latinas are paid just 55 cents, and women in certain Asian American and Pacific Islander communities are paid as little as 52 cents. Research shows that the gender pay gap occurs across almost all occupations and industries, develops very early in womens careers, and grows over time. Action to close the wage gap is long overdue, but in light of the current economic crisis, it is even more critical that Congress act now to strengthen protections against pay discrimination, both as a matter of economic security and fundamental fairness. The loss of income and savings from the wage gap has exacerbated the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic for women of color and their families. Black and Brown women have been overrepresented in frontline jobs during the pandemic--many in low-paid jobs at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 and without benefits like paid leave and employer-sponsored health insurance--but they are paid less than non-Hispanic white men in the same jobs. Already struggling to make ends meet, women of color in low-pay jobs must also endure pay discrimination that artificially reduces their overall earnings, making it even less likely for women of color to amass the financial resources to withstand a health emergency and putting entire families at risk of economic insecurity. Almost 75 percent of Black mothers and more than 45 percent of Latina mothers were breadwinners in their families in 2018. At the same time, Black and Brown women have faced staggering job losses during the pandemic. The unemployment rate for Black women reached 17.4 percent in May 2020, for example, and Latinas experienced the highest unemployment rate of any group during the pandemic, at more than 20 percent in April of last year. The unemployment rate for Black women and Latinas remains exceptionally high. The Paycheck Fairness Act would update and strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to provide more effective protection against sex-based pay discrimination. The Paycheck Fairness Act would Prohibit retaliation against workers who discuss or disclose wages Prevent employers from relying on salary history to determine future pay so that pay discrimination does not extend from job to job Close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work without any business necessity related to the job Ensure that women can obtain the same remedies for sex- based pay discrimination as those available to people subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity Provide for much-needed training and technical assistance and require wage data collection. Women and their families can no longer be shortchanged. Given the importance of this bill, we urge representatives to pass H.R 7 without amendments that limit the bills scope or undermine its protections. Sincerely, Wade Henderson, Interim President and CEO. LaShawn Warren, Executive Vice President for Government Affairs. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, for a quarter of a century, Chairwoman DeLauro has been trying to get this bill passed. She is sick and tired, I am sick and tired, and American women are sick and tired of being treated like second-class citizens. Imagine if the women here in Congress were being paid 60, 70, or 80 percent of what our male colleagues are making. Do you think we would put up with it? Of course not. Somehow, American women are expected to put up with that. Do you want facts? Ask about Ms. Rexroat, from the State of Arizona, who was paid less than her colleague because they decided that they would base her salary on what she was making before, as opposed to the job at hand. We have a problem, Mr. Speaker. This has been going on for way too long. It is time for us to fix it for all the women and children in this country who want to be paid equally for equal work so that they have money for childcare, rent, food, and education. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia Ms. Norton, the previous head of the EEOC. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the American Bar Association supporting passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. American Bar Association, April 13, 2021. Re ABA Urges Passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. Dear Representative On behalf of the American Bar Association ABA, the largest voluntary association of lawyers and legal professionals in the world. I am writing to urge you to vote for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would update the Equal Pay Act of 1963 enacted by Congress almost 60 years ago to prohibit gender-based pay inequality. This legislation, which is expected to come to the floor this week, has the support of working men and women across the country who want this nation to live up to its expressed commitment to equal pay for equal work. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits an employer from paying unequal wages to male and female workers who perform jobs under similar work conditions that require substantially equal skill, effort, and responsibility unless there is a legitimate reason for a pay differential. The Paycheck Fairness Act does not alter the basic scheme of this statute or impose unreasonable burdens on employers indeed, the majority of its proposed changes are borrowed from other civil rights statutes that have proved more effective in eradicating workplace discrimination. We would like to respond to some persistent misperceptions regarding this important legislation Enactment of this bill will not compel businesses to pay their female workforce substantially more money to eliminate the existing wage gap. The purpose of this bill is to update the Equal Pay Act, which only applies in situations where women or men are receiving unequal pay for equal work. It does not create a new mandate. Employers already have a legal obligation to pay men and women equal wages for equal work unless there is a legitimate reason for the differential. Enactment of this bill will not interject the government into the pay decisions of businesses. The Paycheck Fairness Act does not tell employers what factors to use to set pay it only requires that pay decisions are job- and business- related. Enactment of this bill will not make employers liable for any and every wage differential. An employer will still have four affirmative defenses and will not be guilty of wage discrimination if a pay differential is based on i seniority, ii merit, iii a system that measures quantity or quality of production, or iv a factor other than sex. 29 U.S.C 206dl. The only difference is that Paycheck Fairness Act will resolve uncertainty in the law over how to apply the fourth defense by redefining it as a bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training, or experience. Enactment of a provision to clarify the factor other than sex defense will not eviscerate legitimate use of the defense. It is intended to prevent employers from asserting that unequal pay was the result of market force-derived excuses such as prior salaries or negotiation outcomes. A bona fide factor other than sex must be job-related, consistent with business necessity, and account for the entire differential in compensation at issue. The only time this defense would not apply would be in situations where an alternative employment practice is available that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential and the employer has refused to adopt it. Enactment of this bill will not encourage more lawsuits and jeopardize post-pandemic economic recovery. The bill is designed resolve uncertainties in the law and increase employer compliance with the Equal Pay Act, not to encourage more lawsuits. The bills strengthened remedies, which align with those available in other employment discrimination statutes, will encourage employers to review their wage-setting practices and rectify those that are based on invalid justifications. Men and women who are paid fairly have no incentive to jeopardize their jobs and subject themselves to costly, time- consuming, and emotionally taxing lawsuits brought against their employers. The bills clarification of the factor other than sex defense will not spawn new litigation. Instead, it will provide guidance to the courts and resolve uncertainty in the law. The standard, which is adapted from Title VII discrimination cases and codified in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, is one with which courts already are familiar. The bill will help strengthen the economy by improving the present and future economic welfare of working women, who comprise about one-half of the workforce and are the primary breadwinner in more than 12 million American families. We urge you to demonstrate your commitment to equal pay for equal work by voting for the Paycheck Fairness Act. Thank you for your consideration of our views. Sincerely, Patricia Lee Refo. Page H1809 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to strongly support H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, a critically important bill. As the first woman to chair the U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, I enforced the Equal Pay Act. I particularly appreciate that H.R 7 would bring long-awaited strength to the EPA. I especially appreciate that Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, a great champion for equal pay, has included my Pay Equity for All Act in H.R 7, where I will focus today. The Pay Equity for All Act would prohibit employers from asking job applicants their salary history. Even though many employers may not intentionally discriminate against applicants or employees based on gender, race, or ethnicity, setting wages based on salary history is routinely done in the workplace and can reinforce the wage gap. Evidence clearly shows that members of historically disadvantaged groups often start their careers with unfair and artificially low wages compared to their White male counterparts, and these disparities are compounded from job to job. Job and salary offers should be based on an applicants skill and merit, not on salary history. This bill addresses this problem by assessing penalties against employers who ask applicants for their salary history during the interview process. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R 7 requires that the employer defense must be consistent with business necessity, a broad and ill-defined term. We dont know how the courts will interpret this sweeping requirement, but we do know the dictionary says it means absolutely essential or indispensable. How can an employer prove that any one factor determining employee pay could rise to the level to be necessary for the survival of the business? Proponents of H.R 7 will argue this phrase has been adopted from title VII, as amended by the 1991 Civil Rights Act, but the phrase has spawned endless litigation because of its lack of clarity. Anyone who thinks this concept is simple and can just be carried over from title VII is either naive or has been misled. Further, the dubious concept of business necessity was developed under controversial so-called disparate impact analysis and cannot simply be slapped onto the Equal Pay Act, especially where, as mandated by H.R 7, damages are unlimited. In contrast, under title VII, in disparate impact cases, damages are limited to backpay and benefits. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas Mr. Green. Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this bill is really about mothers and daughters who earn about 82 cents on the dollar for every dollar a man earns. It is about mothers and daughters who lose about 1 trillion a year because of the wage gap. For those men who dont have a really good reason to vote for it, it is about the fact that a woman gave birth to every man alive. So for all of the suffering, we ought to vote for this bill, because we are here as a result of some woman suffering for us. At this time, I include in the Record a letter from the National Committee on Pay Equity. National Committee on Pay Equity, April 14, 2021. Re Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7 and vote no on harmful amendments. Dear Representative As the House votes on the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7, the National Committee on Pay Equity NCPE strongly urges you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R 7, without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. The National Committee on Pay Equity NCPE, founded in 1979, is a coalition of womens and civil rights organizations labor unions religious, professional, and educational associations, commissions on women, state and local pay equity coalitions and individuals working to eliminate sex- and race-based wage discrimination and to achieve pay equity. These pay gaps can be addressed only if workers have the legal tools necessary to challenge discrimination and employers are provided with effective incentives and technical assistance to comply with the law. The Paycheck Fairness Act is one of these urgently required tools. Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender pay gaps persist, and earnings lost to these gaps are exacerbating the financial effects of COVID-19, falling particularly heavily on women of color and the families who depend on their income. The Paycheck Fairness Act, which has been passed three previous times by the House of Representatives, mostly recently in the 116th Congress, offers a much-needed update to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to battle pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination. Women are increasingly the primary or co-breadwinner in their families and cannot afford to be shortchanged any longer. Women working full-time, year-round are typically paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, adding up to a loss of more than 400,000 over a lifetime. This wage gap varies by race and is larger for many women of color Black women working full time, year round typically make only 63 cents, Native American women only 60 cents, and Latinas only 55 cents, for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts. Latinas lose more than 1 million over a 40-year career due to the wage gap. While Asian American and Pacific Islander AAPI women make 85 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, many AAPI communities experience drastically wider pay gaps. And even when controlling for factors, such as education and experience, pay gaps persist and start early in womens careers and contribute to a wealth gap that follows them throughout their work lives and into retirement. Persistent pay discrimination, often cloaked by employer-imposed pay secrecy policies, is one factor driving these wage gaps. The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and strengthens the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it provides robust protection against sex-based pay discrimination. Among other provisions, this comprehensive bill ends secrecy around pay by barring retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages, and requiring employers to report pay data to the EEOC prohibits employers from relying on salary history in determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not follow women from job to job closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work without any important business justification related to the job ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex- based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity provides much needed training and technical assistance, as well as data collection and research The COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism have exposed how the work performed primarily by women, and particularly Black and brown women, has long been and continues to be undervalued and underpaid, even as the rest of the country is newly recognizing the essential nature of this work. We cannot build back an economy that works for everyone without ensuring that all women can work with equality, safety, and dignity, starting with pay equity. Passing the Paycheck Fairness Act would mark a vitally important step toward ensuring this becomes reality. We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections. Sincerely, Carolyn York, Secretary-Treasurer, National Committee on Pay Equity. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois Ms. Schakowsky. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 58th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act. Despite the goal to ensure equality for women in the workplace, nearly 60 years later, the pay gap still exists. Women today, on average, make 82 cents for every dollar earned by a man. For women of color, the disparity is worse, with Black women making 63 cents on the dollar, AAPI women making 60 cents, and Latinas making 55 cents. This disparity is unacceptable, and it is unfair. Let us come together right now to pass H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. When women get equal pay, our families and our entire economy will do better. I include in the Record a letter from the United Church of Christ in favor of H.R 7. United Church of Christ Dear Representative We are writing to ask for your support in passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7, and to ensure that passage in the House is done without amendments that diminish the protections provided by the bill. There is ample evidence to show that despite equal pay laws, the gender pay gap exists. These lost earnings add up to a loss of over 400,000 in a lifetime. The wage gap is even more significant for women of color Page H1810 with Black women working full time making only 63 cents for every dollar paid to men, Native American women only 60 cents, and Latinas only 55 cents, for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts. As people of faith, we believe that each person deserves to be treated with dignity and humanity. When women are paid less for the same work that is a concrete and explicit way of showing that their work and personhood are valued less. Passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act will strengthen and update the Equal Pay Act and provide women with the legal means to fight the gender pay gap and challenge gender pay discrimination. The work done by women, and particularly Black and brown women, is undervalued and underpaid. Even though much of that labor is what keeps people fed, clothed, and cared for. The work of women, so important to how a society functions is always relegated to less pay and less value. This is a gross injustice--and part of the systemic racist structures that undergird the economic system in the United States. Gods vision for our world is one where all are valued, no matter their gender, race, or credo. We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections. The United Church of Christ Justice and Witness Ministries Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia Mr. Allen. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, we all agree that every American should be compensated for the quality of their work and not face discrimination in the workplace based on race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. That is why Congress passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963 and broader nondiscrimination laws under title VII of the Civil Rights Act the following year. However, unlike those bills, H.R 7 offers no new protections. It is simply a messaging bill to score political points. What will the bill actually do? For job creators, they can expect more lawsuits and more regulatory burdens. While limiting legal options for women by changing EPA class action lawsuits from an opt-in system to a mandatory opt-out system, H.R 7 allows trial lawyers to pursue unlimited compensatory damages, making it nearly impossible for employers to defend against frivolous lawsuits. Additionally, it requires employers to make intrusive data disclosures to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regarding the sex, race, and national origin of employees and, for the first time, the hiring, termination, and promotion data of those employees, ultimately posing a threat to workers privacy. The compliance costs to satisfy these requirements can total more than 600 million a year. We have already seen a number of small businesses forced to close this year because of COVID lockdowns, and now my Democratic colleagues want to impose more regulatory burdens on businesses that were lucky enough to survive. Thankfully, my colleague from New York, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, has a solution that will actually address pay discrimination and support women in the workplace. The Wage Equity Act protects workers privacy by encouraging voluntary pay analysis while bolstering womens employment through the creation of a grant program for women in college or career and technical programs to provide negotiation skills education. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R 7 and work with Republicans on meaningful legislation to ensure all workers have the opportunity and wages they deserve. time 1315 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, could you advise us how much time is available on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 1414 minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from North Carolina has 1112 minutes remaining. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon Ms. Bonamici, the chair of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Human Services. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Paycheck Fairness Act. The Equal Pay Act has been the law for more than half a century, but, in 2021, equal pay for equal work is still not a reality for many women, especially women of color. This is an injustice to millions of working families. Closing the wage gap is an economic imperative. Last month, I was honored to chair the hearing on persistent gender- based wage discrimination. We heard witnesses describe the barriers to detecting wage discrimination and holding employers accountable. Most importantly, we heard how the Paycheck Fairness Act can address the problematic loopholes in the current law, empower workers to better detect and combat wage discrimination, and create mechanisms for better pay data transparency. By advancing the Paycheck Fairness Act, we can restore the original intent of the Equal Pay Act and finally make equal pay for equal work a reality. I thank Congresswoman DeLauro for her steadfast leadership. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act from the American Association of University Women. AAUW, April 14, 2021. Dear Representative On behalf of the more than 170,000 members and supporters of the American Association of University Women AAUW, I urge you to vote in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7 and to oppose harmful amendments when the bill comes to the House floor this week. Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender pay gaps persist. The Paycheck Fairness Act offers a much needed update to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to battle these pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination. The dual crises of a global pandemic and systemic racism have laid bare the economic disparities in our country. While we all struggle to survive, we are relying heavily on the work performed by essential workers who are disproportionately Black and brown women. Yet their work has long been and continues to be undervalued and underpaid. At the same time, in 2020, American women lost more than 5 million jobs. Women accounted for 100 of the jobs lost last December--all 140,000 of them--and women of color made up an overwhelming share of those jobs. This massive job loss coupled with the consistent undervaluing of womens work compounds over time and results in significant lost earnings. As a result, women do not have a financial cushion to help weather the current economic crisis or the ability to build wealth, all of which contribute to racial and gender wealth gaps that create barriers to families economic prosperity. We cannot build back our economy without immediately addressing these realities. And women and their families cannot afford to wait any longer for change. To appropriately respond to the crises we are currently experiencing we must make real, concrete progress in ensuring all women receive fair pay. While the gap has narrowed since passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, progress has largely stalled in recent years. Data from the U.S Census Bureau once again revealed that women working full-time, year-round are typically paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. The pay gaps are even wider for women of color. Black women and Latinas make, respectively, 63 and 55 cents on the dollar as compared to non-Hispanic, white men. Action is required now at the current rate, the overall pay gap between mens and womens earnings will not close until 2093 and it will take significantly longer for women of color to reach parity. Research indicates that the gender pay gap develops very early in womens careers. Controlling for factors known to affect earnings, such as education and training, marital status, and hours worked, research finds that college- educated women still earn 7 percent less than men just one year out of college. Over time, the gap compounds and widens, impacting womens social security and retirement. Ensuring that women have equal pay would have a dramatic impact on families and the economy. According to a report from the Institute for Womens Policy Research IWPR, the poverty rate for all working women would be cut in half, falling from 8.0 percent to 3.8 percent if women were paid the same as comparable men. The same study indicates that the U.S economy would have produced an additional 512.6 billion in income if women had received equal pay for equal work. This is why I urge you to pass this important bill. The Paycheck Fairness Act would update and strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it provides effective protection against sex-based pay discrimination in todays workplace. The bill takes several important steps, including Guaranteeing Non-Retaliation The bill prohibits retaliation against workers for discussing or disclosing wages. Without the non-retaliation provisions of the Paycheck Fairness Act, many women will continue to be silenced in the workplace--that is, prohibited from talking about wages with coworkers without the fear of being fired. This is an issue that keeps women--like it kept Lilly Ledbetter--from learning of the pay discrimination against them. Prohibiting Reliance on Prior Salary History The bill prohibits employers from relying on salary history in determining future pay, so that prior discrimination doesnt follow workers from job to job. Page H1811 Requiring Job-Relatedness The bill closes loopholes that allow employers to pay women less than men for the same work without a business necessity that is related to the job. Equalizing Remedies The bill ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity. Providing Additional Assistance and Resources The bill also provides technical assistance to businesses, requires wage data collection, and supports salary negotiation skills training programs to give women the tools to advocate for higher wages. The pay gap is persistent and can only be addressed if women are armed with the tools necessary to challenge discrimination against them, and employers are provided with effective incentives and technical assistance to comply with the law. I urge you to take a critical step towards pay equity by voting in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7 and opposing harmful amendments when the bill comes to the House floor this week. Cosponsorship and votes associated with this bill may be scored in the AAUW Action Fund Congressional Voting Record for the 117th Congress. Sincerely, Kate Nielson, Senior Director of Public Policy, Legal Advocacy amp Research. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Another provision in H.R 7 requires that, in addition to proving business necessity, an employer must prove the business necessity accounts for 100 percent of the differential in compensation at issue. This is impossible to do. How can an employer explain slight differences in compensation based on educational level, experience, or quality of work on the job? This bill is going to make it impossible for employers to pay differentially on merit for anything. It is a bad bill, and we should not be passing it. I urge my colleagues to vote no. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island Mr. Cicilline. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this Nation has made far too little progress in the fight for equal pay in the workplace. In 2021, women who work full time year round are paid, on average, only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. This adds up to over 400,000 in lost wages over the course of a womans career. For women of color, the gender gap is a gender chasm, with Latinas earning 55 cents, Black women earning 63 cents, and Asian American and Pacific Islander women earning a mere 52 cents for every dollar paid to a White man for the same work. The long overdue Paycheck Fairness Act would bring us closer to closing these gaps by ensuring equal pay for equal work. Notably, it would hold employers accountable for discriminatory practices, end pay secrecy, ease workers ability to challenge pay discrimination, and strengthen the available remedies for wronged employees. I thank Congresswoman DeLauro for her tireless advocacy on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the National Womens Law Center.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman DeLauro for her persistent leadership for so many years, as well as Chairman Scott and the Speaker. We must put an end to the wage gap and pay discrimination. Let me tell you, as you have heard, the wage gap for women of color is so much worse. I am reminded today of our heroine, Fannie Lou Hamer. She said, I am sick and tired of being sick and tired. Black women earn 63 cents, indigenous women earn 60 cents, Latinas earn 55 cents, White women earn 82 cents, and AAPI women are paid as little as 52 cents on every dollar paid to the White man. That is outrageous. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Equal Pay Today! campaign urging Members to support the bill. Equal Pay Today, April 14, 2021. Re Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7 and vote no on harmful amendments. Dear Representatives As the House votes on the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7, we strongly urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R 7, without amendments that would limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. As members of the Equal Pay Today Campaign, we represent a broad coalition consisting of both national and state based organizations from all across the country, that are dedicated to challenging the legal, policy, and cultural barriers at the local, state, and national level that keep women from being paid equally. Launched on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the federal Equal Pay Act, we are committed to fighting and advocating for legislation that will ultimately close the gender wage gap. With our nation now entering into year two of this global pandemic, we can no longer ignore the disparities that have existed long before our nations shutdown, and Page H1812 despite federal and state equal pay laws, the gender pay gap persists, and earnings lost to these gaps are widened due to the financial impacts of the pandemic, with a heavier burden bared by women of color and the families and communities who depend on them and their income. Women are increasingly becoming the primary or co- breadwinner in their families, with Black mothers being far more likely than other mothers to be the primary or sole breadwinners for their families and more than half of Latina mothers being the breadwinner in families with children under 18. Women across this country, working full-time, year-round, are typically being paid only .82 cents for every dollar paid out to men, adding up to a loss of more than 400,000 dollars over a lifetime. And the wage gap gets even wider as race is factored in. Black women working full time, year round typically make only .63 cents, Native American women only .60 cents, and Latinas only .55 cents, for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts. Latinas stand to lose more than 1 million over a 40-year career due to the wage gap, and while Asian American and Pacific Islander AAPI women make .85 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, many AAPI communities experience drastically wider pay gaps. And even when controlling for factors, such as education and experience, the pay gaps still persist, start early in womens careers and contribute to a wealth gap that follows them throughout their lifetimes. These pay gaps can be addressed and rectified through legislation that offers workers the legal tools and safeguards needed to challenge discrimination. The Paycheck Fairness Act, which has already been passed by the House of Representatives three times before and most recently by the 116th Congress, would offer the much needed updates to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by making these tools available while also providing new ones, that would help to combat and challenge discrimination and the pay gap. The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and strengthens the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it provides robust protection against sex-based pay discrimination. Among other provisions, this comprehensive bill ends secrecy around pay by barring retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages, and requiring employers to report pay data to the EEOC prohibits employers from relying on salary history in determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not follow women from job to job closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work without any important business justification related to the job ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex- based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity provides much needed training and technical assistance, as well as data collection and research This past year has undoubtedly been a challenging one. The pandemic has shone a light on how the work performed by women, specifically Black and brown women, has continuously been undervalued, underpaid, and gone unnoticed. We cannot continue to use the word essential to describe the nature of this work, if there is no commitment to ensuring that all women can work with safety and with dignity, and the first step to making this happen, starts with pay equity, and the catalyst for this would be the passing of the Paycheck Fairness Act. We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Equal Pay Today. Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, let me finally say Remember, because of this discrimination, womens Social Security benefits during their senior years are much lower than men. This injustice follows women throughout their lives. This issue impacts women, regardless of industry, education level or political party. It is past time--it is so past time for Congress to take action on this. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote yes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R 7 would create impossible conditions in which to operate for businessowners large and small. It would result in endless litigation in front of judges and juries, who will delve into employer compensation decisions even when there has been a showing that those decisions are not based on sex. Alternatively, businessowners will simply decide not to risk liability of unlimited damages, which could bankrupt them, and the end result will be the use of pay bands by employers, which imposes a government civil service model on the private sector that will result in everyone in the workplace being compensated equally without regard to merit. This is a very broad goal of liberals in general Pay everybody the same and stifle innovation, stifle initiative, stifle anybody being different. This is the wrong thing for our country. That is not the way the United States of America operates. We value innovation, we value entrepreneurism, we value independent thinking. We dont want to crush everybody into thinking the same way. That is the way civil service works. That is the way the unions work. That is not the way it should be in private industry, which has made this country great. This bill stalls upward mobility. It hurts all employees striving to succeed on the job, who want to be rewarded for their efforts. For these reasons and others, H.R 7s provisions are unworkable and will benefit only trial lawyers, not innovative, hardworking workers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California Ms. Pelosi, the distinguished Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor of the House. This is about building back better with women, not stifling innovation and entrepreneurship, but reaping the benefits of all that women have to offer in our country. Mr. Speaker, nearly 60 years ago, President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law, lauding it as a measure that adds to our laws another structure basic to democracy. Today, I rise in support of a similarly momentous measure for our democracy, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will strengthen that law and reaffirm this pledge equal work deserves equal pay. We all salute Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, the guardian angel of this legislation, and so much of what Democrats work on behalf of women and families. Chairwoman DeLauro is relentless, introducing this bill in each of the last 13 Congresses and securing bipartisan support and the support of the entire House Democratic Caucus. And now, because of her leadership, we have a chance for it to become law. Many of us, with Chair DeLauro at the helm, have helped lead the charge for equal pay for many years now. Twelve years ago, House Democrats passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to protect womens right to challenge unfair pay in the courts. We are proud that President Obama made this bill the first bill he signed into law. You talked about it earlier, Mr. Chairman. Exactly 10 years later, when Democrats retook the majority, we were honored to stand with Lilly Ledbetter, that courageous woman, as we took another step forward for pay equity by again introducing Congresswoman DeLauros bill, the Paycheck Fairness Act. Today, a Democratic Congress led by over 120 women in the House with an administration led by President Biden, a longtime champion of women and the first woman Vice President, Kamala Harris and with a record number of women in the Cabinet, those are great advances for women. We will pass this landmark bill once more, send it to the Senate, and then, hopefully, to President Biden to sign into law. I am the mother of four daughters. I dont know anybody who has a daughter, a wife, a sister, a mother who can say to them, You are not worth it your time is not worth the time of your brother, your father, your whoever else. What father, brother or son would not want the women in their lives to have equal pay? Sadly, equal pay is not yet a reality in America. Nearly six decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, women working full time year round are paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. And for women of color, the disparity is even greater. It is almost sinful. For Black women, it is 63 cents Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, AmericanIndian, and Alaska Native women, 60 cents and a Latina is making just 55 cents for every dollar for the same work as men. Equal work, equal hours, equal efforts, but not equal pay. And this is not just about cents on a dollar. This pay Page H1813 gap can add up to about 400,000 in lost wages over a career. What does that mean to a womans pension? At the same time, the need for action has been accelerated by the pandemic, which has worsened economic disparities for women. Last year, women lost a net 5.4 million jobs during the recession, with losses disproportionately experienced by women of color. This unjust, uneven toll on women is expected to widen the wage gap by up to 5 percentage points. Widen the gap by 5 percentage points, even as the economy recovers. As the House passes this landmark legislation, let us stand proudly, unapologetically for what this does for the economy of our country. We continue to work to advance progress for women and families. With the strong support of President Biden, the House Democrats are proud to have passed and sent to the Senate our bipartisan VAWA reauthorization led by Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee legislation to remove the arbitrary deadline for ERA ratification led by Congresswoman Jackie Speier and to have enacted the American Rescue Plan, which is helping many women to return to the workforce. time 1330 And we will continue this drumbeat of action ensuring that the Senate passes the Paycheck Fairness Act and advancing legislation to strengthen womens access to childcare, healthcare, workplace safety, and more. And as we move forward to build back better, President Bidens alliterative phrase for how we have job creation in our country, we can only build back better if women are central to that effort. Advancing an economy in a country that works for all of the people in America is very important to Americas families and Americas children. I urge a strong and, hopefully, bipartisan vote on H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. Fairness is an all-American quality. Fairness for women is essential because we know that when women succeed, America succeeds. I thank Congresswoman DeLauro and Chairman Scott for their leadership. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 112 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania Mr. Meuser. Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Foxx very much for yielding. I appreciate the opportunity to speak, Mr. Speaker. All Americans, men and women, should be treated equally and receive equal pay for equal work. I happen to be the father of two daughters, and I will do everything in this House to ensure that that continues to be the case and is, in fact, the case. If this truly were an Equal Pay Act, Mr. Speaker, I think we would have a bipartisan initiative here. We would have bipartisan agreement. The problem is this is not what it is, Mr. Speaker, it goes well beyond dealing with equal pay. What it does is it provides equal pay for as many attorneys and trial lawyers as possible. And therein lies the problem. Once again, we have what looks like legitimate legislation that sounds good and feels good, Mr. Speaker, yet when you look at the details, it is far left extremism, which poisons the legislation and doesnt allow reasonable Members like myself to be supportive. And this isnt the first time. This occurs very often, and it is the reason why we dont get things done, nor do we get bipartisan cooperation. Because cooperation is the way that we will achieve and complete bills of importance, particularly that are named equal pay for all, equality for all. That is what our goal is. It would be great if a bill like this had the substance that provided the ingredients to provide for equal pay. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland Mr. Hoyer, the majority leader of the United States House of Representatives. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia, the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee for yielding, and I thank him for his untiring work. No employer . . . shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex, by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex. That was passed by the Congress of the United States, signed by the President of the United States in 1963. A half a century later, Mr. Speaker, the figures belie that promise. The figures are a shameful recognition of the emptiness of that promise. Now, I know the gentlewoman from North Carolina, not well, but well enough. We have served here together for some period of time. I hope she will take this with a measure of positivity. She is a feisty lady. She stands up for what she believes. And she is tough. All those things are said lovingly. God help us if they paid her less than they paid every male Member of this House. But we dont. We pay everybody the same, except, I will admit, the Speaker and myself, so perhaps I am not quite as detached. But everybody else gets the same. A person who comes in the first day gets paid as much as a person who has been here 40 years like me. Why? Because it is the responsibility and duties that we perform that are being compensated, not our gender. Now, in this bill and every other bill that has dealt with equal pay--however, let there be no mistake, clearly, I pay people in my office who have been there for 10 years more than I pay people that have been there a year if they are doing the same thing. Period. Experience counts. As a lawyer when I ran my law office, I paid people differently based upon their experience, their education, and other differentials, but not on the basis of gender. And like the gentleman who spoke before me, I have one more daughter than he has he has two daughters, I have three daughters. Mr. Speaker, they would not be happy today if their dad came to this floor and voted against this bill, I will tell you that. I dont know about the gentlemans daughters, but I can tell you where my daughters would be. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to bring the Paycheck Fairness Act to the floor, as I did last Congress. The legislation is a critical part of Democrats effort to close the gender pay gap and ensure that women earn equal pay for equal work. Lilly Ledbetter did not get equal pay for equal work. Period. Unfortunately, she was prevented by the Supreme Court from making her case. We corrected that. The House passed a bill in 2019, but the Republican-controlled Senate failed to do the same, a bill just like this. That was very disappointing, not only to those of us who have been working hard to close the gender pay gap in Congress, but more so to the tens of millions of people in the workforce who deserve to take home pay they have earned. This is not a gift. This is compensation based upon ability and contribution, not on gender. In America today, a woman still earns on average just 82 cents to every dollar earned by a man. Mr. Chairman, has that been disputed on this floor? From women of color it is even worse. African-American women earn on average only 63 cents to the dollar, while Latinas see 55 cents for the same work. For women who work full time, year-round, the gender pay gap represents a loss of more than, as the Speaker just said, 400,000. That ought to be unacceptable to all of us if we believe in equality. This disparity does not only hurt women, it disadvantages their entire families, with womens pay critical to household incomes. Two-thirds of women are now either the primary breadwinner or co- breadwinner of their households, and womens earnings are the main source of income in more than 4 in 10 households, 40 percent. Now, the gentlewoman from North Carolina knows full well that historically we have underpaid women because we thought men were the breadwinners. They were the people who earned the money. They were the people who needed money so they could support their families. That is not true today, if it was ever true. Those households ought not to be disadvantaged because women are paid less for the same work as their male counterparts. I mentioned in 1963 the promise we made as a Nation. In 2009, when I was majority leader for the first time, I was proud to bring the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to the floor and get it passed. Page H1814 I congratulate Rosa DeLauro who is on the floor today, Mr. Speaker. She has been indefatigable and focused and untiring--I suppose that is redundant--in her efforts to ensure that women were treated equally. And one of the best ways to treat people equally is pay them the same thing for the same job. The Paycheck Fairness Act builds on its success by making it harder for businesses to hide the underpayment of women in their employ through nondisclosure contracts and imposing new civil penalties for those who violate equal pay rules, among other beneficial provisions. Now, this has been in effect for half a century, and we havent gotten there. Do we need some, yeah, lets get it done, this is what the law said in 1963? And we really meant it. So lets carry that out so when the bipartisan, nonpartisan reports are made as to who is making what for the same job, it will come back men and women are getting the same pay for the same job with the same skills and the same seniority. I hope the Senate will take up this long overdue legislation and pass it so President Biden can sign it into law and at long last make good on the promise of the Equal Pay Act nearly six decades ago. I thank my friend, as I just did, Rosa DeLauro for the work she has done. I thank Ms. DeLauro on behalf of Susan, on behalf of Stefany, on behalf of Anne, my daughters, on behalf of Judy and Ava and Brooklyn and Savannah, my three great granddaughters and my granddaughter. What she has done, what we can do will make a difference for them, their families, and our country. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the majority leader for his compliments of me. When Howard Coble first introduced me to the Republican Conference here he said, I was a feisty mountain woman from the Blue Ridge, who goes bear hunting with a switch. And so I have cherished that description of me over the years. I am a feisty woman because I grew up extraordinarily poor. And the majority leader is correct, I would not tolerate discrimination against me. I wont tolerate discrimination against anyone. I abhor discrimination. I am also an Italian American. I abhor that kind of discrimination and have fought against that. I fought against racial discrimination. I doubt there are many people in this body that fought more against discrimination against women than I have or mentored more women than I have. However, the majority leader also said something that made me think of the phrase, all things being equal. Well, rarely are all things equal. Obviously, when all things are equal, we want no discrimination, everybody to be treated the same. That is what I want. I have one child, a daughter. I have two grandchildren, a grandson and a granddaughter. I certainly dont want either one of them discriminated against on the basis of anything. But, I say to Mr. Hoyer, yes, 82 cents has been disputed. We hear the same old tired statistics. They are not accurate. So lets stop doing that. Lets deal with the facts. H.R 7 is not the answer to discrimination. It is going to make it more difficult for employers to create jobs and to pay women and everybody equally. We need alternatives and we have one. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on both sides, please? The SPEAKER pro tempore Mr. McEachin. The gentleman from Virginia has 914 minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from North Carolina has 412 minutes remaining. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan Mrs. Lawrence, a co-chair of the Democratic Womens Caucus. time 1345 Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, it is beyond me that in 2021 we are still having this debate on whether men and women are paid equally. And I just want to say to my colleague on the other side, being a Black woman in America, I can tell you I do not feel that she has had the discrimination and the disrespect in the pay scale that women of color have experienced. And during the brunt of this pandemic where women are in the forefront, those who are frontline workers, the service industry--predominantly women. Paycheck fairness corrects this injustice by allowing women to challenge pay discrimination and hold employers accountable. Many in this Chamber like to talk about leveling the playing field for all Americans. Then lets do it by passing this bill. And in America, when you walk in the room as a woman, you know you have overcome and you have work to do. And please dont continue to disrespect us by saying that everything is okay. In your world it may be, but today we can correct that. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I have never said everything is perfectly okay. I said this bill is not the answer to what issues may still exist out there. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Iowa Mrs. Miller-Meeks, and applaud her for how she has handled herself in the past few months through all the turmoil and all of the challenges she has had. Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National Federation of Independent Businesses opposing H.R 7. NFIB, Washington, DC, March 24, 2021. Hon. Bobby Scott, Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Virginia Foxx, Ranking Member, Committee on Education and Labor, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx On behalf of NFIB, the nations leading small business advocacy organization, I write in opposition to H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. This legislation will add significant burdens to small businesses and potentially expose them to frivolous lawsuits. NFIB and its members believe in equal pay for equal work. However, NFIB does not believe that this legislation is the solution. H.R 7 will make legitimate business-related pay differences difficult to defend in court, invite frivolous lawsuits against small business owners by allowing unlimited compensatory and punitive damages in equal pay lawsuits, and significantly increase small business paperwork burdens. This legislation would make it nearly impossible for a small employer to defend against claims where an alternative employment practice exists and could serve the same business purpose without producing a wage differential. Even if an employer were to demonstrate that a legitimate factor such as education, training, or experience accounted for a wage differential, an employee could claim that an alternative employment practice existed and that the employer refused to adopt such a practice. For example, an employee of a small, local hardware store would be able to sue an employer for refusing to adopt a business practice that a much larger company uses to address wage discrepancies. Forcing one-size-fits-all legislation on small, independent businesses puts them at a significant disadvantage relative to their larger competitors. A small business may have legitimate reasons for not adopting the practices of a large business. However, if an employee can prove that the independent business refused to adopt the alternative employment practice of a large competitor, the small business automatically loses the suit. This legislation also prohibits an employer from asking a prospective employee about wage history and prohibits an employer from relying on wage history in determining wages. These prohibitions create a very difficult situation for small business owners. A persons written resume is only one aspect of the application process a persons salary history is another essential part of gauging professional growth and development. If the needs of a prospective employee and the wants of a business do not match, the prospective employee and the business should be able to discern this sooner rather than later to avoid wasting each partys time and energy. By eliminating salary history, the hiring process becomes less precise and more difficult for small employers. This bill also puts significant paperwork burdens on small business owners. It requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC to issue regulations providing for the collection of employers compensation data. Most small business owners do not have a human resources department or a full-time staff member in charge of reporting and compliance. NFIB members find unreasonable government regulations to be their sixth biggest problem and federal paperwork to be their 15th biggest problem when ranking their top 75 problems and priorities. Page H1815 NFIB strongly opposes H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, urges the committee to oppose the legislation in its current form. Sincerely, Kevin Kuhlman, Vice President, Federal Government Relations. Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to introduce this as a small business owner myself. The NFIB letter says H.R 7 will add significant burdens to small businesses and potentially expose them to frivolous lawsuits. In addition, the bill will make legitimate business-related pay differences difficult to defend in court, invite frivolous lawsuits against small business owners by allowing unlimited compensatory and punitive damages in equal pay lawsuits, and significantly increase small business paperwork burdens. Moreover, the NFIB letter says that H.R 7 will make it nearly impossible for a small employer to defend against claims where an alternative employment practice exists and could serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. The letter also highlights the significant paperwork burdens H.R 7 would place on small businesses who do not have a human resources department, a full-time staff member in charge, or attorneys for reporting and compliance. Mr. Speaker, having been a small business owner and supported by the small business owners, and during the pandemic when it is so necessary for us to get our small businesses up and operating, I urge my colleagues to take these views of small business owners into consideration before they vote on H.R 7. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from North Carolina Ms. Ross. Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this bill is not just about the past, it is about the future. Gender-based wage discrimination exists in every State and in many industries. In the tech industry, which has a huge presence in my district in North Carolinas Research Triangle, women typically make thousands of dollars less than men in the same roles. Unsurprisingly, women in tech often leave the industry due to unfair compensation, much to that industrys detriment. Pay inequity also follows women into retirement. Women have, on average, only 70 percent of the retirement income men have. One of the best ways we can help close the wage gap is through salary negotiation training, which is one of the key provisions of this bill. I am thankful to groups like Ladies Get Paid and countless others working to empower women to help them advocate for their work. I urge my colleagues to support this bill for the sake of future generations. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter from the National Council of Jewish Women. National Council of Jewish Women, Washington, DC, April 14, 2021. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative On behalf of our 180,000 members, advocates, and supporters, National Council of Jewish Women NCJW urges you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7 without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. NCJW is a grassroots organization of volunteers and advocates who turn progressive ideals into action. Inspired by Jewish values, NCJW strives for social justice by improving the quality of life for women, children, and families and by safeguarding individual rights and freedoms. The Torah compels us tzedek, tzedek tirdof--to pursue justice. To that end, we advocate for employment laws, policies, and practices that provide equal pay and benefits for work of comparable worth and equal opportunities for advancement. Nearly 60 years after passage of the landmark Equal Pay Act, the gender way gap persists. Overall, women earn only 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, and the gap is much wider for women of color Black women earn 63 cents, Indigenous women earn 60 cents, Latinas earn 55 cents, and some Asian American and Pacific Islander women earn only 52 cents. Earnings lost to these gaps are exacerbating the financial effects of COVID-19, falling particularly heavily on women of color and the families who depend on their income. The Paycheck Fairness Act, which has been passed three previous times by the House of Representatives, mostly recently in the 116th Congress, offers a much needed update to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to battle pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination. We cannot build back an economy that works for everyone without ensuring that all women can work with equality, safety, and dignity, starting with pay equity. Passing the Paycheck Fairness Act would mark a vitally important step toward ensuring this becomes reality. I ask you to vote YES on the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7 without amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical protections. Sincerely, Jody Rabhan, Chief Policy Officer, National Council of Jewish Women. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Missouri Ms. Bush. Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of YWCAUSA, I include in the Record a letter of support for H.R 7. YWCA, April 13, 2021. Dear Representative On behalf of YWCAUSA, a network of over 200 local associations in 45 states and the District of Columbia, I write today to urge the Representative to support the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7 and vote no on harmful amendments. As the economy continues to struggle under the weight of the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affecting women and marginalized communities, there is no better time to take action to improve the economic security of women and families and strengthen our economy. I urge you to pass this bill without amendments that limit its scope or undermines its critical protections. For over 160 years, YWCA has been on a mission to eliminate racism, empower women, and promote peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all. From our earliest days providing skills and housing support to women entering the workforce in the 1850s, YWCA has been at the forefront of the most pressing social movements--from voting rights to civil rights, from affordable housing to pay equity, from violence prevention to health care reform. Today, we serve over 2 million women, girls and family members of all ages and backgrounds in more than 1,200 communities each year. Informed by our extensive history, the expertise of our nationwide network, and our collective commitment to advocating for the equity of women and families, we believe that no one should have to choose between their livelihoods and their health, family, or safety. Yet far too women and families, including a disproportionate number of women and families of color, must make this choice every day. This has become more clear as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic become more transparent. The impact of the pandemic has fallen heavily on women and women of color. Women are especially likely to be essential workers, but they are also bearing the brunt of job losses, while shouldering increased caregiving responsibilities that have pushed millions out of the workforce entirely, resulting in an economic Shesession. Black women, Latinas, and other women of color are especially likely to be on the front lines of the crisis, risking their lives in jobs in health care, child care, and grocery stores, all while being paid less than their male counterparts. The bipartisan Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7 would help close longstanding gender and racial wage gaps by updating and strengthening the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and ensure robust protections against sex-based pay discrimination. Today, on average, women in the United States earn only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, amounting to an annual gender wage gap of 10,157. Unfortunately, this gap is worse for women of color. Among women who hold full-time, year-round jobs in the United States, Black women are typically paid 63 cents, Native American women 60 cents and Latinas just 55 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. White, non- Hispanic women are paid 79 cents and Asian American women 87 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, and Asian American and Pacific Islander women of some ethnic and national backgrounds fare much worse. The COVID-19 global pandemic has exposed deepening economic disparities, further unveiling how the work performed primarily by women, and particularly women of color, has long been and continues to be undervalued and underpaid. It is time Congress addressed these deepening disparities and take steps towards real economic change for women by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. We cannot afford to shortchange women as a result of persistent gender pay gaps and we urge the Representative to pass this bill without delay. YWCAUSA urges the Representative to protect womens economic security and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7 and take critical steps towards strengthening womens economic security, particularly at a time when the country begins to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. At this pivotal moment, Congress must take aggressive action to address the economic disparities disproportionately affecting women and women of color. We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7 without harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Elisha Rhodes, Interim CEO amp Chief Operating Officer. Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise in full support of H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. Page H1816 As a nurse, I earned around 60 percent of what my White male counterparts in the same position earned. I have often imagined how many people in my district experienced the same burdens, like how much overtime and missing wages we could have accrued every single month. We have been chronically underpaid and chronically undervalued. I have stood up to fight for underpaid nurses before and I stand here today to fight for underpaid women, especially women of color everywhere. Pay Black, pay Brown, pay indigenous, pay AAPI women what were worth. Run us our money and run us our money now. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania Ms. Dean. Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for leading and for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act. It has been more than five decades since the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, yet a woman still earns only 82 cents on average for every dollar earned by her male counterpart. Women of color fare much worse. The Paycheck Fairness Act will ensure equal pay for equal work. It is just that simple and it is just that overdue. Gender and racial pay gaps persist, and earnings lost to these gaps are felt even more during the COVID-19 pandemic. This falls most heavily on women. The Paycheck Fairness Act will update and strengthen the Equal Pay Act to help close this gap. Pay inequities not only affect women, it affects children and their families. Though we have made strides in the past, we know the issue of equal pay persists. We must not pass this inequity on. I want my granddaughters, Aubrey and Ella, as well as my grandson, Sawyer, to live in a country where equal pay for equal work is the norm. I thank chairwoman and champion Rosa DeLauro. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan Ms. Tlaib. Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, did you know that over 40 percent of mothers are sole or primary breadwinners for their families? It has been over 50 years since the Equal Pay Act was signed into law, yet the problems that preceded that legislation remain today. So it is time for the Paycheck Fairness Act. Mr. Speaker, across the country, women are paid 80 cents to the dollar that men are paid, and the number is significantly lower for women of color. Black women make roughly 60 percent to the dollar. Native-American women make about 57 cents. And Latina women make just over 50 to the dollar. The discriminatory wage gap is costing women thousands of dollars a year for doing the exact same work as their male counterparts. And I see this right here in my community and my district where women are forced to work longer hours, harder, just to make ends meet and put food on the table for their families. My community is one of the poorest in the Nation, and the wage gap is one of the biggest factors for families who are really trying to get out of the cycle of poverty and get the support for their children so they can thrive. I am grateful to my colleagues on the Committee on Education and Labor for bringing this long overdue legislation. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas Ms. Jackson Lee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia and thank him for his leadership--also, the Speaker and the ranking member. According to the National Womens Law Center, based on todays wage gap, a woman who works full-time year-round would typically lose 406,280 over her 40-year career. This means a woman making the median national salary for women would have to work almost 9 years longer than her male counterpart. Mr. Speaker, 58 years after the enactment of the Equal Pay Act, full- time working women still earn 82 cents on average for every dollar a man earns, amounting to a yearly gap of almost 20,000. They, too, raise children. They, too, have overhead. In this pandemic year, we have found that 2 million women have lost their jobs. We know that Hispanic women earn 55 cents, Native-American women 60 cents, and African-American women, on average, only 63 cents. It is time now to put this paycheck fairness bill on the desk of the President of the United States. It modernizes and strengthens the Equal Pay Act, which is what the Lilly Ledbetter Act was, and brings the country one step closer to ensuring that women can receive equal pay for equal work. Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor, a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, on the Budget, and a member of the Democratic Working Womens Task Force, I rise in strong support of H.R 7, the landmark Paycheck Fairness Act, which strengthens and closes loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, including providing effective remedies for workers who are not being paid equal pay for equal work. I thank my colleague, the Chair of the Committee on Appropriations, Congresswoman DeLauro, for introducing the Paycheck Fairness Act in every Congress since 1997, which enabled me join her as an original cosponsor all during those years as we fought shoulder to shoulder for womens equality and empowerment. Mr. Speaker, in January 2009, the Democratic-led 111th Congress sent to the Presidents desk the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first bill signed into law by President Obama, which restored the critical rights of workers to challenge unfair pay in court. Now, a Democratic-led House will push for enactment of another critical fair pay bill--the Paycheck Fairness Act that strengthens current law. When House has been controlled by a Democratic majority, the Paycheck Fairness Act has passed several times--including in the 110th Congress, the 111th Congress, and the 116th Congress, when it passed by a bipartisan vote of 242 to 187 on March 27, 2019, before dying in then- Senate Majority Leader McConnells legislative graveyard. This is the year to finish the job and send this critical legislation all the to President Bidens desk for signature. Mr. Speaker, as every woman Member of Congress knows, as our mother, sisters, daughters, and sorors in the workplace know all too well, the impact of the wage gap grows throughout a womans career. According to the National Womens Law Center, based on todays wage gap, a woman who worked full-time, year-round would typically lose 406,280 over a 40-year career. This means a woman making the median national salary for women would have to work almost nine years longer than her male counterpart to make up this lifetime wage gap. Mr. Speaker, 58 years after the enactment of the Equal Pay Act, full- time working women still earn just 82 cents, on average, for every dollar a man earns, amounting to a yearly gap of 10,157 between full- time working men and women. The wage gap is also even larger for women of color. Hispanic women on average earn only 55 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. Native American women on average earn only 60 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. African American women on average earn only 63 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. The National Partnership for Women and Families has calculated that 10,157 for a median family in America means more than 9 additional months of rent or 13 additional months of childcare. Indeed, if women were paid the same as men, the poverty rate for all working women would be cut in half and the poverty rate for working single mothers would be cut by nearly half. Because of loopholes in the law and weak sanctions for violations, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not provided the tools to truly combat unequal pay. The Paycheck Fairness Act modernizes and strengthens the Equal Pay Act and brings the country one step closer to ensuring that women receive equal pay for equal work in the following ways 1. Requires employers to prove that pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons and puts the burden on employers to show the disparity is not sex-based, but job-related and necessary 2. Bans retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages 3. Ensures women receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and national origin Page H1817 4. Removes obstacles in the Equal Pay Act to facilitate a wronged workers participation in class action lawsuits that challenge systemic pay discrimination 5. Makes improvements in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissions EEOCs and the Department of Labors tools for enforcing the Equal Pay Act 6. Provides assistance to all businesses to help them with their equal pay practices, recognizes excellence in pay practices by businesses, and empowers women and girls by creating a negotiation skills training program and 7. Prohibits employers from seeking salary history in determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not follow women from job to job. Finally, equal pay is not simply a womens issue, but a family issue. Two-thirds of mothers are either the sole breadwinner or a co- breadwinner in the household, so their earnings are vital to their families. When women bring home less money each day, it means they have less for the everyday needs of their families--groceries, rent, childcare, and doctors visits. The Paycheck Fairness Act is strongly endorsed by a coalition of more than 200 organizations, including AAUW, National Womens Law Center, National Partnership for Women and Families, National Organization for Women, National Committee on Pay Equity, MomsRising, UltraViolet, Center for Law and Social Policy, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, NAACP, League of Women Voters, U.S Womens Chamber of Commerce, AFL-CIO, SEIU, United Steelworkers, AFSCME, American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, American Psychological Association, Anti-Defamation League, and many more. I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act of 2021, to ensure effective remedies for workers who are not being paid equal pay for equal work. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Women, in terms of employment and pay, have made great strides in this country. When I was graduating from high school, basically there were three open professions for women nursing, teaching, and being a secretary. We have come a long way. We have also come a long way in terms of wages. Do we have ways to go in this country in terms of the way everybody thinks about people who are different from them? We certainly do. Republicans and Democrats both agree that pay discrimination is repugnant and illegal. I will say it again and again. It is repugnant and illegal. Despite misguided claims from the other side, this underlying principle is not up for debate. Women should not be paid less than men for equal work. However, Republicans are not in the business of passing radical and prescriptive bills just to get flashy headlines and score cheap political points. We are equally committed to promoting both fairness and strong policymaking, and when judged by these standards, todays bill falls woefully short. Pay discrimination is illegal. You know, we have really heard nothing about the inadequacies of the current law or the current processes. What we have heard is that we need new legislation. Republicans disagree with that. Again, we want pay discrimination to be illegal and we want any such cases to be treated seriously and to be looked at. This bill offers no new protection against pay discrimination in the workplace, however. And that is sorely lacking in this bill. Mr. Speaker, H.R 7 is nothing more than a trial lawyer payout at the expense of hardworking women. I urge a no vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this is a critical time to secure equal pay for equal work. Over the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has driven over 2 million women out of the workforce. As women return to the workplace, failure to strengthen the equal pay protections will exacerbate and entrench the gender wage gap for years to come. Mr. Speaker, we all know that discrimination exists. The Paycheck Fairness Act will allow victims the tools they need to combat and also close loopholes that allows employers to escape liability for discriminatory pay differences. Today, we are talking about financial security for millions of families. Sixty-four percent of mothers are either the sole family breadwinner or co-breadwinner. We cannot continue to allow gender-based pay inequity to rob half of all workers and their families the wages they deserve. The Paycheck Fairness Act is our chance to finally help close the gender wage gap by reinforcing the Equal Pay Act and strengthening protections for working women. The bill would ensure that gender equality on the job is not an aspiration but a reality. Madam Speaker, I ask our colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I have strongly supported the Paycheck Fairness Act and have done so for over two decades. When the legislation finally got a vote in the House in 2008, I voted yes I voted yes again in 2009 and 2019. I have cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act since 2015. In January, I again enthusiastically cosponsored H.R 7--the Paycheck Fairness Act. In late March, however, H.R 7 was radically altered during markup in the Education and Labor Committee with a new definition of sex that according to serious legal analysis will compel employers to subsidize abortion on demand. Because I respect the inherent dignity and value of unborn baby girls and boys who will be put at grave risk of death by dismemberment abortion and chemical poisoning if H.R 7 is enacted in its current form, I will vote no today. In a letter dated April 14, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said H.R 7 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA. The FLSA, among other things, prohibits unequal wages between men and women performing equal work. 29 U.S.C Sec. 206dl. Wages include all forms of remuneration, including frinqe benefits such as medical, hospital, and accident . . . insurance, life insurance, retirement benefits, and leave. 29 C.F.R 1620.10, 1620.11 Strengthening federal law to ensure equal compensation for equal work as between men and women is a laudable legislative goal, and we heartily endorse that goal . . . Unfortunately, H.R 7 has moved in a different direction . . . We believe that if the bill were to pass, the Fair Labor Standards Act could be construed to require employers, including even religious organizations, to cover and pay for abortions . . . we urge members to oppose the redefinition of sex in H.R 7 and instead revert to the version of the bill that passed the House in the 116th Congress. The National Right to Life Committee opposed the redefinition of sex and opposes the bill. They said in a letter H.R 7 makes definitional changes to sex to include pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition. It is well established that abortion will be regarded as a related medical condition. See 29C.F.R.pt.1604 App.1986 and Doe v. CARS Protection Plus, lnc., 527F.3d 358 3dCir.2008. Historically, when Congress has addressed discrimination based on sex, rules of construction have been added to prevent requiring funding of abortion. Since there is no rule of construction that would make this legislation abortion-neutral, it is likely that H.R 7 could be used to sue employers for a lack of elective abortion coverage. In like manner, the Susan B. Anthony List opposes the bill noting that H.R 7 amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 by adding pregnancy childbirth, or a related medical condition to the definition of sex, which courts have interpreted broadly to include abortion. Other pro-life organizations urged a no vote including March for Life Action. Madam Speaker, underscoring my commitment to the legislation without the redefinition of the term sex, yesterday I introduced H.R 2490-- the Paycheck Fairness Act with the identical H.R 7 language from January. H.R 2490 is needed to ensure that the noble goals embedded in the landmark law, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, are achieved. Among its provisions H.R 2490 Prohibits employers from seeking the salary history of prospective employees. By banning reliance on salary history in determining future pay, the bill ensures that prior pay discrimination doesnt follow workers from job to job. Bans retaliation against workers who discuss their wages. Improves research on the gender pay gap. The bill instructs DOL to conduct studies and review available research and data to provide information on how to identify, correct, and eliminate illegal wage disparities. Requires the collection of wage data from federal contractors and directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC to Page H1818 conduct a survey of available wage information and create a system of wage data in order to help the Department of Labor uncover wage discrimination. Provides a small business exception. The Equal Pay Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act have an exemption for small businesses that generate less than 500,000 in annual revenues a year, and the Paycheck Fairness Act would keep that exemption intact. Supports small businesses with technical assistance. Provides assistance to all businesses to help them with their equal pay practices, recognize excellence in pay practices by businesses, and empower workers by creating a negotiation skills training program. I include in the Record the following letters of opposition. United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Washington, DC, April 14, 2021. Dear Representative We write to raise pro-life and other concerns about the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R 7. H.R 7 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act. The FLSA, among other things, prohibits unequal wages between men and women performing equal work. 29 U.S.C Sec. 206dl. Wages include all forms of remuneration, including fringe benefits such as medical, hospital, and accident . . . insurance, life insurance, retirement benefits, and leave. 29 C.F.R Sec. Sec. 1620.10, 1620.11 Strengthening federal law to ensure equal compensation for equal work as between men and women is a laudable legislative goal, and we heartily endorse that goal. See Economic Justice for All, no. 167 1986, Particular attention is needed to achieve pay equity between men and women Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, no. 295 2004 An urgent need to recognize effectively the rights of women in the workplace is seen especially under the aspects of pay, insurance and social security. Pope Francis, Audience with Delegates from the Confederation of Trade Unions in Italy June 28, 2017 And what I am about to say may seem obvious, but in the world of work women are still in second class. You might say, No, but there is that businesswoman, that other one . . . yes, but if women earn less, are more easily exploited . . . do something.. Indeed, Congress could do more in this area. Unfortunately, H.R 7 has moved in a different direction. On March 24, the House Committee on Education and Labor marked up the bill to redefine the term .. sex to include such items as sex stereotypes, pregnancy, child birth, or a related medical condition, sexual orientation. gender identity, and sex characteristics. including intersex traits. H.R 7s redefinition of sex in the FLSA is seriously problematic. We believe that if the bill were to pass, the FLSA could be construed to require employers, including even religious organizations, to a cover and pay for abortions, contraceptives, and gender transition procedures in their health plans b treat same-sex civil marriages as equivalent to traditional marriages in the provision of spousal benefits, and c facilitate abortions and gender transition procedures by providing paid leave for that purpose as part of existing paid leave programs. In this way, the bill would require many religious organizations to be involved in and to approve things they sincerely believe are wrong. Some may argue that Title VII already imposes all or some of these requirements. That argument--in addition to rendering the redefinition of sex in this bill seemingly redundant in whole or in part--overlooks the fact that Title VII has religious exemptions and abortion-neutral language that are not found in the FLSA. The Supreme Court has put off to another day the resolution of the question of exactly how the sex discrimination provisions of Title VII intersect with the religious convictions of employers. Bostock v. Clayton County. 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1753-54 2020. H.R 7 would raise a similar question but in a different statutory setting, one in which the critical religious exemptions and abortion-neutral language of Title VII are entirely missing. For these reasons, we urge members to oppose the redefinition of sex in H.R 7 and instead revert to the version of the bill that passed the House in the 116th Congress. Sincerely. His Eminence Timothy Cardinal Dolan, Archbishop of New York, Chairman, Committee for Religious Liberty. Most Reverend Paul S. Coakley, Archbishop of Oklahoma City, Chairman, Committee on Domestic Justice And Human Development. Most Reverend Joseph F. Naumann, Archbishop of Kansas City in Kansas, Chairman, Committee on Pro-Life Activities. Most Rev. David A. Konderla, Bishop of Tulsa, Chairman, Subcommittee for the Promotion, and Defense of Marriage. ____ National Right to Life Committee, Inc., Alexandria, VA, April 13, 2021. Re In Opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7. Dear Representative This week, the House will consider the Paycheck Fairness Act H.R 7. While the legislation is meant to address potential discrimination regarding the gender pay gap, the legislation was amended to contain language that could be construed to require employers to cover elective abortion in their healthcare benefits. Because of this change, National Right to Life urges you to oppose the bill and reserves the right to include a House roll call on this measure in our scorecard of key pro-life votes of the 117th Congress. H.R 7 states that it constitutes discrimination to provide disparate wages based on sex, and the legislation creates more opportunities to seek remedies for those challenging compensation. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC has defined equal pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to include all forms of compensation, including healthcare benefits. H.R 7 makes definitional changes to sex to include pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition. It is well established that abortion will be regarded as a related medical condition. See 29 C.F.R pt. 1604 App. 1986 and Doe v. CARS Protection Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358 3d Cir. 2008. Historically, when Congress has addressed discrimination based on sex, rules of construction have been added to prevent requiring funding of abortion. Since there is no rule of construction that would make this legislation abortion- neutral, it is likely that H.R 7 could be used to sue employers for a lack of elective abortion coverage. Under H.R 7, a person could make a claim that an employers failure to provide health coverage for abortion is discriminatory if an employer provides health coverage for male-specific items. For the reasons above, National Right to Life opposes the current version of H.R 7 and reserves the right to include a House roll call on this measure in our scorecard of key pro- life votes of the 117th Congress. Should you have any questions, please contact us. Thank you for your consideration of NRLCs position on this matter. Respectfully submitted, Carol Tobias, President. David N. OSteen, Ph.D , Executive Director. Jennifer Popik, J.D , Legislative Director. ____ Susan B. Anthony List, April 13, 2021. Dear Representative I write to advise you that Susan B. Anthony List, on behalf of our more than 900,000 members, opposes H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which was amended at the last minute to add a definition of sex that could force employers to cover elective abortion through employee benefits under the guise of fairness. H.R 7 amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 by adding pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition to the definition of sex, which courts have interpreted broadly to include abortion. The abortion implications are buried in layers of court interpretations and regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC. The Fair Labor Standards Act FSLA prohibits sex discrimination in the area of employee wages. And while the FSLA does not explicitly include benefits like health coverage in its definition of wages, the EEOC has interpreted wages to include benefits. The EEOC states that the Equal Pay Act, part of the FSLA, requires that men and women in the same workplace be given equal pay for equal work. The Department of Labor and the EEOC further stipulate that equal pay includes benefits, and the EEOC allows a person to go straight to court with claims this provision has been violated. There is nothing preventing a person from claiming sex discrimination if an employer provides health coverage for all of mens health services but does not pay for coverage for abortion services for women. When the terms pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition were used in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act four decades ago, the terms were accompanied by language stating that employers could not be forced to cover abortion in health insurance benefits except to save the life of the mother. While H.R 7 does not override that limited safeguard, it does fail to extend equivalent safeguards to address its much broader, more sweeping reach. Without abortion neutral language in H.R 7, this legislation opens the door for employers to be sued for sex discrimination by simply refraining from funding abortion on demand in employee health plans. Susan B. Anthony List opposes and will score against H.R 7. Sincerely, Marjorie Dannenfelser, President. Page H1819 ____ March for Life Action, Washington, DC, April 14, 2021. House of Representatives, Washington DC. Dear Representative On behalf of March for Life Action and the millions of pro-life Americans who march to end abortion, I am writing to voice our opposition to H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. While March for Life Action has no position on the original bill, inexplicably the bill language was changed this Congress to include troubling language that seems to have the singular purpose of promoting abortion. The definition included in Section 2 includes pregnancy or related medical condition, which amends the Equal Pay Act portion of the Fair Labor Standards Act. This law states that it constitutes discrimination to provide different wages to individuals based on sex. The EEOC defines equal pay under the FLSAEqual Pay Act to mean all forms of compensation, including benefits. By stating that sex includes pregnancy or related medical condition, the bill establishes the expectation that women will be given equal benefits related to pregnancy and abortion. The legislation gives power to the Federal government to use its full force to attack health care providers, including businesses, which do not include full abortion coverage in their plans, and be subject to the enhanced penalties laid out in the bill. Clearly this legislation is not about fairness, however it is pushing a radical abortion scheme that is opposed by most Americans. For these reasons, March for Life Action will score against H.R 7 in our annual scorecard for the 117th Congress. Sincerely, Thomas McClusky, President, March for Life Action. ____ Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the passage of H.R 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. This landmark legislation, of which I am a proud cosponsor, will close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act to better protect and promote effective remedies for workers still subject to inequitable and insufficient pay. Signed into law by President John F. Kennedy in 1963, the Equal Pay Act was the first anti-discrimination law addressing wage differences at the federal level. Now, half a century after its enactment, women and minorities still face significant wage disparities despite making great strides in the workforce. According to a study conducted by the U.S Census Bureaus American Community Survey, the median earnings for women in Texas is 36k, compared to the median earnings of 46k for men. Across the Nation, women are only earning on average 82 cents for every dollar a man makes in similar, full-time positions. The differences are only exacerbated when you take into consideration that Black women make 63 cents, Native American women 60 cents, and Hispanic women 55 cents. As the first Black woman elected in Dallas and someone who has worked in fields dominated by men, I have witnessed and experienced firsthand the biases and hardships that women and minorities face in our workforce. That is why I am proud to announce that the advances made in this legislation are wide-ranging and significant. The Paycheck Fairness Act will protect working women against retaliation for discussing salaries, prohibit employers from screening job applicants based on their salary history, and finally require employers to prove that pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons. Additionally, this effort will make improvements to the tools available to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor to enforce the Equal Pay Act. Madam Speaker, as a member of the Democratic Womens Caucus, I am committed to advancing the professional development and financial security of women and minorities in our workforce. That is why I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support of the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill Im proud to have voted for in the previous Congress. Today, women make up the majority of the college-educated workforce, yet only earn approximately 82 percent of what men earn. For women of color, the pay gap is even worse. This legislation is critical because it makes significant progress in eliminating pay discrimination against women by providing them the necessary protections and tools to combat sex-based pay discrimination. Simply put, ensuring that one half of the workforce is paid as much for the same job as the other half is a matter of basic rights and fairness. Women deserve better, and I look forward to voting for this bill once again. time 1400 The SPEAKER pro tempore Ms. DelBene. All time for debate has expired.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman from Virginia Mr. Scott and the gentlewoman from North Carolina Ms. Foxx each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Madam Speaker, these amendments will require the EEOC to provide for the collection of annual compensation data for employees disaggregated by race, sex, and national origin add a requirement that employers post notices and distribute information electronically informing employees of their rights under this act direct the Department of Labor establish a program to award grants to employers to engage in training and conduct self-audits to identify and reduce bias in pay practices direct the Secretary of Labor to conduct a study and a research literature review of gender wage gap in the teenage workforce and reestablish the National Equal Pay Equity Task Force that had been set up under the Obama administration to coordinate efforts between the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Personnel Management. These amendments will make meaningful improvements to the bill, and I urge a yes vote on the en bloc amendments. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in opposition to the en bloc amendments. Madam Speaker, in America, discriminating in pay based on sex is illegal, as codified in the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act. Democrats claim H.R 7 will improve upon these bipartisan laws to create new opportunities for women to fight pay discrimination. What H.R 7 actually does is create new opportunities for trial lawyers to earn higher paychecks while offering no new protections for pay discrimination in the workplace. Unfortunately, I cannot support any of the Democrat amendments to H.R 7 because none of them addresses the numerous unworkable and onerous provisions in the bill. I appreciate that Representative Beyers amendment recognizes the very serious problems with H.R 7 by attempting to place a fig leaf on the expansive government data collection mandate in the bill. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, is still required to implement the draconian data collection scheme in the underlying bill, which is still extremely misguided, expensive, and unnecessary. H.R 7 requires business owners to submit reams of pay data to the EEOC disaggregated by job category, race, sex, and ethnicity. Moreover, the collection mandate also includes other employment-related data, including hiring, termination, and promotion data, which even the discredited 2016 Obama administration pay data collection scheme did not include. The data collection mandate in H.R 7 raises several concerns. First, it puts at risk volumes of highly confidential pay data involving millions of individual workers. We all know of the widespread data breaches the Federal Government has suffered. Second, EEOC will not be able to manage or properly use this data. It has never been explained what exactly the EEOC will do with this data. Madam Speaker, data is not the same as information. Third, this mandate is overly burdensome. Under the Obama administration scheme, the data cells required from business owners when they file an Employer Information Report, EEO-1, with EEOC expanded 180 cells to 3,660. Let me say that again from 180 cells to 3,660. H.R 7s scheme will add on hundreds, if not thousands, of more data cells. EEOC has estimated that with the new reams of pay data added, the collection will cost business owners more than 600 million annually. I doubt that is going to help one single woman in this country. Although this amendment purports to give EEOC more discretion to implement the pay data collection, this data collection mandate should simply be removed from the bill. In any event, discretion cuts both ways, and the Democrat-controlled EEOC may choose to implement a data collection scheme even more expansive. Let me be clear that the Beyer amendment does not improve the draconian pay data collection mandate in Page H1821 the underlying bill or the other serious flaws in other sections of H.R 7 we have talked about today. Representative Newmans amendment takes a longstanding reasonable requirement and makes it disruptive and unworkable. First, the amendment requires a workplace notice posting of a partisan special-interest bill which fails to address pay discrimination in the workplace. Second, under current law, covered employers must post a notice of the equal employment opportunity rights in a conspicuous place at the workplace. Employees who telecommute or otherwise do not have access to the physical notice must be provided an electronic version. Under Representative Newmans amendment, the employer must post electronic copies of a new notice on an internal website to which employees have access. This is unrealistic. H.R 7 applies to millions of small businesses that do not have websites, much less internal websites for their employees. In keep with the other impractical provisions in H.R 7, the amendment adds another onerous requirement on small businesses that will be stuck with the bill. Representative Ocasio-Cortez amendment would create a new program for the Department of Labor to--I hate to say this word--train employers regarding bias in negotiation and other wage-setting practices. The amendment includes a non-exhaustive list of 13 wage- setting practices on which employers allegedly need education. Employers may understandably review this list as 13 new ways for trial lawyers to allege violations of the Equal Pay Act. I will compliment one aspect of Representative Ocasio-Cortez amendment. It mentions compensation self-audits. Republicans agree that self-audits can be a useful tool in combating pay discrimination, and we urge support for the Republican substitute amendment which encourages employers to conduct self-evaluations to identify potentially unlawful pay differences and to take steps to rectify any unlawful pay practices. Unfortunately, H.R 7 does not encourage these self-evaluations. Representative Williams amendment reestablishes the Obama-era National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force. This amendment would establish another politically biased government bureaucracy that includes agencies such as the EEOC and the Department of Labor already tasked with enforcing laws against pay discrimination and ensuring compliance with those laws. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia Mr. Beyer. Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support my amendment to H.R 7. I was privileged to serve on the Science Committee and study physics as an undergraduate, and I have always been impressed with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It says you cant measure something without changing it. As a longtime businessman, we always wanted to be driven by data because you cant manage what you dont measure. Receiving equal pay should not have to depend on an anonymous note writer letting you know that you are being underpaid. Guaranteeing that women and men receive equal pay for equal work is a principle rooted in our Nations commitment to equality and fairness. My amendment would require employers to report pay data by race, national origin, and gender to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and for that data to be shared with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. It would lengthen the timeframe for inception of the pay data collection from 18 to 24 months, providing the EEOC with more time to develop and execute an effective pay data collection. I believe it is plausible, Madam Speaker, to say that more than 90 percent of paychecks are prepared by software, either internal or external. I remember preparing paychecks by hand, but it is a very small business that does that anymore. That software will evolve overnight, probably through the course of this debate, and the burden is likely to be small. The amendment also permits, but doesnt require, the use of pay bands or hours-worked data and provides the EEOC with flexibility in what type of compensation data to use. Importantly, it also gives the EEOC the discretion to collect additional employment-related data but also to consider employer burden, data format, and confidentiality. Pay data reporting by employers promises to shine light on race and gender pay disparities, increase the likelihood of employer self- analysis and self-correction, and identify the areas of concern for further investigation by enforcement agencies. Reporting this data will also allow the EEOC to see which employers have racial or gender pay gaps that differ significantly from the pay patterns from other employers in their industry and region. I can also say, after almost 50 years of adapting to Federal regulations, almost every business can find a way to profit from it. Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I have two additional speakers. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois Ms. Newman. Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Ms. Foxx for her comments, and I will share a tip because I am a former small business owner. So, there is this great thing called communication. You can chat with one another and talk about some of their rights, so I recommend it for all that ask. Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the millions of women in the workforce that to this day are still only making 82 cents on every dollar. My amazing colleagues have identified lots of stats that are very, very convincing with strong data. I ask today that everyone consider the 15 to 20 percent of the female workforce who have either paused or stopped their careers--or ruined their careers, which many would say--because of the pandemic. It has been devastating, as we all know. The Paycheck Fairness Act builds on the Equal Pay Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act by making it harder for employers to pay women less than men for the same work. When woman return to the workforce, and I pray that they do, we must ensure that they are aware of their rights under legislation--verbally, electronically, by any means it all works--which is why I have introduced an amendment that requires employers to display a poster in their workplace or their employment worksite, or by email, or whatever they can do, so workers clearly understand that they have rights under this act. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment and this legislation so we can ensure equal work means equal pay. Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. time 1415 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Georgia Ms. Williams. Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act and my amendment to this bill. On average, full-time working women need to work well into the next year to catch up to the salary our male counterparts earned the previous year. March 24 marked the day that womens salaries, on average, caught up to the salaries of our male counterparts in 2020. For several subgroups of women, this date wont come until later this year. For example, as a Black woman, it will take until August--an additional 8 months--to make the same salary of our male counterparts as they did in 2020. The American people look to Congress to be a force for economic justice and create policies that are fair and just. It is simply wrong that in the 21st century women still face pay inequity. That is why I am proud to support the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will strengthen existing laws to ensure that women are getting the pay that they deserve. Page H1822 My amendment will build on this crucial legislation by reestablishing the Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force. This task force, which previously existed during the Obama-Biden administration, will ensure Federal agencies are working together to limit any potential gaps in enforcement of equal pay laws. Putting this task force back in place will bring us one step closer to ensuring that women finally receive equal pay for equal work. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the bill before us today to ensure that women are paid fairly. Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I hope we would adopt these three good amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I support equal pay for equal work. I dont know how many times Republicans have to say that, but we will keep saying it if necessary because equal pay for equal work is the right thing to do, but it is also required under two Federal statutes, and in most cases it is being adhered to. Congress should focus on policies that will continue to increase economic opportunity and expand options for all workers. That is what we should be doing in the Education and Labor Committee looking for ways to increase economic opportunity and expand options for all workers. We shouldnt be doing away with pipeline jobs, we shouldnt be raising taxes, and we shouldnt be decreasing options for people to work in this country but that is what this administration is doing, and that is what the other side is doing. The Democrat amendments and the underlying bill fail miserably in terms of increasing options and expanding economic opportunity. It is pushing people into the bands, making everybody the same and treating everybody as though they have no individuality, they shouldnt be innovative, they shouldnt be creative, and they shouldnt strive for more. That is not the way to go. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Democrat en bloc amendment and the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Virginia. The question is on the amendments en bloc. The question was taken and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3s of House Resolution8, the yeas and nays are ordered. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question are postponed. Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mrs. Miller-Meeks The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part B of House Report 117-15. Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I rise as the designee of Representative Stefanik, and I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows Strike all of the bill and insert the following SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be referred to as the Wage Equity Act of 2021. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 1 In 1963, Congress passed on a bipartisan basis the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to prohibit discrimination on account of sex in the payment of wages for equal work performed by employees for employers engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce. 2 Following the passage of such Act, in 1964, Congress passed on a bipartisan basis the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Since the passage of both the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, women have made significant strides, both in the workforce and in their educational pursuits. 3 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were over 77,000,000 women in the workforce, the most in American history. Of the 2,000,000 jobs created in 2019, 53 percent went to women. This follows a trend that has been rising for some time. Women are graduating from college at a higher rate than their male counter parts, making up 61 percent of all college degrees conferred in 2018. Additionally, according to a recent survey of working women, more than half are their familys primary breadwinner. 4 The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on working women, resulting in over 2 million women leaving the workforce since February 2020. 5 Despite these advances there is still concern among the American public that gender-based wage discrimination has not been eliminated.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman from Iowa Mrs. Miller-Meeks and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Iowa. Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, equal work deserves equal pay, and we owe it to women to constructively engage on addressing pay disparities in the workplace and put forward real solutions. Unfortunately, Democrats have put forth a bill that prioritizes lawsuits and government regulation over womens economic empowerment and advancement. H.R 7 would require employers to make intrusive data disclosures that would add compliance costs exceeding 600 million per year while posing serious threats to workers privacy and their paychecks. On top of these onerous new requirements, H.R 7 will force Americas businesses to prepare for an onslaught of frivolous lawsuits, which now will be open to unlimited compensatory and limited damages. Forty percent of small businesses are run by women, and H.R 7 would make it harder for these women business owners to succeed. This issue is too important to leave to partisan solutions. Our amendment, the Wage Equity Act, offers a stark contrast to the approach laid out in H.R 7. We look to innovation in the States to find bipartisan policy that is supported by both Republicans and Democrats and signed by Republican Governors--proof that equal pay for equal work is not a partisan issue. The Wage Equity Act supports the empowerment of women in todays economy. Americas businesses--particularly our small businesses--seek to do right by their employees. In recognition of this, the Wage Equity Act creates a voluntary pay analysis system to encourage the good-faith efforts of employers to self-identify and correct any wage disparities, should they exist, creating an environment of consistent self- reflection. We believe every American should be able to negotiate employment based upon their qualifications and merit for the position, and that a victim of wage discrimination should not have this discrimination follow them to their next job and compound through the rest of their career. This is why this amendment protects the employees right to not disclose their salary history during the job interview process unless they wish to do so voluntarily. At the same time, we cannot erode the necessary negotiations that take place in a job interview. The Wage Equity Act protects the ability for an employee and their prospective employer to have a pay expectation conversation, an important part of any negotiation. Our amendment protects employees ability to discuss compensation with Page H1824 their colleagues while giving employers the ability to set reasonable limitations on the time, location, and manner of this activity to protect employees from harassment. Furthermore, the Wage Equity Act seeks to put women on equal footing as men as they start their careers with a grant program targeted towards women in college and career tech programs to provide negotiation skills education. Lastly, our amendment directs the GAO to study the managers gap to give us a clearer sense of the impact new parents leaving the workforce have on an employees future earning and opportunity potential. These are commonsense proposals that are supported by both Democrats and Republicans alike. I encourage my colleagues to reject partisan Government overreach and to support practical, bipartisan solutions that improve the existing law of the land--equal pay for equal work--by voting for the Stefanik amendment. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut Mrs. Hayes. Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, this amendment would allow employers to self-audit compensation disparity. Asking the same employer, who may be engaged in pay discrimination, to self-police their wage practices is a blatant conflict of interest. Rather than actually incentivizing equal pay, as Ms. Stefanik would claim, this amendment gives employers the tool to hide evidence of pay discrimination and delay any resulting lawsuit and accountability by 3 years. The very idea behind this provision is insidious. It presumes that employers should be given loopholes to avoid liability after breaking the law. Employers do not need a workaround to guard against these types of lawsuits. Their best defense is simple do not engage in wage discrimination. In fact, this amendment actually creates another means for employers to discriminate on the basis of sex by preserving a vague standard for employer defense when accused of wage discrimination. Unlike Ms. Stefaniks proposed amendment, H.R 7 makes clear that the any factor other than sex employer defense must be bona fide, job-related, and required by business necessity. Employees must be judged by their education, training or experience instead of their gender. As women drop out of the workforce in historic numbers due to the pressures of COVID-19, we have a responsibility to take every precaution to ensure they do not face discrimination when they return to the workforce. The Paycheck Fairness Act ensures all workers will get equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender. It will prohibit employers from paying women less simply because another employer paid them less in the past. It helps to oppose pay discrimination with more speed and transparency, and allows women to fight pay injustices they may experience. The Paycheck Fairness Act fixes a systemic injustice that women have suffered. This amendment would only water down this landmark civil rights and labor legislation. Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote no to this amendment and stand up for equity. Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from North Carolina Ms. Foxx. Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment, which was also introduced earlier this week by Representative Stefanik as a standalone bill, H.R 2491, the Wage Equity Act of 2021. Unlike the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act, which will unfairly punish businessowners and reward trial lawyers at the expense of workers, this amendment will effectively address pay discrimination in the workplace and help working women by ensuring pay differences among workers of the opposite sex are due to legitimate business-related reasons. Among other commonsense provisions, this amendment will direct funds and research towards womens advancement in the workplace and will also authorize a grant program to educate women in college careers and technical programs on negotiating pay. This amendment will also allow job applicants to disclose prior salary history voluntarily, ensuring they control this information as they see fit. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut Ms. DeLauro, who is the sponsor of the underlying legislation. Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, the gender pay gap is a pervasive problem that demands thoughtful, multipronged solutions. The Paycheck Fairness Act represents a comprehensive response to the shortcomings of existing law and addresses the holes that have emerged over time. Representative Stefaniks substitute, the Wage Equity Act, is exactly what the Paycheck Fairness Act has been fighting over the years. It purports to offer protections, but, in reality, it creates loopholes that give a wink and a nod to discrimination. Not only would it offer empty protections, it would erode existing protections already in place. The substitute includes inadequate protections for workers who discuss or disclose wages. While ostensibly protecting employees who disclose or discuss that pay, it allows employers to place limitations on when, where, and how employees may do so, negating the point of the provision. Madam Speaker, you cannot remedy pay discrimination if you have no idea that you are making less than the man across the hall. When workers fear retaliation for talking about their pay, any wage gap they face is likely to continue to grow undiscovered in the shadows. More egregiously, there is no mechanism for enforcement, as it would allow employers who conduct self-designed pay audits to escape accountability for unlawful pay disparities and deny a worker a remedy. I think it bears repeating that corporations do not feel free to sell us spoiled meat, lock our daughters up in ninth-floor sweatshops with no fire escapes, employ our underage sons in coal mines, force us to work 13-hour shifts without overtime or a break because corporations experienced a moment of Zen and decided to evolve. No. They were forced into greater accountability and social concern by the legitimate actions of a democratic government. In other words, if we depend on goodwill or a self-audit, then we are all screwed. This amendment seeks to destroy the entire purpose of the bill and allows companies to evade accountability for violating the law. Madam Speaker, I urge a no vote on this amendment and a yes vote for the Paycheck Fairness Act. Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. time 1430 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I would hope we would defeat the amendment. This just recreates the loopholes that we are trying to close. You have to start with the idea that there is a differential in pay. And what we are trying to do is-- if you can explain this in any kind of way that is business-related, then they get away with it. The Fair Pay Act says it has to be bona fide and required by the job. If it is not required by the job, why do you have a differential in pay? We can do better than this, and I hope we defeat the amendment. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Iowa Mrs. Miller-Meeks. The question was taken and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appear to have it. Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. Page H1825 The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Even a sovereign state, the Seneca Nation of Indians6, received a 1.5 million loan under the federal Paycheck Protection Program. Nonprofits with religious affiliations received the most number of loans, 406. Thats more than one-third of the 1,080 loans extended to nonprofits. But in terms of loan dollars distributed, no one received more than nonprofit health care providers, including medical practices 33.3 million, hospitals 30 million and nursing homes 19.1 million. By contrast, schools, churches and social services with a religious affiliation received 20.3 million. Who got what Search our database of WNY recipientsNonprofit leaders, much like business operators, told Investigative Post the federal aid was critical. Ray Ganoe, CEO at Evergreen Health Services7, told Investigative Post that he at first feared the organization, which offers health care services to underserved people, was too large to qualify as a small business. Ganoe said he was glad to make the cut the loan saved the operation. This was a lifeline for us, he said. The loan helped the regions largest arts and education center, as well. The Chautauqua Institution8s summer season and live performances, its lifeblood, were canceled due to the pandemic.Michael Hill, the institutions president, said the years revenue cratered without the expected 100,000 visitors.

The Erie County Agricultural Society33, which manages the annual Erie County Fair, received 600,000. Mike Bolas, the organizations chief financial officer, said the money was initially used to plan the fair this past summer. Nearly all of it was earmarked for payroll and benefits. Public health and financial risks led to the cancelation of the fair34, the organizations single-largest revenue generator at 7 million. It was a gut-wrenching decision, Bolas said. The cancelation triggered furloughs for 30 of the 45 staff members. Seven have returned to work since. Those still on lay-off had their health insurance coverage extended through the end of the year. Like the fair, the Chautauqua Institution is a major economic engine for the surrounding area. Its also one of its countys largest employers. When the institutions summer season was canceled35, projected annual revenues dropped from 34 million to 1.7 million and 1,300 seasonal employees werent hired, said Hill, the organizations president. The 3.3 million PPP loan was instrumental in supporting the remaining 120 employees, Hill said. They built the digital infrastructure that enabled the institution to present virtual events.But the institution still had to spend 80 percent of its reserve funds to survive. We understood the ripple effect that might occur if there were large layoffs at the institution, Hill said.

The organizations serve everyone from homeless veterans and breast cancer survivors to young people who might become the next generation of warriors. Her volunteerism, which focuses on women veterans, has also given Peters an outlet to channel her own difficult experiences into something positive.I just tell my story that I have lived, she said. I speak to people from my heart about what its like to be down on your luck and to struggle. It has given me the opportunity to speak and volunteer at different events that give back and I have also gotten a lot of my other female veteran friends involved, as well. It has given me the opportunity to re-engage with my veteran community eurordquo something that I thought I had lost once I got out of the military. It has also been very therapeutic and forced me to get out of my house and not allow my own struggles to consume me but be a light that guides me.
