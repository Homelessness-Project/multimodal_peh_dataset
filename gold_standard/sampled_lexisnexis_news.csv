Democrats just dont understand the meaning of the Second Amendment and why our founders put it in [STREET].48 Climate Activists Plan to Bring Traffic to a [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION] As [PERSON]4 Climate Action Summit opens in [PERSON], a coalition of activists plans to bring GPE2 streets to a standstill by blocking key intersections around the city. Its important to call attention to the climate emergency, says PERSON4, a spokesperson for the group. The point being to disrupt business as usual for people and policy makers in decision-making positions, and also to essentially shut the city down until the issue gets the type of attention that it deserves based on the gravity of the crisis that were in.

Reports show former ORG[DATE] chairman [PERSON]9 has briefed [ORGANIZATION] officials on a proposal to create an agency called [ORGANIZATION], or ORG21, to design inventive ways to use data for preventing violent incidents. [ORGANIZATION]0 is one of [ORGANIZATION]s long-time friends. Ivanka [ORGANIZATION] asked people pushing for the new agency if it could prevent mass shootings, one person familiar with the conversations who spoke on anonymity because off the sensitive details told ORG22 on [LOCATION]6. Her questions came after the shootings in [LOCATION], GPE9, and [PERSON], GPE11.

It was the most uncomfortable feeling in the world, said the woman, who did not want to be identified.68 [ORGANIZATION] After ORG13 Unveils iPhone [DATE] Right after ORG13 announced the iPhone 11, numerous owners of older [ORGANIZATION] began to report device malfunctions reminiscent of a [LOCATION]7 debacle in which the company admitted slowing the performance of older phones  officially in order to extend their battery life. At the time, ORG13 said in a statement that it had never  and wound never  do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any ORG13 product. According to [PERSON], however, the coincidences are piling up. So, of course Im suspicious that [LOCATION]8 ORG13 announcement killed my current iPhone. It just stopped working.

One could almost hear the gears turning on the GPE16 machine, a hobbled but still functioning apparatus now in the sights of federal investigators. [ORGANIZATION]7 is an accomplished lawyer. She helped start [ORGANIZATION]. These facts should not prevent criticism arising from her [LOCATION]9 marriage to a [ORGANIZATION]0 GPE16 political boss [ORGANIZATION]8 Over One Billion Users Worldwide Vulnerable to Hackers Using [PERSON] Security Flaw73 According to ORG28, the flaw allowing scammers to trick [PERSON] users into exposing their personal details was first detected in [LOCATION]7. The schemers use its setting that automatically adds an event from an email invitation into a persons calendar, even if the message was unwanted. ORG6 is working diligently to eliminate a weakness that could allow perpetrators to steal the sensitive data of [PERSON] users, the company stated in an update to the Help page for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] by [ORGANIZATION]9 via ORG29 blog The viral campaign to storm LOC2 was scheduled for [ORGANIZATION]1, and after [ORGANIZATION]2 of controversy, the organizers decided instead to set up a festival called [ORGANIZATION] in the middle of the desert, where all of the LOC2 enthusiasts could gather in a safe and legal [STREET]. Unfortunately, locals in the small town of [LOCATION], GPE[DATE] were not very happy about the idea of thousands of curiosity seekers descending on their neighborhood. After the festival was announced, a warning was posted on the towns website in response to the news, stating that local residents would defend their property by force if they had to, saying that the situation could get ugly.76 Red Flag Gun Laws Are Rooted in Communist Methods of Oppression77 [ORGANIZATION]3 government officials came back from their [ORGANIZATION]4 recess, and I have heard from a couple different sources that the GPE6 [PERSON]1 in particular is seeking to fast track legislation on Red Flag gun laws as well as a possible ban on private party transfers of firearms and a possible ban on high capacity magazines. I can only hope that these are just rumors, but I suspect they are accurate. [PERSON]1 Majority Leader PERSON30 has publicly vowed to pursue any new gun control legislation that the [ORGANIZATION] Administration supports, and Donald [ORGANIZATION] has openly called for Red Flag gun laws involving mental health guidelines. The mainstream media now claims that a majority of [ORGANIZATION]s on both sides of the political divide support red flag legislation, but we all know how rigged such polls can be. The real question is, does the average [ORGANIZATION] even know what red flag laws would entail? I think they do not.78 PERSON31 Says [ORGANIZATION] is at All-Time High79 [PERSON]s ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, PERSON31, said [LOCATION]2 that hostility toward Christians in the world has reached an all-time high. There is more persecution of Christians now, arguably than any time in the history of the world, and the Christian faith is the most persecuted faith in the world, by far, PERSON32 said in his keynote address at the sixth [ORGANIZATION] Solidarity Dinner hosted by [PERSON]3 in GPE19, DC.80 [ORGANIZATION] Member Proposes New Plan for Homeless Problem  Bus Homeless People Out of the City81 GPE21 has a massive homeless problem, perhaps only second to [LOCATION], GPE23.

Bus them to other cities!82 PERSON33 [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], And [PERSON] Edward PERSON33 has finally laid it all out  documenting his memoires in a new 432-page book, Permanent Record, which will be published worldwide on [ORGANIZATION]5 Teen Activist Being Exploited by Left Says GPE24 Has Moral Responsibility on Climate Change85 As annoying as teen climate activist PERSON35 may be, we must remember that she is a child who is being exploited by adults for political purposes. To make matters worse, she has some serious mental health issues. She is autistic, has obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suffers from [ORGANIZATION] syndrome. She is currently in GPE25 on a sort of climate change tour, and to speak at [PERSON]4. She is also participating in protests. During a demonstration at FAC0 on [ORGANIZATION]6, [PERSON] said the GPE24 has a moral responsibility to act on climate change. [PERSON], her handlers dont seem interested in bringing this message to [LOCATION] or GPE27. Comment Go back to school Greta.86 [PERSON]5 by PERSON37 Even perfunctory analyses of the [STREET] corporations operate and how they affect society show that corporations should be banned for the same reason slavery was banned. Actually, corporations have become nothing but a modern, more efficient form of slavery. Though, as the result of some legal chicanery, for some purposes they are considered people, corporations have no soul. Moreover, they have no ethics, principles or morals. Despite claims on the contrary they usually make in their institutional advertising, the only purpose of a corporation is to maximize the profits of its shareholders  at any cost. A film based on PERSON38 book [ORGANIZATION], shows that most corporations exhibit many of the traits of psychopathic behavior, such as Callous unconcern for the feelings of others Incapacity to maintain enduring relationships Reckless disregard for the safety of others [LOCATION] repeated lying and conning of others for profit Incapacity to experience guilt Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior.Corporations have created a particular sort of mirage. You look around and are tricked to believe that you see hospitals, colleges, department stores, hardware stores, drug factories, airlines, etc., but that is part of the illusion. Ultimately, corporations do not care about the products they make  be it cars, drugs, electronic gadgets, food, books, gas, or airplanes , much less about their workers or the customers who buy their products. Their only goal is to persuade you to buy their products, disregarding whether or not their products are safe, negatively affect your health or create an addiction. To reach their goals they resort to any type of mind manipulation through advertising that includes falsehood, fabrications, deception, and outright lies, in order to maximize their profits. Proof that corporations do not care less about their customers is the fact that, to maximize profits, they have outsourced most of the manufacture of their products. But, having solved a short-term problem, they have created a long-term one they have destroyed the [STREET] of living of their own consumers. The direct result of moving production overseas to GPE28, [LOCATION], and other countries to profit from quasi-slave labor, is that they have deprived most of their working-class customers of their source of income. Currently, 9 out of every 10 products sold by the [PERSON]6 corporation are made in [LOCATION], and 9 out of every 10 [PERSON]6 customers is a worker who lost his well-paid job because, to maximize its profits, [PERSON]6 does not buy [ORGANIZATION]-made products. But that is not the only problem corporations pose. Once they become economically powerful they aim for political power as well. Their ultimate goal is to take control of the state, a political system PERSON39 called lo stato corporativo  the corporate state another name for [PERSON]7. Like most things wrong on this planet, the modern corporation is a PERSON40 baby  initially they called it a trust. No wonder critics called the PERSON40s one of the families that have done more damage to the people of the world.

So, if there is no evidence to prove that [PERSON] has the most mass shootings in the world, why would the media and Democrats accept the flawed study without looking into it a little deeper? Could a push for gun control, regardless of the truth be the answer? But the claim is based on just one study, and the author of that study, PERSON43, would not release his data to either PERSON44 or researchers in the field. Economist [PERSON] says that PERSON46 study has many flaws. Watch, as top economist [PERSON] appears on PERSON44 TV where he reveals the flawed data used by leftist media and politicians like PERSON48 to promote gun control. PERSON[DATE] calls PERSON46 study, academic malpractice. [ORGANIZATION] reports  [PERSON], president of [PERSON]2, crunched the numbers and said his count shows that the GPE24 had less than 3 percent of the worlds mass public shootings over a [ORGANIZATION]7 period. That is smaller than [ORGANIZATION] of the worlds population that the GPE24 accounts for  and [STREET] less than the 31 percent of global mass shooters that PERSON43, a professor at the [PERSON]9, claimed in his widely publicized studies. Comment Another leftist professor pushing lies as truth in order to disarm [ORGANIZATION]s.90 GPE6 Woman Left Semi-Comatose After Using [ORGANIZATION]-Tainted Anti-Aging Cream91 A [ORGANIZATION]8 woman is now bed-bound in a semi-comatose state after slathering her skin with an anti-aging skin care cream that doctors say was contaminated with high amounts of methylmercury, a highly poisonous form of mercury. One family from GPE29, GPE23, is grieving after their mother became ill and lost virtually all motor functions due to a mercury poisoning that experts say is the first of its kind in the GPE6. PERSON50, the GPE23 womans son, told local GPE29 news outlet [PERSON]4 that his mother quickly became sick at [ORGANIZATION]9 and was taken to the hospital for [ORGANIZATION]0 after using a special kind of Ponds Rejuveness Anti-Wrinkle Cream that she had been importing from [PERSON]0, GPE28, through a friend for [ORGANIZATION]1. Though she had been using the cream without any issues for [ORGANIZATION]2, doctors were eventually able to identify this recent batch was tainted with methylmercury, a form of mercury that is toxic to the central and peripheral nervous systems92 [ORGANIZATION] Hosts Anime Writing Course, But Apparently Lacks Funds for ORG81-Required Constitution Course93 [PERSON]6 offers a course in which students can learn about anime writing while it refuses to comply with a state law mandating a Constitution course. For three credits, [ORGANIZATION] students can take Media Writing Advanced Manga and Anime, according to [PERSON]7. At the same time, the school has flouted a state law mandating that students take a course on the Constitution and other founding documents, stating funding concerns.94 [PERSON] [PERSON]8 Elects PERSON51 as New Leader95 [PERSON]1 AP  [PERSON] far-right [PERSON]8 elected former minister and presidential candidate PERSON51 as its leader on [ORGANIZATION]3 as it seeks to return to power in a [ORGANIZATION]4 national election, trying to move beyond the scandal that brought down the previous administration. [PERSON]9 reported that more than 98 of delegates at a party [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]2 backed [PERSON], who ran unopposed. [PERSON] was designated for the job after [PERSON], the ORG50 leader of [ORGANIZATION]5, resigned in [ORGANIZATION]6 following the publication of a video in which he appeared to offer favors to a purported Russian investor.96 [PERSON]3 Police Face Protesters in [PERSON]4 as Yellow Vest Marches Resume97 [PERSON]5, [PERSON]3 Reuters  Hundreds of demonstrators faced police in a tense stand-off in the French city of [PERSON]4 on [ORGANIZATION]3 as revived yellow vest protests against the government of President [PERSON] took [STREET] across the country. Police responded with tear gas after some protesters threw projectiles. A spokesman with the local prefecture said 21 people had been arrested.98 [PERSON]6 Govt Team Completed With Undersecretaries99 ORG51 has 6 deputy ministers to ORG55s four, PERSON55 says important ORG52  [PERSON]7, [ORGANIZATION]7  The government on [ORGANIZATION]6 named [DATE] undersecretaries ending [ORGANIZATION]8 of sometimes heated discussions, completing the government team. Senior government partner the anti-establishment [ORGANIZATION] ORG51 gets 21 undersecretaries while junior partner the centre-left [LOCATION] ORG55 gets [DATE], government sources said. The other government components, the tiny leftwing ORG56 party and the Italians abroad group ORG57 get two and one respectively. The ORG51 will also have an advantage in terms of deputy ministers with six compared to the ORG55s four. Only 14 of the [DATE] are women. Government sources voiced satisfaction that an agreement had been found on the undersecretaries. Both the ORG51 and the ORG55 said they were satisfied with the number of officials they had obtained. Now were ready to give our utmost, said ORG51 leader and Foreign Minister PERSON56. The government team is complete, ready to give its all for the country!, he said. On [ORGANIZATION]9 the new team will be sworn in which will be composed of 21 exponents of the [ORGANIZATION], and six of these will be deputy ministers. For us that means a lot of work to do and greater responsibility. We are ready! Premier [PERSON] PERSON55 said the acceleration on the government team is important because the country is awaiting responses. This team is sufficiently young and amalgamated, said the premier who confirmed the new team will be sworn on [ORGANIZATION]9. Its a great team, built to last, said ORG60 Minister PERSON58. But anti-migrant [ORGANIZATION] leader PERSON59 said weve seen a disgraceful divvying up of seats by the ORG51 and the ORG55. Also on [ORGANIZATION]6, ORG61 Minister PERSON60 said [PERSON]6 is a protagonist in [ORGANIZATION] again thanks to the new government. [PERSON]6 has just formed an unprecedented alliance between the anti-establishment [ORGANIZATION] ORG51 and the centre-left and pro-[ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] ORG55, of which PERSON61 was an [ORGANIZATION] for DATE40 before being named economy minister in the new ORG51-ORG55 executive. With this government, PERSON61 said, [PERSON]6 returns to being a protagonist in [ORGANIZATION], resumes the role that it is entitled to as a founder member of the [ORGANIZATION] which has ideas, imposes its vision of the [ORGANIZATION] as a path to improve, change, and make it more capable of facing the challenges of our world. The new government has said, among other things, that it will try to change the Stability and Growth Pact, as President PERSON62 also hoped in helping set up the ORG51-ORG55 coalition. [PERSON] we will present the government programme as illustrated in parliament by Premier [PERSON] PERSON55, PERSON61 went on. The programme includes averting a 23-billion-euro [ORGANIZATION] hike, cutting the tax wedge for low-to-medium earners, free nurseries for low-to-medium income families, and trying to get investments in the green economy excluded from [ORGANIZATION] fiscal parameters. PERSON61 said [ORGANIZATION]6, however, that the DATE41 budget and excluding green investments had different timescales, with the first obviously taking precedence over the second. The reform of monetary union is on a separate plane from the DATE41 budget bill, he said. PERSON61 stressed, however, that the time of clashes with [ORGANIZATION], like those under former interior minister and [ORGANIZATION] leader PERSON59, was over. PERSON63, who pulled the plug on an ORG51-ORG64 government DATE[DATE] hoping for a snap election to capitalise on high poll numbers and never thinking the ORG51 would get together with traditional foe the ORG55, had frequent run-ins over [ORGANIZATION] fiscal constraints. In an interview with ORG65 [DATE], PERSON61 said there will never be wars with [ORGANIZATION] again. He also said the flat tax pledged by the ORG64 would be shelved, the quota 100 pension reform would run its course in DATE43, and a basic income would be improved. PERSON61 also vowed that the [ORGANIZATION] hike would not happen, with an unprecedented crackdown on tax evasion helping to get the 23 billion euros needed to fund its exclusion. The minister also announced that [PERSON]6 will join the pro-climate coalition. In [PERSON]8, he announced that [PERSON]7 was joining the coalition of financial ministers for the fight against climate change. This is a change, since [PERSON]6 had thus far chosen not to take part in the initiative, which is made up of 40 countries. The aim of the coalition is to boost green investments. ORG66 President PERSON64 said that PERSON61 had reiterated [PERSON]6s pro-euro commitment at an informal ORG66 meeting. PERSON61, he said, had outlined the priorities for the near future and the commitment on policies that help preserve the stability of the euro. He said PERSON65 is not new to the group, seeing as how he frequented it already before, in his capacity as chair of the economy committee. [PERSON] was not the day to discuss his presentation in detail. The Italian dossier will return to the fore in the context of the stability bills, together with those of all the other countries, said the Portuguese finance minister.100 [PERSON]9 Gang Rape in GPE40, Police Currently Looking for Two Dark-Skinned Men101 In [TIME] on [DATE] [TIME], police in GPE40 received a call from a woman who claimed to have been raped by two men. The rape is said to have occurred in the residential area GPE41 between two and three am. The victim told police that the sexual assault occurred outdoors and that the two perpetrators were previously unknown to her, PERSON66 reports.102 GPE[DATE] Flashback [PERSON] Promised No Second Referendum, When [ORGANIZATION], They Will be Respected103 Former prime minister [PERSON] has emerged from hidingto say [PERSON] should not rule out making the British people vote on ORG78 again  but in DATE45 he promised the first vote would be final, and that There will not be another renegotiation and another referendum. Speaking ahead of the [ORGANIZATION] referendum, [PERSON] told the British people that whether their country remained in the [ORGANIZATION]an Union or reclaimed full independence was Your decision. Nobody elses.104 GPE[DATE] Former PM [PERSON] Says Second Referendum Cant be Ruled Out105 Former Prime Minister [PERSON] has said that a second ORG78 referendum cannot be ruled out, and opposed PERSON69 decision to suspend [PERSON]. During an interview with ORG70 published on [ORGANIZATION]6, Mr [PERSON] was asked whether he thought there would be a second referendum, and responded I dont think you can rule it out because were stuck.106 GPE[DATE] Historian Absurd [PERSON] Using [PERSON]ary Sovereignty to Deny National Sovereignty107 Historian and broadcaster [PERSON]0 [ORGANIZATION] has slammed ORG71 [PERSON] for the absurd contradiction of asserting parliamentary sovereignty in order to deny national sovereignty. The idea, which is being pursued hotly by the legion of ORG71ers headed by [PERSON]1, is that parliamentary sovereignty can be used to deny national sovereignty, the Monarchy presenter said in an interview with [PERSON]2 GPE[DATE] [PERSON]3 to Stay in Prison Over Absconding Fears109 ORG72 co-founder [PERSON]3 is to remain in prison when his jail term ends because of his history of absconding, a judge has ruled. He was due to be released on DATE46 after serving his sentence for breaching bail conditions. But ORG73 heard there were substantial grounds for believing he would abscond again.110 GPE[DATE] ORG74 [ORGANIZATION] Switching to ORG75, Not Tories ERG Urge [PERSON]4 to Agree Election Pact111 A new study shows Leave-voting ORG74 voters are considering switching their support to [PERSON]5 ORG75, and not PERSON69 ORG76  lending weight to calls for the Tory leader do an election deal with [PERSON]6 to secure Britains exit from the [ORGANIZATION]an Union.112 GPE[DATE] ORG71 Media Quiet as [STREET] Rules No Deal ORG78 Does Not Breach Irish Peace Deal113 The High [STREET] of GPE43 has ruled that a no-deal ORG78 would not breach the Good [ORGANIZATION]6 Agreement, which supports the peace process in the British province. GPE43, known colloquially as GPE44, was for DATE47 wracked with violence perpetrated by terrorists claiming to be fighting on behalf of the minority of the population which supports leaving GPE45 and uniting with GPE46, and to a lesser extent by loyalist paramilitaries.114 GPE[DATE] [PERSON]7 Sits Down With [PERSON]8 What Happened in Prison, Whats Next115 On DATE48 episode of The [PERSON]8 Show, we filmed an exclusive interview with [PERSON]7 after his release from GPE47 prison in the GPE[DATE]. [PERSON]7 is a journalist whether the media likes it or not. In this interview, questions and answers range from [PERSON]9 conversations with fellow prisoner [PERSON]3, his treatment during his DATE49 stay, his thoughts on ORG78 and what hes working on next.116 GPE48 Oil and Gas Production Reduced by Drone Strikes117 GPE48 has cut oil and gas production following drone attacks on two major oil facilities run by state-owned company ORG79. ORG80 Minister [PERSON] said the strikes had reduced crude oil production by 5.7m barrels a day  about half the kingdoms output. A Yemeni Houthi rebel spokesman said it had deployed 10 drones in the attacks. GPE6 Secretary of ORG81 PERSON81 blamed the attacks on GPE49 saying there was no evidence they came from Yemen.1[DATE] PERSON82 [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION] ORG82 The [ORGANIZATION] administration has claimed the death of [ORGANIZATION], a son of late ORG84 leader PERSON84. According to FAC0 statement, he was killed in an operation in the [PERSON]0-Pakistan region. The loss of [ORGANIZATION] not only deprives ORG86 of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father, but undermines important operational activities of the group, the statement continues.120 [PERSON]6 Migrants Drift to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] migrants from Muslim-majortity [PERSON]1 and [PERSON]2 often end up in leftist-controlled areas due to higher benefits, according to a report. The report, which comes from [ORGANIZATION], states that most [PERSON]1n migrants, who form the largest group of underage migrants who came into [PERSON]6 DATE50, end up in the leftist regions of [PERSON]3 or [PERSON]4, ORG88 reports.122 [PERSON]6 [ORGANIZATION] Ship Allowed to [PERSON] Migrants123 [PERSON]6 has granted permission for the rescue ship [ORGANIZATION] to disembark 82 migrants in the southern island of [PERSON], the ORG89 charity  which runs the vessel  said [ORGANIZATION]3.

Quantitative experiments must have been conducted or psychological questionnaires taken. At worst, some professor of sociology or gender studies must have written a paper categorizing them. But no. Most of these new genders have literally come from microblogging site ORG96.

This is more or less right in the same [STREET] that GPE2 will get far more rain over the course of DATE5 than the rain that caused the recent flooding.

There is no sense in [ORGANIZATION]s remarks that [PERSON] is a militarized, rightwing country that adores [PERSON] and that is led by a strongman and that answers resistance to the existing order with overwhelming force that international human rights organizations said at the time of his remarks were likely war crimes.

PERSON15 fundraising ability  and the fact that he rarely if ever holds fundraisers to collect cash  is a major advantage for his campaign as we move forward into [PERSON] and into [ORGANIZATION] when voters start voting.

Liberal PERSON10emocrats agree! Personally, I think PERSON28 planted the clips in the ORG16 video library. PERSON29 Corporate executives must face jail time for overseeing massive scams ORG17. we should enact [ORGANIZATION], which I introduced DATE17. That bill would make it easier to hold executives at big banks accountable for scams by requiring them to certify that they conducted a due diligence inquiry and found that no illegal conduct was occurring on their watch. This would force executives to look for wrongdoing or face prosecution for filing false certifications with the government. The proposal would also create a permanent and well-funded unit dedicated to investigating financial crimes.  Thats the stuff to give the troops!

The latest delivery halt was prompted after the service opened up some closed compartments, such as inside wings, and found flaws, she said without elaborating.  Sounds like a demoralizes workforce, to me. I sure hope there arent loose wrenches sliiding around inside the wings of civilian aircraft, because that would be bad.

[ORGANIZATION]4 also hopes that opening up its technology for motors and batteries, which are key components of electric and fuel-cell vehicles, will increase their supply and help it to cut costs in developing such vehicles. But it remains uncertain whether the use of [ORGANIZATION]4 patents will be as widespread as the carmaker hopes, observers said.

The issue of photorealism in games is a matter of personal taste, a question of aesthetics. Id argue that what people are responding to is the technical mastery. That weve been conditioned to believe more polygons, more particles, newer more advanced shaders are what is crucial and amazing. Beauty can rise up out of ugliness. It is possible. But I cant help but find the reflexive need to fall over these massive commercial ventures and characterise them as beautiful extremely distasteful. We should know better. Most, if not entirely all, game developers who work at triple-A studios dont enjoy many protections from abusive crunch practices massive layoffs as weve just seen at [ORGANIZATION]6 to make earnings calls sound better, or the ability to petition for the kinds of bonuses or residuals they deserve from shipping a title that sells. We know that labour conditions in this industry suck because we know how quickly people burn out and leave. [ORGANIZATION].

But then every now and then  and as the film develops, increasingly often  a human face will enter, and the difference becomes bluntly, laughably obvious. On the left, commuters walk briskly.

Thank you!  This entry was posted in [ORGANIZATION] on [DATE], DATE563 by Lambert Strether64.About [ORGANIZATION]3, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. [PERSON] is the prime example, but tuition-free college and ORG67 also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a PERSON10ebt [PERSON]. Clearly, neither liberal PERSON10emocrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism Because markets. I dont much care about the ism that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second [PERSON] saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I dont much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue  and this is why [PERSON] is always first with me  is the tens of thousands of excess deaths from despair, as described by the Case-PERSON10eaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes [PERSON], at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics  even the worthy fight to help the refugees [ORGANIZATION]4, PERSON35, and [ORGANIZATION]5 wars created  bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow  currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock PERSON10octrine campaigns, one by the ORG69, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the ORG70 and in the press  a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed lets call such voices the left. Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the PERSON10emocrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isnt allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since Ive been blogging about it [ORGANIZATION]9 for [DATE], but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26 top  27  28  29 top  30 AfgdOW4zUErJqxb3.99  31 top  32 top  33 OQF5gjc4GoiK3aYL.99  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64"

[ORGANIZATION] is ten[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2er in his recollection of those [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2runken, Polish celebrations of [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]7us Day. However, he resembles or mo[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2els himself on Barack P[ORGANIZATION]SON14in his bipartisan inclinations, in the value he puts on being able to work across the aisle, in his public [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2isplays of an always equitable temper. An[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 also in how he has been able to be openly gay in the most mainstream of political arenas.38 Back [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2uring P[ORGANIZATION]SON14s first campaign, the wor[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 was that his a[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2visers [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2i[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2nt want him to call too much attention to his being black. After all, he nee[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2e[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 only to show up to get the point across. [ORGANIZATION], on the other h[P[ORGANIZATION]SON], ha[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 to go publicly from situational passing for straight to being out [P[ORGANIZATION]SON] in office. We blush for him in the romantic paragraphs of his book when he remembers going [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2own on one knee to propose to [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]5 at the [INSTITUTION]. He has been criticize[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 for not being gay enough. Something similar was once sai[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 about P[ORGANIZATION]SON14 not being black enough.

But then black voters are so morally oppose[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 to Agent Oranges gangsterism, have so ha[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 enough of [ORGANIZATION]9 collusion that the split between mo[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2erate [P[ORGANIZATION]SON] progressive factions in [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]0 was maybe not as meaningful to them as the question that cannot yet be answere[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 Who can win? I won[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2ere[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 if the longing for community ra[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2iate[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 by every speaker at the supper wasnt gratifie[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 by the black vote being a bloc vote once the primaries are over. Black people for the most part [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2o not vote against their own interestsalthough not voting is a form of voting for the wrong si[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2e.

Assessing the Democratic presidential primary at this point is a nearly impossible task.

Like the Republican primary in DATE17, small changes in the polling position of candidates can translate to a large change in their position relatiPERSON28 to one another, which in turn incentivizes rising candidates to stay in.

He joined up with other like-minded people to form Connect[PERSON]259, a small organization dedicated to envisioning a neighborhood free of PERSON27-980. The key thing is that this is public land, [ORGANIZATION]2 said. Public land is for the public good. We should be seeking to maximize the public good, not just accepting whatePERSON28r happens to already be there.

But to me, as someone who shares some of the policy goals of [ORGANIZATION]2 advocates, it seems crazy to giPERSON28 up on taxes as an important source of rePERSON28nue for vital social programs  to define taxes as, in a sense, irrelevant to goPERSON28rnment spending  at a time when the public, finally, seems to [ORGANIZATION] an appetite for [ORGANIZATION], wealth taxes and similar ambitious policies. At such a moment, why embrace a theory that has nePERSON28r been tested on a significant scale? To shift toward an economic theory that sees taxes as largely irrelevant to goPERSON28rnment spending is economically and politically unwise.

Let me briefly explain them. PERSON27 [PERSON] in uniPERSON28rsal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. [PERSON]9 is the prime example, but tuition-free college and [ORGANIZATION]0 also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservatiPERSON28 Republicans can deliPERSON28r on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism Because markets. PERSON27 dont much care about the ism that deliPERSON28rs the benefits, although whichePERSON28r one does [ORGANIZATION] to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second [PERSON]5 saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. PERSON27 dont much care, as long as the benefits are deliPERSON28red. To me, the key issue  and this is why [PERSON]9 is always first with me  is the tens of thousands of excess deaths from despair, as described by the [PERSON]6-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes [PERSON]9, at the PERSON28ry least, a moral and strategic imperatiPERSON28. And that lePERSON28l of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics  ePERSON28n the worthy fight to help the refugees [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8, and [PERSON]9 wars created  bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow  currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock [PERSON] campaigns, one by the [ORGANIZATION]1, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the [ORGANIZATION]2 and in the press  a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that PERSON27 regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or ePERSON28n rePERSON28rses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies [ORGANIZATION] achiePERSON28d? PERSON27 am also PERSON28ry hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those PERSON27 [ORGANIZATION] listed lets call such voices the left.

Whats the difference between [LOCATION] project idea, and an opportunity zone project? One word [ORGANIZATION], notes [ORGANIZATION], founder of the [ORGANIZATION]. Cities with shovel-ready plans for downtowns and neighborhoods, which are also [ORGANIZATION]s, could see many of their projects move forward more quickly. These cities offer a wide variety of sizes and locations in urban and suburban contexts. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], a small city [TIME] from [ORGANIZATION], is one example of a [STREET] with extensive new urban plans and Opportunity Zones. The market demand for urbanism will continue to grow in [ORGANIZATION], and such cities could offer an affordable urban lifestyle alternative to central city neighborhoods. The more investment comes in via [ORGANIZATION]s, the more value will grow in a [STREET] like [ORGANIZATION].FAC0 rendering. Source City of [ORGANIZATION]The FAC0 former foundry on FAC1 communitys ultimate goal is to create a more livable and sustainable community in Old Town [ORGANIZATION] and GPE3 [STREET] where residents can live where they work, walk to shop, and have easy access to nature and recreation, according to anOppsites listing3. For another illustration, see [PERSON], [PERSON], where a new downtown is being built for a suburban city with no existing walkable downtownon 105-acre former [INSTITUTION] site see rendering at top of article. Downtown [PERSON]s plan comprises 2,300 residential units, including substantial affordable housing, and 1.7 million square feet of commercial uses, such as a grocery store, shops, restaurants, a movie theater, and office space. There will be 18 publicly accessible parks and civic spaces. Construction of the first phase is well underway. It is likely that Downtown [PERSON] would be built without an opportunity zoneyet the [ORGANIZATION] status will give the project a lift and reduce the likelihood of it stalling. When all of the phases are built out, the city has plans to make the downtown even larger by extending the [STREET] grid to adjacent sites. Notes one city official [LOCATION] land control allows us to better negotiate getting affordable housing. We highly value equity and inclusivity and think it should be part of our vision. Downtown [PERSON] is designed as a [STREET] that will grow incrementally over time, serving as the center of public life in a community that has evolved from a purely suburban growth paradigm, explains the project designers, ORG2Partners. All of downtown GPE6 and surrounding neighborhoods are Opportunity Zones. Downtown GPE6s resurgence [LOCATION] is well known, but parts of the city center have received relatively little investment. The creation of a new public space on the west side of LOC2 is spurring development.FAC2 was built to anchor an emerging district, spur economic growth within the neighborhood, and provide a high-quality gathering space for GPE6 residents.FAC2. Source livingLABand TouloukianTouloukianThrough an inclusive community engagement process, an idea for a pop-up park on a large vacant parcel grew over time into a plan, and then construction, of a permanent square with a restaurant, community gathering space, and large circular lawn. Located on FAC3, one of downtowns five radiating arteries, the park serves as a gateway to downtown from the west, and will make investment into the area through [LOCATION] more attractive. The transformation of this space is nothing short of remarkable, says Mayor [PERSON]. GPE7, a city of 52,000 in [LOCATION], is not a [STREET] that is well known nationally for its urban revival. Yet GPE7 adopted a plan for a 400 million, 90-acre LOC4 across from downtown. The district offers a setting for a great deal of urbanist development, including a thousand housing units, 170,000 square feet of retail space, 110,000 square feet of office space, and a hotelall in [LOCATION]. A project like this in a small city may seem unlikely, but it is moving forward quickly. GPE7 Common Council [PERSON] a development loan to support a major project in the district, including a supermarket and 134 residential units. Planning is by [LOCATION] and ORG5.Town square at the heart of the GPE7 LOC4.The rules for Opportunity Zones are still not finalized, and the impact of this federal program will not be known for some time. That said, Opportunity Zones aregenerating interest5at a level that indicates this program will live up to its hypewith regard to level of investment. Significant potential for urbanism lies outside of central locations in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] cities. This potential is likely to get a boost from Opportunity Zones. The biggest support willcome where the public sector has established the ground rules and infrastructure for compact urbanism.  1  2  3  4  5"

south bend,2020-02-10T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,South Bend Tribune,"homeless, homelessness, housing crisis, affordable housing","DATE0, Running for President Means Talking About the Housing Crisis","[ORGANIZATION] found that in [ORGANIZATION], 38 percent of all renter households were rent burdened, an increase of about 19 percent from [LOCATION]. In [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], where Democratic hopeful [ORGANIZATION] is mayor, there are 400 homeless households. In former Mayor [PERSON] town, there are nearly 60,000 people living in homeless shelters. According to [ORGANIZATION], almost 7 million housing units are needed to make up for the lack of affordable housing stock in the country. DATE2, the [ORGANIZATION] administration took steps that could have a heavy impact on the future of housing, such as creating ORG2, chaired by [ORGANIZATION], which will look at ways to reform local zoning laws that prevent the construction of multifamily housing units. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] proposed a revision to the [ORGANIZATION] administrations anti-discrimination Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule Secretary [PERSON] proposed that rules implementation and method be left up to local jurisdictions rather than the federal government. Some candidates have come up with comprehensive, ambitious housing plans while others have proposed more modest responses. Housing policy experts and advocates say this is the first time in modern history that housing has become a main presidential issue and also the first time moderators asked a question about affordable [PERSON]g during a nationally televised Democratic presidential debates. The core of the crisis is the lack of affordable housing for lower income households, and voters are interested in knowing the candidates housing plans before they make a vote, says [PERSON], the president and CEO of [LOCATION]. In some cities and towns, there are enough apartments or housing-but there are not enough households who can afford those housing units.Its a multifaceted problem, and there are already federal programs in [STREET] aimed at addressing some aspects of italthough they appear to be falling short. The mix of targets and tools means the candidates plans share broad similarities and some striking differences.Theres actually quite a bit of overlap, says [ORGANIZATION], a fellow at [ORGANIZATION] at ORG6. The first is that they acknowledge that there are people who have low incomes who cant afford housing. Thats basically a national problem that everywhere in the country, there are some people who just earn so little that they cant afford to pay rent that would cover the operating costs on a basic apartment.The second big box idea is that they need to talk about is the fact that in some places like GPE2 and [PERSON], we havent been building enough new housing to keep up with demand, and most of the candidates have acknowledged that, adds PERSON8. And then the third big point, is talking about racial disparities in housing markets the past history of discrimination for things like mortgage lending and the degree of racial segregation that still exists in most cities.Of course, comparing what the candidates propose is just one lens. Whether the ideas are legally, financially and politically viable is another key test. With that in mind, heres a detailed look at the key housing proposals from candidates in [ORGANIZATION].PERSON9 specificsFor [PERSON], [PERSON]0 served as a GPE4 senator until he became Vice President in the [ORGANIZATION] administration. During his time as Senator, [PERSON]1 co-sponsored or sponsored 11 pieces of legislation related to housing and development ranging from [ORGANIZATION]-which allowed the [ORGANIZATION] secretary to purchase vacant, single-family homes-to the Fair Housing Amendments Act of [ORGANIZATION] to include persons with disabilities including other measures. The Fair Housing Amendments Act, which expanded the forms of discrimination deemed violative of fair-housing laws, and enlarged the list of classes protected from housing discrimination to include the disabled. [PERSON]1 in [LOCATION]. Although [PERSON]1 has not released a comprehensive housing plan like his rivals [PERSON]2, [PERSON]3, [PERSON]4 or [ORGANIZATION]0  [PERSON]1s campaign does focus on investing in the middle class through entrepreneurship and community investments.We have spoken to almost every candidate and I am bewildered that [PERSON]1 has not put out a plan yet, says [PERSON]6.The [PERSON]1 campaign raised 61 million at last report. After retirees and law firms, the real estate industry is the third-biggest source of [PERSON]1s contributions, according to ORG7. Dozens of smaller contributions in increments ranging from 2.50 to 5,600 were made by several GPE2 real-estate developers. Other contributions include 3,500 from [PERSON]8 a GPE5-based developer. [PERSON]4 A vow to cut homelessnessAs mayor of the nations largest city for DATE8, Mike [PERSON]4 oversaw the largest public housing authority in the country, ran a [INSTITUTION] system under a unique local legal right to shelter and helped regulate one of the largest biggest real-estate markets in the world. That gives him a deeper track record  for praise andor scrutiny  than any of the other candidates in the race, even the other mayors [ORGANIZATION]0, currently, and, formerly, [ORGANIZATION]1.That record is decidedly mixed. [PERSON]4 rezoned 40 percent of the city, but some of those zonings prevented any increase in affordable housing. His housing plan generated lots of units 165,000 but many of them were unaffordable to the neighborhoods in which they were built. He made big promises on reducing homelessness, but cut off the supply of Section 8 and public housing to the shelters. Until late in his term, he did little for [ORGANIZATION]4.[PERSON]4 laid out his housing plan for the nation in DATE9. He plans on guaranteeing housing vouchers to all Americans at or below 30 percent of the area median income, which is an estimated 28,830 for a household of three help families stay in their homes by funding emergency financial assistance expand federal grants to cities that implement effective eviction prevention programs and create pilot programs for tenant counseling and legal-advice services. He would also raise [ORGANIZATION] and increase [ORGANIZATION] for low-income households. Mike [PERSON]4 For access to housing, [PERSON]4 plans on recruiting more landlords into the voucher system and reducing the red tape within that system. He says he will use regulation and incentives to mitigate discrimination by landlords. He will also establish navigator services to help tenants find and secure housing. Additionally, [PERSON]4 plans to cut the homeless population in half using existing federal resources coupled with initiatives by local governments. He wants to double federal spending on homelessness from under 3 billion to 6 billion [LOCATION]0. He says he will increase federal support for housing-first strategies and provide housing-search support and short-term rental assistance. As preventative measures, he wants to expand the promotion of rapid-rehousing and permanent supportive housing, providing stability to the chronically homeless to address issues such as substance use disorder and mental-health services where needed and serving as a bridge to rental assistance. He will also integrate homeless support with critical wrap-around services and expand federal grants to cities that implement effective homelessness prevention programs.In order to increase housing supply, [PERSON]4 plans on increasing funding for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and prioritizing new transportation funding for areas that have undertaken progressive zoning reform and reward municipalities that support affordable housing development in neighborhoods with good schools, transportation, and economic opportunity. He will also provide funding for public housing by streamlining [ORGANIZATION] program and increasing funding to ORG9. Additionally, his plan will provide resources to help homeowners, building owners, and tenants for energy-saving renovations. He will also increase funding for energy retrofits and fully fund the existing Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program which helps mitigate home energy, weatherization and energy-related minor home repairs costs. For tenants, [PERSON]4 wants to help renters become homeowners through a pilot program targeted to assist people with down payments for new homes, provide federal matching funds to offer all residents of the 100 communities as down payment and expand access to financial services. His goal includes one million new African-American homeowners. For local governments, [PERSON]4 wants streamline investments to address the housing crisis by building on President [ORGANIZATION]s Strong Cities, [ORGANIZATION] initiative by driving an interagency effort from [ORGANIZATION]0. The [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]1 initiative was created to give technical assistance to local governments in order to execute their economic vision and strategies through public and private partnerships. [PERSON]4, a billionaire, is financing his own campaign to the tune of 200 million so far and is not accepting contributions. [ORGANIZATION]0 Douglass Plan targets vacant-land potentialDecades younger than most of his presidential rivals , [ORGANIZATION] came onto the campaign stage with experience as mayor of [ORGANIZATION]. His housing plan was released [LOCATION]2 [LOCATION]3 along with several other plans to help middle-to low-income households by lowering child care costs, making college more affordable, lowering health care costs and furthering consumer rights protections. [ORGANIZATION]0s housing plan is similar in scope to Senators [PERSON]2 and [PERSON]3s housing plans. He will invest 430 billion to create access to affordable housing for over 7 million households and to create an additional 2 million housing units through creation and preservation initiatives. He also plans on working to reform local zoning laws. He wants to also invest in homeownership and is looking to facilitate homeownership of one million low-income households. Refoming zoning is a common theme among the Democrats. PERSON8 says this is new territory for federal policy.  Because thats really new, its hard to say at this point that any of those are more likely to succeed or even more likely to get adopted, she says.Another [ORGANIZATION]0 plan is to target redlined neighborhoods part of a comprehensive plan, known as [ORGANIZATION], to mitigate racial and income in equities, particularly in communities of color. The Douglass Plan lists several initiatives ranging from criminal justice to health equity reforms. Mayor [ORGANIZATION] Within [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]0s housing agenda includes the Community Homestead Act in which cities would apply for federal funding to operate land banks to acquire vacant properties and provide them to low-income families under a [LOCATION]4 residency obligation.PERSON8 notes [ORGANIZATION] offers more to cities like [ORGANIZATION] or GPE6 or GPE7 where there are swathes of land with city-owned houses in certain poor conditions, but was not tailored for larger cities where vacant space is rare.It is not the first time [ORGANIZATION]0 has pushed to create housing. After he was elected to Mayor of [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]1, he created a task force to analyze the citys vacancy stock which identified 1,900 vacant and 1,275 abandoned properties to renovate and reuse. In a report, similar to [ORGANIZATION], the task force recommended establishing a land bank to encourage neighborhood revitalization efforts such as renovating homes with violations. In response in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]0 launched a 1,000 Homes in a [DATE] initiative with a budget of 10.5 million dollars funded by [ORGANIZATION]s [ORGANIZATION] program, [ORGANIZATION]2, and the states Blight Elimination Program3, a program to bring up property value through revitalization efforts. According to [ORGANIZATION]4, the initiative has met with some success. The city handled 1,122 houses 427 were repaired, 569 were demolished, 10 were deconstructed, six were set aside for repair by community development corporations, and 110 were under contract for demolition. Despite the success, the initiative also came under criticism for displacing some families from debilitated housing, instead of fixing their homes. The [ORGANIZATION] city administration argued that those homes had not been occupied for [LOCATION]5, according to [ORGANIZATION] Tribune5. [ORGANIZATION]0s campaign fundraising has topped 76 million, with an estimated 932,988 from individuals connected to real estate groups, according to ORG7.[ORGANIZATION]5 A broad if modest plan Sen. [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]5 Senator [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]5s rise began when she became GPE8 Attorney. She became the first woman elected Senator in her state in [LOCATION]6 just [LOCATION]7 shy of the [LOCATION]8 foreclosure crisis. At the cusp of the crisis, [ORGANIZATION]5 co-sponsored several [ORGANIZATION] measures ranging from the bills to protect mortgage applicants to an amendment to the tax code allowing some flexibility for homeowners who originally financed their mortgages through a qualified subprime loan. Since then, she has cosponsored several measures to mitigate homelessness, end discrimination against victims of domestic violence, and create easier access to the federal housing voucher program, among over 30 other housing and development bills and amendments. Akin to the housing plans proposed by [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]8 and [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]5s housing plan is focused on creating affordable housing, mitigating homelessness and creating paths to homeownership but she focuses on tweaking several existing federal programs. [ORGANIZATION]5 plans to fight housing discrimination by creating a new federal grant program for access to free legal counsel for people facing evictions prohibiting discrimination based on income source or the blacklisting of tenants who have been evicted in the past modifying the current Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule and restoring [ORGANIZATION]4 to monitor fair lending practices whose authority has been reduced by the [ORGANIZATION] administration. For tenants, she plans on expanding rental assistance for affordable housing in rural towns by improving access to existing federal programs, and through the purchasing power of [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6, her administration will encourage lenders to serve rural mortgage markets. Additionally, she will expand support for affordable senior housing and direct affordable housing programs to allow retrofitting of rental housing for seniors. She also has plans for major investments in [ORGANIZATION] pilot program, which allows families to use their vouchers in higher opportunity neighborhoods. Additionally, [ORGANIZATION]5 plans on tackling outdated zoning policies by incentivizing cities who change their zoning policies with federal housing and infrastructure grants. As a path to prevent future evictions, she wants to create a personal savings account called UP Accounts for retirement and emergencies. Under her UP Accounts plan, employers will set aside at least 50 cents per hour worked to help people build more than 600,000 in wealth over the course of a career. The funds could also be accessed during emergencies that cause delayed payments for rent. [ORGANIZATION]5 also plans to expand [ORGANIZATION] for developing affordable rental housing and investing in homeless assistance grants that provide emergency and long-term housing. She proposes a new federal tax credit, similar to [ORGANIZATION], to encourage investment in family-owned homes in distressed neighborhoods. She also wants to build on existing programs to allow certain types of rental housing assistance to be used for homeownership expenses and also plans on proposing legislation that will expand access to capital for down payments. She also wants to allow credit bureaus to use on-time payment data from cell phone bills, utilities, and rent in calculating credit scores so it is easier to build credit. During [LOCATION]9 of her presidency, [ORGANIZATION]5 plans on strengthening Community Reinvestment Act protections, developing policies to encourage financial institutions to make loans and investment in local communities. [ORGANIZATION]5 also wants to focus on educating first-time homebuyers through improving education programs that especially target communities with low levels of homeownership. [ORGANIZATION]5 also plans on reversing the [ORGANIZATION] Administrations proposed changes to federal housing subsidies and updating regulations for reverse mortgages, especially for seniors. Her plan for funding some of these existing and new programs will come from raising the capital gains rate to the income tax rate for households making over 400,000, and part of her infrastructure plan, which includes plans for housing, will raise the corporate tax rate to 25 percent.According to [ORGANIZATION]7 [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]5s campaign has raised an estimated 29 million dollars. Her campaign has raised an estimated 300,741 dollars6 from the real estate industry ranging from a maximum of 2,800 to even one dollar7 in donations, according to ORG7 and the [ORGANIZATION]8. Next to [PERSON]1s punt, [ORGANIZATION]5 offers the most modest plan among the major Democratic candidates.[ORGANIZATION]1 Rent control and moreLast year in DATE20, Senator [PERSON]2 introduced a 2.5 trillion plan to mitigate the growing housing crisis across the country.[ORGANIZATION]1 plans to invest 1.48 trillion in [ORGANIZATION]9 in order to create, preserve and rehabilitate permanently affordable housing units within mixed-income development. An additional 400 billion will be invested to build 2 million mixed-income social housing units also administered through [ORGANIZATION]9. He also plans on investing an additional 500 million dollars in the GPE9 ORG20 ORG21 Section 515 program, an existing rural rental housing loans program to provide affordable rental housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families, elderly persons, and persons with disabilities. [ORGANIZATION]1 calls for increasing funding for ORG22 to 3 billion to build, preserve, and rehabilitate affordable housing in Indian country. [ORGANIZATION]1 also plans on investing 70 billion dollars in improving public housing, including to provide broadband services, and wants to repeal the Faircloth Amendment which does not allow [ORGANIZATION] to construct new public housing units. Sen. [PERSON]2 On Section 8, [ORGANIZATION]1 plans on fully funding the rental assistance program with 410 billion dollars over DATE21 and making it a mandatory funding program for all eligible households. He also plans on expanding and strengthening the enforcement of the Small Area Fair Market Rent rule, which reforms voucher payments to help recipients move to higher-opportunity neighborhoods. When it comes to tenant protections, [ORGANIZATION]1 proposal for national rent regulation would cap DATE22 rent increases at no more than 3 percent while allowing landlords to apply for waivers if significant capital improvements are made on the property. [PERSON]2 has a proposal for whats essentially nationwide rent-control, which is [STREET] outside the box of anything thats been discussed before and Im not totally clear whether thats constitutional. And it would be very difficult to implement, PERSON30 says. He also plans to implement a just-cause requirement for evictions. Additionally, he wants to provide 2 billion towards states and localities right to counsel programs for tenants facing evictions or foreclosure proceedings, or at risk of losing their Section 8 rental assistance.[ORGANIZATION]1 also wants to streamline the review process and direct funding towards implementing fair and inclusive zoning ordinances with a focus on communities that face gentrification. For example, he proposes to [STREET] a 25 percent house flipping tax on speculators who sell a non-owner-occupied property, if the property is sold for more than its purchase price within [DATE] of the procurement. Another proposal from [ORGANIZATION]1 will impose a 2 percent Empty Homes tax on the property value of vacant, owned homes. Hes called for creating an independent agency to protect Section 8 renters from discriminatory landlords, fully funding the existing ORG23 at 1 billion over DATE21 and ensuring formerly incarcerated residents are not excluded from public housing options. [ORGANIZATION]1 wants to use 25,000 ORG24 units in DATE23 for homeless households and also double the funding for the ORG25 homelessness assistance grants to over 26 billion over DATE24 to build permanent supportive housing. Additionally, he plans on providing 500 million in funding to states and localities for homeless outreach programs. [ORGANIZATION]1 also wants to invest 50 billion over DATE25 to provide grants for community land trusts and other shared equity homeownership models and invest an additional 15 billion to enact a 21st Century Homestead Act, which will revitalize abandoned properties and historically disadvantaged communities. For first-time home buyers, he wants to invest an additional 2 billion in ORG21 and an additional 6 billion in [ORGANIZATION] to create a first-time homebuyer assistance program that will increase home ownership. [ORGANIZATION]1 campaign has raised the most money110 millionamong his Democratic counterparts for the [PERSON] presidential elections. According to ORG7, almost 380,000 was donated by members of real-estate groups.[ORGANIZATION]8 Aiming to limit FAC0 roleSen. [PERSON]3 got her start as an academic and became an advisor to ORG26 in [DATE]. But her profile grew after she spoke as a proponent of heavier regulations on banks, especially after the role they played in the [LOCATION]8 financial crisis. Her plan revolves around four main goals reducing rents for lower- and middle- class families closing the racial barriers to housing that the federal government created DATE27 with redlining removing other kinds of discrimination from affordable housing and finally, ending FAC0 heavy influence on the housing market. Sen. [PERSON]3 [ORGANIZATION]8s plan promises 500 billion over DATE25 to build and rehabilitate affordable housing, with almost all of that going to ORG27, a [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing production program. The leftover cash includes over 500 million going into the ORG21s Rural Housing Service8, 2.5 billion into the Indian Housing Block Grant9 and [ORGANIZATION], and 4 billion into creating a new grant called ORG29, designed to help fund housing construction for middle-class families specifically in areas where affordable housing is scarce. A large portion of the 500 billion will be shouldered by private-public partnerships, which puts [ORGANIZATION]8 in line with President [ORGANIZATION]s housing policy.11 To pay for the rest, the bill proposes a lower cap on the estate tax. Instead of taxing inheritances starting at 22 million, [ORGANIZATION]8 proposes the tax start at 7 million, adding about 14,000 more multi-million dollar families to the pool of funding.[ORGANIZATION]8 promises to curb cities exclusionary zoning policies, like mandatory parking requirements12, development fees or minimum lot sizes, which a report from [ORGANIZATION]13 says caused a massive increase in segregation. [ORGANIZATION]8s plan to incentivize cities to axe these policies? [PERSON] a 10 billion carrot. Her bill proposes a new grant program that cities can apply for in order to build infrastructure, schools or parks. [ORGANIZATION]8 also plans to dismantle the effects of redlining14. [ORGANIZATION]8 proposes a substantial housing grant for residents in affected neighborhoods, provided that they have lived there for DATE29, qualify as low-income and are first-time home-buyers. The grant is aimed towards eliminating or easing the cost of a down payment on a home for minorities in disadvantaged areas. She also plans on expanding rights under the Fair Housing Act, which currently prohibits landlords from discriminating on the basis of sex or race. Her bill proposes to expand the act to include sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, veteran status, and the source of ones income, like a housing voucher.When the [ORGANIZATION]0 acquires single-family homes through foreclosure, it often sells those homes to private equity firms like [ORGANIZATION]1. These firms, in turn, will hike up the price of those homes. [ORGANIZATION]8s plan aims to stop this cycle. [ORGANIZATION]8 would mandate that a minimum of 75 percent of these foreclosed homes are sold directly to an individual owneroccupant, or to a community group that will rehabilitate the home and sell it directly to an owneroccupant. Her plans for tenants focus on rent-burdened households by investing 500 billion over DATE21 to create, preserve, and rehabilitate over 3 million affordable housing units for lower-income families and her plan would lower rents by 10 percent. According to the [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]8 has raised 82 million. Her campaign has seen an estimated 255,181 dollars from members of the real-estate industry, per ORG7.A broader discussionAs part of [ORGANIZATION]s campaign [ORGANIZATION] which started [LOCATION]2, the national housing advocacy group has issued a list of recommendations it hopes will guide candidates and, eventually, the next presidential administration.The [ORGANIZATION]2 recommendations are four-fold. The first is to preserve and produce deeply affordable homes to meet the 7 million unit shortageat a cost of at least 40 billion, plus another 50 billion dollar investment in repairing public housing. The second policy is funding rental cash assistance and the third recommendation is emergency cash assistance for households who may have faced a medical emergency and lack the funds to pay rent for a period of time. The last policy recommendation is to protect tenants from all discrimination and abuses. PERSON8 believes the housing policy discussion needs to expand even more, to discuss the environmental impactespecially in the context of climate changeof building housing in car-dependent suburbs, and to address the role of housing value in perpetuating the racial wealth gap. Most middle income households, their largest financial asset is the equity in their home thats been pretty detrimental to African-American and [ORGANIZATION] households who are less likely to be homeowners or they become homeowners later in life and tend to buy houses in neighborhoods where prices dont appreciate as much, she says. So the homeownership strategy has created this very large racial wealth gap, and theyre sort of nibbling around the edges of that, but not actually addressing the fact that there are some limits to using homeownership. None of them have explicitly linked this to is there another [STREET] that we can help Americans save money and develop wealth thats not tied to home ownership.Read deeper [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]4, [ORGANIZATION]5, [ORGANIZATION]6 and in [LOCATION], the Fight for Americas Soul in [PERSON] is About Land16 The post [ORGANIZATION]0, Running for President Means Talking About the Housing Crisis17 appeared first on [ORGANIZATION]7.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18"

Other than that, its a great [STREET] to live.52 A New GPE2 Muslim Colleges Islamist Ties53 ORG3 [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], recently declared the establishment of an Islamic university at its premises, [ORGANIZATION] that will provide higher Islamic education to the [PERSON]n Muslim community as well as serve as a seminary that would prepare imams for mosques in [ORGANIZATION]. The foundation of [ORGANIZATION] is a joint effort between the [ORGANIZATION] and ORG6 in GPE5, [PERSON]. The identities of the founders and faculty of the university are deeply concerning and suggest the seminary will be promoting an Islamist ideology to Muslim students in [PERSON] and throughout GPE6. In the video announcing the colleges founding, ORG7 is represented by its [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] has extensive ties to Islamist groups linked to [ORGANIZATION], including serving as a board member and president of the GPE2 chapter of ORG9 ORG10, and currently vice-president and formerly Secretary General of the Islamic Society of [ORGANIZATION] ISNA.

Meanwhile, 28 of Democrats say [PERSON] should be banned from joining pro-gun rights organizations like the ORG13  a view surprisingly shared by 15 of Republicans and 10 of unaffiliated voters. Just 13 of likely voters believe ORG13 members are more likely to commit a crime with a gun  and in fact 47 believe that members are less likely to commit such a crime. 28 think ORG13 membership makes no difference vs. the general population. The poll also revealed that 50 of voters have a favorable impression of the ORG13, while 44 do not. Of that, 30 have a Very Favorable view of the group, while 33 have a [ORGANIZATION] one  virtually the same opinion as those polled held in [DATE]. As we noted on [ORGANIZATION], the ORG13 has sued the city and county of GPE7 after its ORG16 declared it a domestic terrorist organization. Filed in the [PERSON] ORG17 for GPE9, the suit accuses city officials of violating the groups free speech rights for political purposes, and claims the city is attempting to create a blacklist to prevent ORG13-associated individuals from doing business there, according to ORG18. The lawsuit asks the [STREET] to instruct elected officials that freedom of speech means you cannot silence or punish those with whom you disagree.56 PERSON2 Was Asked to [ORGANIZATION], Book Claims57 PERSON2 was asked to leave a hippie commune in [DATE] for sitting around and talking about politics instead of working, according to a forthcoming book.

Their resignations signal two things from [PERSON]. The first is the realization that [PERSON]7 is now lost. The second is that this loss is due entirely to the changing demographics resulting from legal and illegal immigration. The five congressmen that have resigned are [PERSON]7 17th, [PERSON]8 23rd, [PERSON]9 22nd, PERSONDATE19 DATE12, and PERSON21 11th. Of these five, Congressman PERSON22 is unique in that his district will likely remain red for some time. He has not faced an opponent in numerous election cycles As noted, the reason for this is simple demographics. For DATE13, the Republicans have told their voters that they were going to clamp down on illegal immigration and address the legal immigration policies that have facilitated this takeover. They have made excuse after excuse for not fulfilling those promises and now that lack of action is turning [PERSON]7 blue one district at a time.72 ORG25 Publishes New Uncorroborated Allegation Against PERSON23 by Former Classmate73 If you think the left is done whining about PERSON23, guess again. On [TIME], the ORG25 published a rehash of the previous bogus allegations against now-ORG27 Justice PERSON23, particularly the allegations made by PERSON24, and threw in a brand new one for good measure. PERSON25 had claimed PERSON23 exposed himself to her at a party at ORG28. Despite the potentially dozens of witnesses that would have seen this occur, PERSON25s story went uncorroborated throughout the entire confirmation process. If I had done that, it would have been the talk of campus, PERSON26 said in an interview with ORG18 PERSON27 No Matter Who Wins in DATE11, There Will be Blood75 The machinations of an illiberal left, on display in its ever-increasing violence accompanied by the ululations of a propagandist media in contravention of an imaginary white supremacist right, have riven the nation into diametrically opposed camps. The right will never accept socialism, while the left will accept nothing less. [ORGANIZATION] Wins Those on the left will not allow a [ORGANIZATION] victory, even should he win the popular vote and [LOCATION]. They are used to getting what they want and like spoiled brats, have learned that tantrums work. Should Donald [ORGANIZATION] prevail in his bid for a second term, the left will go insane, deploying every insurance policy weapon at their disposal to negate [PERSON] of the Orange Man. What PERSON30, PERSON8, and PERSON31 et al. did to [ORGANIZATION] in his first term will seem mild in comparison to what the left is planning should he win.76 [PERSON]8 Public Schools Excusing Students Who Plan on Participating in Upcoming Climate Strike77 [PERSON]9 public schools announced [TIME] that they will excuse students who plan on attending various climate strikes throughout the city.

Though the company says alternative plans are in [STREET] to temporarily make up for the shortfall, such as tapping [ORGANIZATION]6s global storage network, the 5.7 million barrels DATE8 outage is the single worst supply disruption even over and against that brought on by the first Gulf War and the [DATE]9 Islamic Revolution in [PERSON]0.108 Oil Prices Soar After Attacks on Saudi Facilities109 Oil prices hit their highest in [PERSON]0 after two attacks on Saudi Arabian facilities on DATE14 knocked out more than 5 of global supply.

Third, they want to elevate the ideas of non-Christians to change traditional thinking. Hard to believe, but lets look. The Left wants to change the [STREET] culture sees ORG71. We see it on several fronts. The Left wants to divide the church about what is right and wrong. [PERSON] are ready to split on the issue of same-sex marriage. Theres a push among a small but loud faction of liberal voices that declare themselves exvangelicals, who resist the churchs stance of [ORGANIZATION] issues and abortion but want to retain and redefine what it means to be a Christian in DATE1919. In redefining ORG71, they want to shift the emphasis from a changed life to doing what they define as societal good.136 Thousands of [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON] Home of Abortionist Whose License Was Suspended for Performing Abortion on [ORGANIZATION]5 Dr. [PERSON]3 has been called LOC5 most prolific serial killer.

[PERSON]4 was later convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and hundreds of lesser charges, and in DATE1913 was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In [ORGANIZATION]2 DATE1918, filmmakers [PERSON]5 and [PERSON]6 released [PERSON]4 The Trial of LOC5 Biggest Serial Killer. The film is the shocking true story of the investigation and trial of Dr. [PERSON]3  his [ORGANIZATION]8 killing spree and the political and media establishment that tried to cover it up. Now, another gruesome finding tied to a recently deceased abortionist has surfaced in his [PERSON] home. The abortionist took the lives of unborn babies in two locations in [LOCATION]. One of the practices was in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], where ORG73 is located. ORG74 reports  Thousands of unborn children were found in the home of Dr. [PERSON]1, an abortionist who passed away [ORGANIZATION]9.

The remains of 2,246 unborn children have been found inside the GPE57, [PERSON] home of a now-deceased abortionist, Dr. [PERSON]1, who passed away on [ORGANIZATION]0, according to a report by ORG75. As the watchdog group [ORGANIZATION] has extensively documented, [PERSON]7 had a history of abuses, including failing to report statutory rape of a [ORGANIZATION]4 and a [ORGANIZATION]1.

Ill sit and mansplain every detail of the things it does wrong [ORGANIZATION] Im a white male, full of shame My ancestry is evil, and their evil is still not gone140 Why Gen-Zers and Millennials Support Socialism141 Public-opinion polls reflect that large numbers of [PERSON] in their DATE19s and [ORGANIZATION]3 i.e., [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]5s support socialism. When one considers the indoctrination to which these young [PERSON] have been subjected in their state-run educational systems, their preference for socialism actually makes sense. From the first grade, [PERSON]n students are indoctrinated with the notion that they live in a free country, one that has a free-enterprise economic system. By the time they graduate from high school, students have no doubts that this is true. The notion is refortified in those students who go on to college. By the time [PERSON] start their careers, their mindsets are set in concrete They are grateful that they live in a free country. Many of them continue reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which they learned in school and which they were expected to recite [ORGANIZATION]4, a pledge that confirms that in [PERSON] there is liberty for all. Now, look around you. Examine the society in which you live. There are crises, chaos, and mayhem everywhere. ORG79. Health care. Immigration. Federal spending and debt. Monetary. GPE60. [PERSON]3. GPE61. GPE62. [PERSON]. [PERSON]8. Drug war. Forever wars. Secret surveillance. Assassinations. Death. Destruction. Bombings. Terrorism. Mass killings. Tribunals. Torture. Indefinite detention. Militarism. Invasions. Occupations. [PERSON]. Regime-change operations. Trade wars. Sanctions. Embargoes. Police states. Alcoholism. Drug addiction. Homelessness. Poverty. Suicides. Its not a pretty picture, is it? Its a picture of a quite dysfunctional society. In the mind of the [PERSON]er and the [ORGANIZATION]5, that is what comes with freedom and free enterprise. Given such, its perfectly logical to want something else, and that something else happens to be socialism. It even makes sense that so many young people decide to check out of life early through suicide. Theyre thinking, If this is freedom  if this is the best there is  no, thanks. Im leaving and hopefully going on to something better.142 Why Has the Overpopulation Myth Remained So Persistent When its So [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]0 could never have imagined the dizzying capacity for innovation that human beings have shown in [ORGANIZATION]6, as [PERSON]1 observes at ORG19. There were fewer than a billion people on the planet in [ORGANIZATION]7. The [PERSON] is now nearing 8 billion people, and that population is far better fed DATE9 than they were in [ORGANIZATION]7. That population growth, the likes of which [PERSON]0 would have believed unimaginable, has been met, and even exceeded, by food production  to the extent that our government now subsidizes [PERSON]n farmers, to the tune of billions [DATE], in order to incentivize them to not grow excess food on their lands. These efforts exist as a measure to keep prices at profitable levels for farmers, in our governments vainglorious efforts to fix prices in a free market. But government price-fixing aside, shouldnt it be easy to conclude that any assertion that an increasing population invariably leads to famine is extremely illogical, or at the very least, quite simply an incorrect hypothesis? The idea that increased population leads to scarcity of resources is seductive, however, and has remained incredibly persistent, despite all the evidence that has proven it false over the [ORGANIZATION]1.144  [DATE]  4 370393  5 370455  [DATE]  7 370439  [DATE]  9 370483  [DATE] 370461  12 370423  13 370457  [DATE]  [DATE] 370479  21 370475  22 370388  [DATE]  [DATE][DATE][DATE]31 [DATE]  [DATE]  33 370425  [DATE][DATE]  [DATE]  41 370435  [DATE]  44 370421  45 370405  [DATE]  47 [DATE]  [DATE]  49  50 topheadline  51  52 topheadline  53  54 topheadline  55  56 topheadline  57  58 topheadline  59  60 topheadline  61  62 topheadline  63  64 topheadline  65  66 topheadline  67  68 topheadline  69  70 topheadline  71  72 topheadline  73  74 topheadline  75  76 topheadline  77  78 topheadline  79  80 topheadline  81  82 topheadline  83  84 topheadline  [DATE] topheadline  87  88 topheadline  89  90 topheadline  91  92 topheadline  93  94 topheadline  95  96 topheadline  97  98 topheadline  99  100 topheadline  101  102 topheadline  103  104 topheadline  105  106 topheadline  107  108 topheadline  109  110 topheadline  111  112 topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117  118 topheadline  119  1DATE19 topheadline  121  122 topheadline  123  124 topheadline  125  126 topheadline  127  128 topheadline  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline"

But we should acknowledge the cruel irony of a [LOCATION] dressed in bluewho dressed like an African for his Christian mission weddingpinning down a Congolese refugee and fatally shooting him in the back of the head in the name of self-defense. Not only was PERSON10 [ORGANIZATION] the victim of a violent reality in [PERSON] where Black people are nearly three times as likely to be killed by police than white people8. He was also the victim of [PERSON]n austerity economics where policing stands in as a response to the defunding of social [PERSON] and resettlement means acculturating to the impossible mathematics of pulling oneself up by their bootstraps without a safety net.

Resettlement in [PERSON] relies heavily on the notion of self-sufficiency, treating newcomers as [PERSON]n low-income workers and denying them crucial services for integrating into [PERSON]n economic and social life. But the story doesnt end there. Where state and federal support services fall short, the growing Congolese refugee community in [PERSON]0 has been working hard to uplift and support its members. Pastor PERSON16 who was close to PERSON10 runs a nonprofit called African Community [PERSON]217.

I thought it was a safe [STREET], but it seems like we are in danger even when we come here. As [ORGANIZATION] speakers, the [ORGANIZATION]s have relied on translators for interviews. It is unclear from media reports how strong PERSON10s English skills werebut ORG10 reporting7 indicates that language was a barrier for him, possibly even in his encounter with [ORGANIZATION] on [LOCATION]1. [LOCATION]2, [PERSON]0 banned [ORGANIZATION] and Spanish dictionaries in its prisons, claiming that the books contents are a threat to the states penitentiaries.21 But this move begs the question how many among the growing Congolese population in [PERSON]0 are landing in the prison system?

kalamazoo,2020-05-22T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WWMT,homeless,8 ways the coronavirus is more dangerous for veterans,"The largest group served in [ORGANIZATION], where 2.8 million veterans were exposed to Agent Orange9, a chemical defoliant linked to cancer.Younger veterans deployed to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] were exposed to dust storms, oil fires and burn pits with numerous toxins10, and perhaps as a consequence have high rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses11.Age and respiratory illnesses are both risk factors for [ORGANIZATION] mortality. As of [LOCATION], there have been 12,979 people under [ORGANIZATION] care with [ORGANIZATION], of whom 1,100 have died. 2. Dangerous residential facilities [ORGANIZATION] needing end-of-life care, those with cognitive disabilities or those needing substance use treatment often live in crowded [ORGANIZATION] or state-funded residential facilities.State-funded soldiers homes are notoriously starved for money and staff. The horrific situation13 at the soldiers home in GPE2, [PERSON], where more than 79 veteran residents have died from a [ORGANIZATION] outbreak14, illustrates the risk facing the veterans in residential homes. 3. Benefits unfairly denied A transition clerk assists a Reservist with his ORG2 Form 214 as part of the demobilizing process, at FAC0, [DATE]. [PERSON] When a person transitions from active military service to become a veteran, they receive a [ORGANIZATION]. This certificate provides information about the circumstances of the discharge or release. It includes characterizations such as honorable, other than honorable, bad conduct or dishonorable. These are crucial distinctions, because that status determines whether the [ORGANIZATION] will give them benefits16.Research shows that some veterans with discharges that limit their benefits have PTSD symptoms, military sexual trauma or other behaviors related to military stress. [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have disproportionately more17 of these negative discharges than veterans from other eras, for reasons still unclear18.The [ORGANIZATION] frequently and perhaps unlawfully19 denies benefits to veterans with other than honorable discharges.Many veterans have requested upgrades to their discharge status. There is a significant backlog of these upgrade requests20, and the pandemic will add to it, further delaying access to health care and other benefits. 4. Diminished access to healthcare [ORGANIZATION] surgery, routine visits and elective surgeries at [ORGANIZATION] medical centers have been postponed since [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] hospitals are understaffed21 - just before the pandemic, the [ORGANIZATION] reported 43,000 staff vacancies out of more than 400,000 health care staff positions. Access to health care will be even more difficult when those medical centers finally reopen because they may have far fewer workers than they need.As of DATE4, 2,250 [ORGANIZATION] health care workers22 have tested positive for [ORGANIZATION], and thousands of health care workers are under quarantine. The [ORGANIZATION] is asking doctors and [PERSON] to come out of retirement to help already understaffed hospitals. 5. Mental health may get worse [ORGANIZATION] and military personnel at a military job fair in GPE4, [PERSON], [PERSON]. ORG5 An average of 20 veterans die by suicide [ORGANIZATION]. A national task force24 is currently addressing this scourge.But many outpatient mental health programs are on hold or being held [LOCATION]. Some residential mental health facilities have closed26.Under these conditions, the suicide rate for veterans may grow. Suicide hotline calls by veterans were up by 12 on [ORGANIZATION], DATE8 into the [LOCATION]. 6. Complications for homeless veterans and those in the justice system An estimated 45,000 [PERSON] are homeless on any given night, and 181,500 veterans29 are in prison or jail. Thousands more are under [STREET]-supervised substance use and mental health treatment in veterans treatment [DATE]. More than half31 of veterans involved with the justice system have either mental health problems or substance use disorders.As residential facilities close to new participants, many veterans eligible to leave prison or jail have nowhere to go. They may stay incarcerated or become homeless.Courts have moved online32 or ceased formal operations altogether, meaning no veteran charged with a crime can be referred to a treatment [STREET]. It is unclear whether those who were already participating in a treatment program will face delays graduating from [STREET]-supervised treatments.Further, some veterans treatment courts still require participants to take drug tests33. With [ORGANIZATION] circulating, those participants must put their health at risk to travel to licensed testing facilities. 7. Disability benefits delayed ORG6 veteran [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], shakes hands with Filipino World War II veteran PERSON1, 100, during [LOCATION]0 ceremonies at the American cemetery in [LOCATION], GPE7, [LOCATION]1. PERSON2 In the pandemics epicenter in [LOCATION], tens of thousands of veterans34 should have access to [ORGANIZATION] benefits because of their low income - but dont, so far.The pandemic has exacerbated existing delays in finding veterans in need, filing their paperwork and waiting for decisions. PERSON3, an attorney in [LOCATION]s Legal Assistance Group, a nonprofit legal services organization, noted in a personal communication that these benefits are worth tens of millions of dollars to veterans and their families in the midst of a health and economic disaster.All 56 regional [ORGANIZATION] offices are closed35 to encourage social distancing. Compensation and disability evaluations, which determine how much money veterans can get, are usually done in person. Now, they must be done electronically, via telehealth services in which the veteran communicates with a health care provider via computer.But getting telehealth up and running is taking time, adding to the longstanding [ORGANIZATION] backlog36. Currently, more than 100,000 veterans37 wait [LOCATION]2 for a decision. That is what the [ORGANIZATION] defines as a backlog - anything [LOCATION]3 is not considered a delay on benefit claims. 8. Economic catastrophe There are 1.2 million veteran employees in the five industries most severely [ORGANIZATION] by the economic fallout of the coronavirus.A disproportionately high number of post-911 veterans live in some of the hardest-hit communities that depend on these industries. [ORGANIZATION] returning from overseas will face a dire economic landscape, with far fewer opportunities to integrate into civilian life with financial security.In addition, severely disabled veterans living off of [ORGANIZATION] benefits were initially required to file a tax return to get stimulus checks39. This initial filing requirement delayed benefits for severely disabled veterans by [LOCATION]4. The ORG8 finally changed the requirements40 after public outcry, given that many older and severely disabled veterans do not have access to computers or the technological skills to file electronically.There are many social groups to pay attention to, all with their own problems to face during the pandemic. With veterans, many of the problems they face now existed long before the coronavirus arrived on GPE9 shores.But with the challenges posed by the situation [LOCATION]5, veterans who were already lacking adequate benefits and resources are now in deeper trouble, and it will be harder to answer their needs.Editors note This is an updated version of a story41 that originally ran on [LOCATION]6 knowledge, [LOCATION]7.

The ruling comes [ORGANIZATION] before the mask mandate prohibition and various other changes to state law were to go into effect. Along with the ban on face mask mandates, the ruling strikes down several other laws pertaining to [PERSON] mitigation measures and the operation of public schools. That includes laws banning critical race theory in K-12 schools, barring colleges and universities from requiring [PERSON] vaccinations or testing of students, prohibiting K-12 schools from requiring students to receive vaccines that have received emergency authorization from the OPERSON37OPERSON37G1715PE2 [ORGANIZATION], and barring cities and counties from requiring vaccine passports. 62 Despite Over 95 [PERSON], [PERSON]1 Shifts Classes Online After Substantial Outbreak Of [ORGANIZATION]63 Is Zero-[ORGANIZATION] come to [ORGANIZATION]?

In his inaugural address, the new president stressed that We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. [LOCATION]9, PEPERSON37SON25 amplified that goal and applied it with special emphasis to OPERSON37G20 relationship to its [PERSON]an allies in his speech to a virtual version of [ORGANIZATION]. He stated that Im sending a clear message to the world GPE11 is back. The transatlantic alliance is back. And we are not looking backward we are looking forward, together. He added The partnership between [PERSON] and the GPE12, in my view, is and must remain the cornerstone of all that we hope to accomplish in [ORGANIZATION]0, just as we did in [ORGANIZATION]1.

The sense of relief in [PERSON]an circles after the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] was almost palpable. PEPERSON37SON25 gave exactly the speech that many [PERSON]ans wanted to hear, wrote [ORGANIZATION]. It was a widely shared sentiment on the Continent. In the aftermath of the chaotic and humiliating departure of OPERSON37OPERSON37G1715PE2 forces from GPE14, and the reaction of [PERSON]an governments to that episode, the presidents promises and confident hopes of transatlantic unity have been shaken to their core. PEPERSON37SON26, a leading OPERSON37OPERSON37G1715erman politician, described the situation in especially harsh terms. This is the greatest debacle that [ORGANIZATION] has seen since its foundation, and it is an epochal change that we are facing, he stated bluntly.  74 OPERSON37G23 Used Its Dominance to Dictate Online Platform PERSON37ules, Then Launched Its Own Digital ID System to [ORGANIZATION] on [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION]4, [ORGANIZATION], one of the worlds biggest credit card companies, imposed a new policy on who can use its services, specifically around illegal adult content.

Gavin [PERSON] and state lawmakers might have taken on by ordering thousands of unvaccinated kids into distance learning in DATE5. First, Democratic state Sen. Richard [ORGANIZATION] of [PERSON] tabled his controversial bill2 that would have required all children [ORGANIZATION] to be vaccinated against [PERSON] to attend school or child care in person. Support for the proposal had been wavering for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] PERSON5 reports3. That move defaulted the state back to [PERSON]s vaccine [ORGANIZATION], which is much looser than [ORGANIZATION]s  among other things, it allows for personal belief exemptions and wouldnt require kids to get vaccinated until DATE8 after federal regulators fully approve the shot for their age group. But then the [ORGANIZATION] Department of Public Health  part of [PERSON]s administration  announced [PERSON] to delay the governors mandate until [PERSON], at the earliest to ensure sufficient time for successful implementation of new vaccine requirements.

That prompted a quick response from [PERSON] Mayor PERSON3, who complained that his [PERSON] would become the only major [PERSON] city without its residents making up a majority of constituents for at least one member of ORG7. PERSON4 Please stand up for GPE6. The commission can revise problems with other districts without depriving GPE6 of voice in GPE7. The tug-of-war in response to public comment - solving one problem while trying not to create another - is part of the process, but also emblematic of the commissions struggles since adopting preliminary maps on [PERSON] and toiling on [TIME] adjustments in marathon sessions [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and [PERSON]. A message from our ORG8 The coronavirus bottom lineAs of [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] had4,909,188 confirmed cases  0.1 from DATE8 deaths  0.1 from [ORGANIZATION], according tostate data8. [ORGANIZATION] is also trackingcoronavirus hospitalizations by county9. [ORGANIZATION] has administered10 62,673,159 vaccine doses, and 70.2 of eligible [ORGANIZATION]ns are fully vaccinated11. A message from our ORG8 stories you should know 1. PERSON5 antes up on crime The windows of the ORG9 store in FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION] were boarded up as of [LOCATION]0. Videos on social media showed masked people running with goods from several high-end retailers in the storied shopping area. Photo by PERSON6  ORG10 Heading into the homestretch of [LOCATION]1, Gov. [PERSON] announced that he will include more than 350 million to combat retail theft and other crime in his budget proposal in [LOCATION]2. Some of the money will make permanent a [ORGANIZATION] Highway Patrol smash and grab enforcement unit12, which claims 300 arrests and 19 million in recovered merchandise already, and expand it from [LOCATION], [PERSON]0 and [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]1. As [ORGANIZATION] PERSON8 explains13, the takeaway from PERSON5s [ORGANIZATION] press event seemed to be While crime isnt really high historically and the smash-and-grabs at high-end boutiques are being [ORGANIZATION], the public is very concerned and the state has a huge budget surplus, so why not spend some more on anti-crime efforts? [ORGANIZATION] mean nothing in terms of your feelings. Its the most recent and clearest example of [ORGANIZATION] Democrats talking tougher on crime15 heading into the [LOCATION]3 election. Republicans in the ORG13 are not impressed. [LOCATION] ORG14 leader [PERSON] It shouldnt have taken increasing homicide rates, widespread news reports of smash-and-grabs, and pleas from [ORGANIZATION]ns for Democrats to come to this realization. 2. Will stricter [ORGANIZATION] rules backfire? The office of [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]1 on [LOCATION]4. ORG16 [PERSON]0 The rampant fraud at [ORGANIZATION] unemployment department has been a big story during the pandemic. For good reason At least 20 billion in bogus claims16, some filed from behind bars. But what if tightening the rules to stop fraud hurts [ORGANIZATION]ns who can least afford it? [PERSON]1 of the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Divide team explores that conundrum, in the context of a new policy17 that could require tens of thousands of [ORGANIZATION]ns to return their unemployment benefits because they may not have been working or looking for work. The state ORG18 began issuing notifications of the proof-of-work requirement [LOCATION]5 to about 900,000 people, one third of the recipients of a federal program that ran from [LOCATION]6 and ended in [LOCATION]7. It was aimed at those who dont usually qualify for unemployment benefits because they are freelancers or small-business owners. Under the policy, they must prove that they were working, or planning to work, prior to filing their unemployment claim. If they cant, they would be ineligible and asked to give the benefits back. That would be more than 32,000 if a recipient received full benefits for [LOCATION]8 of the program. In addition, if a claimant offered false information, the state could impose a 30 penalty. But some experts say that could force people to pay back money they dont have, and are suggesting giving recipients a pass. [PERSON]2, executive director of [ORGANIZATION] should be saying, Look, if you got unemployment insurance benefits during that time, youre fine. If the concern is fraudulent claims, then do the work to fix the administration of the system. 3. A clarification on nursing homes An item in the [LOCATION]9 newsletter18 about a [ORGANIZATION] story on nursing homes19 should have made clear that the industry association opposes tying funding only to staffing, but supports tying funding to other patient quality standards. Also, the item should have said that [PERSON] Health chairperson [PERSON]3 is the one appalled by the number of [ORGANIZATION] deaths in skilled nursing facilities.

Photo by [PERSON]8 for [ORGANIZATION] A lot happened DATE22 on the housing and homelessness beat. Heres a look back at the biggest developments, as reported by [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]4. Did the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic and the first population decline since DATE23 stop [ORGANIZATION] housing prices from rising in DATE20? Nope. The statewide median home price reached a record 800,[ZIP], more than double the national average. While potential homeowners had it rough, so did some renters. The ORG13 twice extended a statewide eviction moratorium22 that banned landlords from kicking out tenants over missed rent payments. But an investigation by [ORGANIZATION] uncovered that at least 10,000 households23 fell through that safety net and were locked out between [LOCATION]6 and March DATE20. The state received more than 5 billion in federal aid for rent relief, but the rollout for tenants and landlords was slowed for much of DATE26 by problems with language, reliable internet and public awareness25. There was some action at the state [PERSON] to increase the housing supply. The most significant move a new law that does away with the single-family zoning26 that dominates the majority of the states developable land. [PERSON]9, policy director for ORG25 at ORG26 It signals that lawmakers are willing to take on the traditional sacred cows of housing and single-family zoning. From a political standpoint, thats a pretty significant shift in the housing landscape. Meanwhile, homelessness became an even bigger issue[ORGANIZATION]4 in DATE20. In the campaign for the DATE27 recall election, the major Republican candidates hammered Gov. [PERSON]s policies as [LOCATION]. The unsheltered population has increased by 24 from DATE[ORGANIZATION]4 30to about 161,000 people in DATE29. Experts believe that number has risen during the pandemic, though the state converted motels to create about 6,000 housing units31. A study by ORG27 researchers found that nearly 1,500 people, the vast majority likely homeless, [PERSON] on the streets of [PERSON]3 between [LOCATION]6 and [DATE] DATE20, many from drug overdoses. The increase is especially discouraging after the state has spent 13 billion on homelessness since DATE[ORGANIZATION]4. A scathing state audit from [ORGANIZATION]1 points to a main culprit a lack of coordination and accountability33 across the web of state agencies and local counties, cities and service providers. Still, PERSON5 and legislators allotted another 12 billion to address homelessness34 over [ORGANIZATION]2, including 2.75 billion to buy and [PERSON], office and commercial buildings into housing and 2.2 billion for behavioral health treatment.

The legislation included approving new state legislative districts, authorizing schools to stock and use medicines to counteract an opioid overdose and requiring insurance companies to provide hearing aid coverage for children. Democrats and Republicans praised a bill that would expand the use of overdose-reversing drugs, including allowing schools to stock naloxone, which could be administered by staff trained to recognize an opioid overdose.

[ORGANIZATION]6 [PERSON] DATE93, a measure filed as it has in DATE43 by Rep. [ORGANIZATION]9, would remove laws that require a concealed-weapons permit in [ORGANIZATION]. Since the end product has yet to be marked up in committee, it is as yet unclear the extent to which the bill would allow the public display of firearms, with no restrictions, and [ORGANIZATION]7 has some reservations about unfettered open carry.

The bottom line is the American dream is slipping away for more and more people DATE45, Sen. [PERSON] said.

That includes how voters in the district cast ballots in [DATE] presidential elections and the [ORGANIZATION] gubernatorial race. In this case, the new district came out as R1, closer, actually, and its trended more purple over time.

Indeed, youth should have a prominent voice in the discussion of the bill and so should the science- and data-oriented experts who know the [STREET] of sexuality in education.

CRISIS  [ORGANIZATION] says [PERSON] [PERSON]26 is wrong to say then-Vice President had the right to overturn [DATE]8 election[ORGANIZATION]2 via [PERSON]93 and [PERSON]94 of [ORGANIZATION]41 Politics  [PERSON]25 called out his former boss by name on [DATE]3, saying that President [PERSON]26 is wrong in claiming that [PERSON]25 had the right to overturn the [DATE]8 election on [LOCATION], [DATE]. Speaking at [ORGANIZATION]00 [ORGANIZATION] Chapters conference near GPE[LOCATION]17, [PERSON]25 delivered his strongest response yet to [PERSON]26s ongoing efforts to relitigate the [DATE]8 Presidential Election, calling it un-American to suggest one person could have decided the outcome. [PERSON]25 warned against conservatives who insist that the Vice President can alter an election and said it could be a problematic position for Republicans in the next presidential contest. out On the issue of overturning the election, [ORGANIZATION] throws [PERSON] [PERSON]26 under the bus. Newly obtained records show [PERSON]26 and [PERSON]96 spoke at length on [TIME] of [LOCATION][ORGANIZATION]3 via [PERSON]97, [PERSON]98 and [PERSON]99 of [ORGANIZATION]41  The [ORGANIZATION]6 select committee investigating the FAC0 insurrection is now in possession of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6 records that provide new details about a phone call [PERSON]26 made to Rep. PERSON200 on [LOCATION], [DATE], as the investigation drills down on the former Presidents communications [LOCATION]03 and questions have long swirled around calls between him and lawmakers. Two sources reviewed call records that [PERSON]26 spoke on the phone at the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6 residence with PERSON200 for [TIME] on the [TIME] of [LOCATION]. In censure of PERSON26 and PERSON27, [ORGANIZATION]8 calls events of [LOCATION] legitimate political discourse[ORGANIZATION]4 via PERSON201 of [ORGANIZATION]41  In a resolution formally censuring [ORGANIZATION]7 Reps. PERSON202 and PERSON203, [ORGANIZATION]43 on [DATE]3 described the events surrounding the [LOCATION], [DATE] insurrection, which have been at the center of a [ORGANIZATION]6 probe, as legitimate political discourse. A copy of the resolution obtained by [ORGANIZATION]41 claimed that the two lawmakers were participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse from their perches on the [ORGANIZATION]6 select committee. A [LOCATION] suspect died. Now the [ORGANIZATION]44 has to prep for conspiracies.[ORGANIZATION]5 via PERSON204 of [ORGANIZATION]45  A man featured on the [ORGANIZATION]44s website, wanted for assaulting police at the FAC0 during the [LOCATION] attack, died [LOCATION]04. In [LOCATION]05 since the [LOCATION] investigation began, the [ORGANIZATION]44 has posted images of more than 500 individuals on its GPE7 FAC0 Violence webpage. More than [LOCATION]170 of those included on the page still havent been arrested, including dozens who have been successfully identified by online sleuths. Removing his image from the website now could spark additional conspiracy theories that could only be resolved through public identification, which would set off a fresh round of pain for a family still recovering from its loss. His removal from the list without being charged has prompted rampant conspiracy theories that he was acting as a plant to stoke the crowd.  PERSON205  This was [PERSON]4 when [PERSON]26 revealed all[ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION] via PERSON206 of The [ORGANIZATION] Post  [PERSON]26 has told some big lies over [LOCATION]05s. One of the biggest, it now is clear, came on [LOCATION]07, [PERSON] after his supporters assaulted the GPE7 FAC0. On [LOCATION], as law enforcement officers fought valiantly against an armed mob of rioters attacking the FAC0, [PERSON]26 remained in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6, silent in the face of repeated efforts by advisers, family members and allies who pleaded with him to try to call a halt to the violence. [LOCATION]08, in a videotaped address, he said, finally, that he was outraged by the heinous attack on the FAC0. He didnt mean it, as he made clear [ORGANIZATION]1end. [PERSON] [PERSON]26 has told many lies, but one stands out. The extreme ideas floating around [PERSON]26 on how to overturn the election[ORGANIZATION]7 via PERSON207 of The [ORGANIZATION] Post  As [PERSON]26 tried to hang on to power after his election loss, he surrounded himself with advisers, lawyers, and seemingly random people who were willing to give him ideas. We keep learning just how drastic some of those ideas were. The President appeared to take some more seriously than others, but it seems clear that [PERSON]26 andor his top aides at least entertained the thought of seizing voting machines. A memo was circulated among [PERSON]26 allies suggesting that the [ORGANIZATION]48 could be used to try to prove a baseless claim about fraud. And thats just whats been revealed in reporting and from the congressional [LOCATION] investigation. [PERSON]26 and allies try to redefine racism by casting [ORGANIZATION] men as victims[ORGANIZATION]8 via PERSON208 of The [ORGANIZATION] Post  Holding [STREET] at a political rally in [PERSON]6 [ORGANIZATION]1, [PERSON]26 implied that he, a wealthy [ORGANIZATION] man who was elected to an office almost exclusively held by [ORGANIZATION] men, was also a victim of racism. [PERSON]26s claim referenced what he said were three radical vicious, racist prosecutors, one in [PERSON]7, one in [PERSON]8, one in [ORGANIZATION], all of them Black, who are investigating his role in the [LOCATION] insurrection and examining his business organizations finances. But his comments made him the latest in a line of conservatives claiming, loudly and frequently, that [ORGANIZATION] men are also victims of racism. How [PERSON]26s political style smothered the last substance left in the [ORGANIZATION]7[ORGANIZATION]DATE8 via PERSON209 of The [ORGANIZATION] Post  PERSON210 [LOCATION] is not the first attempt to take a long view of how the party of PERSON211 became the party of [PERSON]26. [LOCATION] is persuasive in suggesting that the long-term transformation of [ORGANIZATION]50 is one in which a style of politics has overpowered and then suffocated any remnant of its substance. The [PERSON]26 era in American politics can feel uniquely disruptive, but PERSON212 highlights earlier episodes that, put together, leave [PERSON]26 looking like an inevitable outcome rather than an unlikely outlier. PERSON213 in exile70 via PERSON214 of the [ORGANIZATION]ian  PERSON216 [PERSON]26s world has certainly gotten smaller. Shes out of politics at the moment, out of her former executive job at the [PERSON]26 Organization, out of the womenswear brand that bore her name, out of high society in [PERSON]8, and cast out of [ORGANIZATION], too. PERSON216 never did find her footing in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6 or [PERSON] society [LOCATION] was the final rupture. Now the PERSON217 have sought refuge in [PERSON]9, a town that previously managed to stay off most peoples radar. Which was just fine with plenty of residents. PERSON213 arent only the towns most well-known inhabitants  theyre also among its most invisible. Still, [PERSON]9 hasnt completely sheltered them from the bitter political storm they helped create. The PERSON217 are laying low. Very low. PERSON218 is still at war71 via PERSON219 of [ORGANIZATION]29  [LOCATION]10 [LOCATION]11, PERSON220 spoke with [ORGANIZATION]52. Claiming that the [DATE]8 election involved probably the greatest fraud that our country has ever experienced in our history, [PERSON]2 was not going to allow [DATE]8 to happen, and so now what we have is this theft with mail-in ballots. He insisted that a legitimate counting of the ballots would have resulted in a [PERSON]26 landslide. PERSON220 was beginning to envision a military role. Its not unprecedented, PERSON220 insisted to [ORGANIZATION]53 host PERSON221 on Dec. [LOCATION]2. I mean, these people out there talking about martial law, like its something that weve never done, he said, adding, Im not calling for that. PERSON220 was, in fact, calling for sending the military to the contested states. LOCAL NOTES  Two men in [PERSON]2 stole 1[PERSON] ventilators, worth 3 million, the authorities say.72 via PERSON222 of [ORGANIZATION]29  Two men in [PERSON]2 have each been sentenced to [LOCATION]13 in prison for stealing medical ventilators bound for a [ORGANIZATION] care facility in GPE40 as part of a GPE7 aid program. The crime occurred in DATE62 [DATE]8, according to a news release issued after the sentencing of the second of the two men. The men, PERSON223 and PERSON224, stole a tractor-trailer from a parking lot in South [ORGANIZATION] that was loaded with 1[PERSON] ventilators, worth about 3 million, that were bound for [PERSON]2 International [INSTITUTION] for shipping to GPE40 by [ORGANIZATION]. low can you go? PERSON223 and PERSON224 are accused of stealing 3M in ventilators meant for [ORGANIZATION] patients. GPE41n doctors quest for political asylum remains in limbo [LOCATION]15 after escape to Central [ORGANIZATION]73 via PERSON225 of [ORGANIZATION]8  More than three [LOCATION]15 after he fled GPE41 seeking political asylum, Dr. PERSON226 is still waiting for a hearing in GPE[LOCATION]17 immigration [STREET]. PERSON227, [LOCATION]17, said he wants a judge to know that he put his oath as a doctor above government orders in [ORGANIZATION] when he treated wounded civilian protesters who sought to dismantle President [TIME] regime. A hearing for [ORGANIZATION] asylum case was set for [LOCATION]18 in GPE[LOCATION]17, then abruptly canceled because of [ORGANIZATION] concerns, his lawyer PERSON230 said. Online [STREET] records show there are no future hearings scheduled for [ORGANIZATION] case, which has been consolidated with his wife and daughters requests for asylum. Rising antisemitism in South [ORGANIZATION] and beyond fuels concern and determination in Jewish community74 via [PERSON]84 of the South [ORGANIZATION] Sun-Sentinel  Drivers on FAC15 in GPE[LOCATION]17 last [PERSON]9 were confronted with a Nazi flag displayed on an overpass, along with a banner proclaiming [ORGANIZATION]55 the Jews and listing the same website as the [LOCATION]20 flyers. The incidents are part of what Jewish community leaders and others said is a disturbing trend an increase in the number of antisemitic incidents, some violent, others aimed at instilling fear. Both locally and nationally, we have seen steady increases in antisemitism and all forms of bigotry over the past few [LOCATION]15, said PERSON231, interim regional director of [ORGANIZATION]56 in [ORGANIZATION]. [LOCATION]8 of the city GPE42 mayor talks about boom times, crime, expensive housing and water problem75 via Wayne [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION]06  Basking in GPE42 Beachs economic boom times, [LOCATION] PERSON233 declared that the state of our city [PERSON]1 is strong, our economy is sound, and our state of mind is sturdy. The mayor touted the new office buildings sprouting up in the city, talked up partnerships with the University of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] Agricultural and [ORGANIZATION], noted what he described as a drop in crime, and announced that hes increasing his goal for the construction of affordable housing units. While PERSON2[LOCATION]37 said hes proud of the citys accomplishments over [LOCATION]22, he is pushing his administration to do more. Housing, he said, is still too expensive for many. The city has been chipping away at homelessness but wants to do more on that front. [PERSON] PERSON235 face any penalty after investigation into his lies? What we know and dont know7[ORGANIZATION] via PERSON236 of the South [ORGANIZATION] Sun-Sentinel  [ORGANIZATION]3 says hell decide whether to take any action against PERSON237 after a state investigation concluded GPE44 top cop lied on numerous forms about his murder arrest and other key parts of his past. Many outcomes could take [STREET] in [LOCATION]23 The Governor soon could act to suspend PERSON237 from office. He could wait for a state ethics panel to recommend whether any discipline or penalty is warranted  and delegate that task to the ethics panel. Or he could decide to do nothing at all. PERSON237s case can be a complicated matter to decide, said attorney PERSON239. The decision to remove an elected official from office can be subjective, PERSON240 said. Legal standards, quite frankly, can be a little blurry sometimes. deep PERSON235 faces several possibilities many are not good. Image via [ORGANIZATION]02. 821[ORGANIZATION]A bad look GPE45 residents call for crackdown on teenage [DATE] [LOCATION] via PERSON242 of the Northwest [ORGANIZATION] Daily News  With [LOCATION]24 to go before the first [ORGANIZATION] crowds arrive along the beaches of [LOCATION], residents and other stakeholders are pressing county law enforcement, beach safety and code enforcement personnel to take a tough stand against teenage visitors. Clearly frustrated by what high school [DATE] breakers bring to the county, residents called for the county to institute a [DATE] break curfew and be more visible and proactive in addressing lawbreaking, particularly underage drinking. [LOCATION]25, [LOCATION] Commissioner PERSON237 [PERSON], whose district includes most of the countys 2[ORGANIZATION] miles of public and private beaches, asked for consideration of a [ORGANIZATION] curfew  TOP OPINION  PERSON244 Before any ban, [ORGANIZATION] should first look at GPE47 successful ranked choice voting78 via [ORGANIZATION] Politics  Ranked choice voting [ORGANIZATION] has a long history in GPE48 for state and county [ORGANIZATION]60 elections going back to [LOCATION]26. Starting in 201DATE8, GPE48 cities have had the option to use [ORGANIZATION] for their nonpartisan elections. [ORGANIZATION] is a faster, cheaper, and better [STREET] to run our local elections in GPE48. Traditionally, GPE47 local elections include a Preliminary Election in DATE62 to narrow down the field, and then a General Election in [LOCATION]27 between the top candidates. With [ORGANIZATION], cities can replace two elections with one  shortening the campaign [DATE] and reducing the cost to taxpayers. Instead of going to the polls twice which data shows greatly reduces turnout, voters only have to go once!  OPINIONS  [ORGANIZATION]8 should take a lesson from [PERSON]257DATE8 via [ORGANIZATION]61 editorial board  There is no conceivable political benefit to [ORGANIZATION]50 or its members, other than [PERSON]26, in looking to defend or minimize [LOCATION] rather than simply move on. The American people are never itching to hear a defense of rioters. But the voters have also shown little interest in the Democrats obsession over the event. Republicans who did nothing to encourage the mob, and there are many such Republicans, need not wear a hair shirt over [LOCATION], but when they choose to talk about it, they should tell the unsparing truth. We commend the example of [PERSON]25. [PERSON]25 gives bombshell speech that [PERSON]26 was wrong. But now comes the hard part80 via [ORGANIZATION]4 editorial board  [PERSON]25 finally, finally, finally said what needed to be said. President [PERSON]26 is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election. Well, hallelujah. Its [LOCATION]28, and its not under oath. But he said it, and to a [ORGANIZATION] gathering of [ORGANIZATION]00, a conservative legal group. If [PERSON]25 truly wants to remedy any of the damage to this country, he should now encourage other Republicans to drop the masks of falsity so many have willingly worn for [LOCATION]29, too fearful of [PERSON]26 to stop mouthing his [LOCATION]. For [PERSON]25, it might turn out that his speech was the easy part. But [PERSON]1, in this one moment, hearing a top Republican say the plain and simple truth gives us a flicker of relief, a momentary cessation of pain, like a national headache that suddenly stops hurting. Will [ORGANIZATION]s election police be afraid of ghosts? Lawmakers, dump this idea81 via [ORGANIZATION]4 editorial board  The PERSON246 ghost candidate scandal has called into question the results of one [PERSON]2 [PERSON] race and maybe two others, one in [PERSON]2 and another in GPE49, all won by Republicans. Its turning into one of the worst abuses of our election system in [LOCATION]30. That has us thinking DATE61be we were too hasty when we said [ORGANIZATION]3 proposed election security office was a waste of time and tax money. Surely this kind of potential misconduct would be its reason for existing. Nope. Sen. [PERSON], sponsor of the [PERSON] bill that would create an election security office, said [ORGANIZATION]0 that the special investigative unit that [ORGANIZATION]3 has called for would only deal with election fraud  not candidacy fraud, according to [ORGANIZATION]8. If Democrats dont ask questions, nobody [DATE] via PERSON248 of the South [ORGANIZATION] Sun-Sentinel  The [PERSON] Ethics and [ORGANIZATION] discussed a controversial and hasty 45-page rewrite of a bill that includes a scaled-back version of [ORGANIZATION]3 new elections police force [PERSON] [PERSON] [DATE]. Thats [LOCATION]-speak for stopping debate and calling for a vote so the minority Democrats cant run out the clock by asking questions. None of the five Republicans asked probing questions. Senators need to keep asking questions about those elections cops, and the potential for partisan witch hunts, and every other proposed change to voting laws. But they learned [DATE]3 they will have one less chance to do so. Fewer hearings mean fewer questions, and [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] was rerouted by the [PERSON] Presidents office to one fewer committee. Legislation poses a real risk to our states children[LOCATION]9 via Dr. [PERSON] for the [LOCATION] Democrat  There is an existential threat to children in legislation currently being considered by the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]6. If passed, [ORGANIZATION]6 [PERSON] [LOCATION]0DATE85 would codify a presumption of [DATE] timesharing between divorced parents. While this may sound fair and reasonable on its face, it is not it poses a real risk to our states children and, I believe, it must be stopped. As a regularly appointed social investigator in family law cases, I work almost exclusively with families going through a divorce and are in conflict over the timesharing of their children. So, it is with this extensive firsthand experience that I speak out against this presumption of the [DATE] timesharing provision in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]0DATE85. PERSON250 [ORGANIZATION]0s Dirty Dozen, [ORGANIZATION]7 discomfort and hypocrisy84 via [ORGANIZATION] Politics  [PERSON] hammered the 12 school districts that defied [ORGANIZATION]3 ban on mask mandates  pushing budget language to strip 200M from the Dirty Dozen and redistribute it to districts that complied. PERSON69 Schools Superintendent PERSON68 called [PERSON] a childish, immature bully. Political observers might be tempted to add another adjective Hypocrite. [PERSON] introduced legislation to require the teaching and other remembrances of the 1[PERSON]0 Ocoee [ORGANIZATION]8 Riots and the Holocaust. It passed in March [DATE]8, and [ORGANIZATION]3 happily signed it. Fast-forward [LOCATION]33, and there was [PERSON] accusing [ORGANIZATION]65 of using critical race theory CRT. What changed? How did these two go from passing and signing legislation assailing racism and antisemitism to become cheerleaders for a movement aimed at sanitizing LOC8 shameful racial history? One bills answer to corruption More secrecy85 via [ORGANIZATION]8 editorial board  There is one bill thats more dangerous than any pro-secrecy legislation weve seen in a long time. If it passes, [LOCATION] 1547[ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]378 could tunnel new and secretive channels in [ORGANIZATION]s already corrupt campaign finance system by hiding the names of big-money donors. Well, if these bills pass, lawmakers will have done something They will have made the situation much, much worse, by wrapping a cloak of secrecy around the names and other identifying information of those big-money donors. Holier-than-thou book banners in [ORGANIZATION] ought to start with the Bible8[ORGANIZATION] via PERSON252 of [ORGANIZATION]06  We may have to ban the Bible from [ORGANIZATION]s public schools. Book banning is starting to take off in [ORGANIZATION], and as long as it is, we shouldnt leave the Bible out of the discussion. A national group called The County Citizens [ORGANIZATION]1ing Freedom has formed in [ORGANIZATION]5 to remove books from [INSTITUTION] libraries deemed harmful to children under the age of [LOCATION]3. OK, so if we need to scrub the [INSTITUTION] shelves from books that promote the socialist mentality andor contain narrative accounts of sexual excitement or sexual conduct, its time to round up all the [LOCATION] and lock them away from the children. For starters, PERSON253 was basically PERSON254 in open-toed sandals. If youre into more graphic sexual passages, [ORGANIZATION] has a lot to offer.

scranton,2021-11-01T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,WILK,homeless,State renews $1.7B contract with troubled [ORGANIZATION] lab,"The automatic renewal, which [ORGANIZATION] spokesperson [ORGANIZATION] confirmed to me [ORGANIZATION] [TIME], comes as the state faces scrutiny for its failure to release a report investigating significant deficiencies at the lab. Gov. [PERSON] administration said3 the full report would be made available in [LOCATION]. DATE2, it is nowhere to be found. I urge you to halt auto-renewal of the contract, ORG1 Republican Leader [PERSON] wrote in a DATE3 letter4 to the states top health officials, arguing that it would be irresponsible to let any contract auto-renew when serious allegations remain unanswered and the report out of public reach. PERSON3 told me in a statement The state plans to continue to have ORG2 operational to ensure that we have adequate testing capabilities going into [DATE]. We will continue to evaluate our need for the laboratory as we do with all aspects of our response.The state can elect to terminate the agreement without case sic with DATE5 notice. To date, the state has paid [ORGANIZATION] 716 million to operate the laboratory, with majority of funds recovered through the federal funds and health insurance claims. The state opened FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] after giving diagnostics company [ORGANIZATION] a no-bid [ORGANIZATION] to operate it. Problems began popping up almost immediately. Whistleblowers told [PERSON] that lab techs were sleeping while processing [PERSON] samples, test swabs were found in bathrooms and staff were inadequately trained. Although the state initially disputed the extent of the problems, it later admitted8 that it had become aware of significant deficiencies in DATE8. Indeed, state health inspectors gave the lab an immediate jeopardy [PERSON]  which represents10 the most severe and egregious threat to the health and safety of recipients. Meanwhile, the lab has consistently struggled to meet its mandate11 of processing 150,000 tests a day and turning results around quickly. According to the most recent state [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] processed less than 195,000 tests for [PERSON] and returned only 40 of test results within [LOCATION]5  one of the lowest rates in the state. The lab also has a history of high rates of invalid, lost or cancelled test results. According to [PERSON], 1 out of every 42 tests processed at ORG7 as of [LOCATION]0 did not return a clear positive or negative result. [ORGANIZATION] did not respond [LOCATION]1 to questions from ORG8 about the contract renewal. PERSON3 said that more than 1,600 schools are using the lab for [PERSON]-19 testing  but that doesnt include the states largest district, [ORGANIZATION]. Former Superintendent PERSON4 told [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] that ORG10 signed a testing contract with private company [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]2  [LOCATION]3 before the state made public its contract with [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] said that each test costs the district about 12 compared to the 53 charged by [ORGANIZATION]15 during [LOCATION]4 and that the deal stipulated the district wouldnt pay anything if accuracy thresholds and [TIME] results werent met. [ORGANIZATION] data shows16 [ORGANIZATION] returns 99 of test results within [LOCATION]5. [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] Unified reviewed the [ORGANIZATION] price and terms and elected to stay with [ORGANIZATION] because the price and terms were materially better for the school district. Interestingly, the states contract with [ORGANIZATION]17 also allows it to cancel the deal if [PERSON]-19 testing has become commercially available at lower cost and [ORGANIZATION] is unable to achieve comparable cost reduction. A Message from our [LOCATION] The coronavirus bottom lineAs of [LOCATION]6, [PERSON] confirmed cases 0.2 from [LOCATION]7 0.2 from [LOCATION]8, according tostate [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] is also trackingcoronavirus hospitalizations by county19. [PERSON] has administered20 53,043,311 vaccine doses, and 73 of eligible [PERSON]ns are fully vaccinated21. A Message from our [LOCATION] stories you should know 1. PERSON6 replaces [PERSON] in [PERSON] Congresswoman PERSON8, Lt. Gov. [PERSON] and [PERSON] at FAC1 on [LOCATION]9 in [PERSON]. Photo by [PERSON]0 for [ORGANIZATION] Lt. Gov. [PERSON] will lead the [PERSON] delegation at [ORGANIZATION] that begins DATE20 in GPE4, [PERSON]  the result of [PERSON] abruptly cancelling his trip23 DATE21 and announcing that he and [ORGANIZATION] Jennifer Siebel [PERSON] would attend virtually due to family obligations. The about-face came [TIME] after I reported that details of [PERSON]s itinerary were practically nonexistent and that virtually no one from the [PERSON] press corps would be covering [PERSON]24 at the conference due to his office not telling journalists about the trip until DATE22 after the deadline to apply for a press credential. Indeed, [PERSON] had privately questioned his purpose in attending the conference and didnt have plans to make any major announcements, [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]4 reports25. The last-minute pivot is eerily similar to an episode from [LOCATION]0 2020, in which [PERSON] backed out of a prime-time speaking spot at [TIME] before his scheduled speech. Then, to cap off the whirlwind series of events, [PERSON] announced he would be giving virtual remarks after all  just moments before he appeared via a cell phone livestream. 2. [PERSON] confronts crime uptick [ORGANIZATION] via ORG16 Three indications that crime will likely be a top issue for many [PERSON] voters in the DATE24 elections [PERSON] homicide rate is already 17 higher than it was in [DATE]  when the city saw a DATE27 high of 355 killings  and a whopping 49 higher than it was in DATE28. As of DATE29, the city had logged 320 homicides  putting it on track to potentially top 400 [PERSON] for the first time since DATE30. The surge in murders has increased homicide detectives workload29, resulting in less cases being solved. Meanwhile, [PERSON] [PERSON]5 is warning30 that the countys vaccine mandate will result in a mass exodus of law enforcement officers, increasing dangers to public safety.A ORG17 grocery store in GPE7 is limiting its hours31 due to what one supervisor described as out of control shoplifting. The move comes DATE31 after ORG18 announced plans to close five GPE7 stores32 because of organized retail crime. Although police data casts doubt on that [LOCATION], the closures have fueled the perception that GPE7 is overrun by crime  and the city itself is hoping that its requirement for municipal employees to return to the office starting DATE2034 will help make downtown seem busier and safer. [PERSON]s beleaguered bullet train project has cut through disadvantaged [ORGANIZATION] communities, displacing homes, businesses and residents and fueling drug deals and crimes in certain areas, the [PERSON] Times reports35. For example, after the high-speed rail authority paid the city of GPE8 to relocate a farmworkers housing site, the vacant units turned into a crime scene. Many of the units have been set on fire. There are homeless folks there, others hiding out, doing drug deals and storing stolen goods, said city manager [PERSON]6. 3.

Some of [PERSON]s methods  like personally encouraging students with good grades to re-enroll in classes and launching a digital planner to help visualize degree paths  have been met with praise, while others  such as redesigning core classes where a higher percentage of low-income students and students of color receive Ds and Fs  are more controversial, [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]9 reports37. In other higher-education news, ORG25 is in the midst of yet another scandal. On DATE21, ORG25 President [PERSON]0 acknowledged the university waited too long38 to notify students about numerous allegations of drugging and sexual assault at ORG26 fraternity parties. ORG25 authorities on DATE35 were informed of five to seven of these incidents, but didnt notify the community until DATE36  DATE37 after yet another student reported a sexual assault at ORG26.

fayetteville,2020-02-25T00:00:00Z,Impact News Service,The Arkansas Traveler,homelessness,"EXECUTIVE SESSION; Congressional Record Vol. 166, No. [DATE] ([ORGANIZATION])","EXECUTIVE CALEND[LOCATION] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the [ORGANIZATION] will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of [ORGANIZATION], of [ORGANIZATION], to be Judge for the District [STREET] of [ORGANIZATION] for a period of ten [LOCATION]5. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] Mr. [PERSON]. [PERSON] President, I rise [LOCATION] to celebrate [ORGANIZATION] and to pay tribute to [ORGANIZATION]ns whose work has made a real difference in our GPE2. DATE2 we will honor three individuals who have dedicated themselves to uplifting the lives of others. We know that Dr. [PERSON], once said [ORGANIZATION] most persistent and urgent question is What are you doing for others?  For purposes of [DATE] remarks, I will substitute one word. I will substitute the word children for the word others and ask What are you doing for our children? It is an important question, not only for those of us who gather for [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] and to celebrate [PERSON], but it is also an important question for every Member of ORG2 to ask themselves. DATE2 we are going to honor these three [ORGANIZATION]ns PERSON3, [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON]. All three have dedicated their lives to answering this urgent question and to building pathways toward hope for children in their communities. I can think of no calling more important and no mission more essential than this one to help our children. It is an honor for me to have the privilege to recognize these remarkable [ORGANIZATION]ns. They are beacons in their communities, and they are each, in their own [STREET], an inspiration to me in my work in the [ORGANIZATION] and, I know, to the work of our staff as well. [PERSON] children face a crisis created by policy choices made by adults over DATE5. Despite low unemployment and overall economic growth, children are being left out and left behind. Almost half of young children in GPE3 live in poverty or near poverty, with infants and toddlers at greatest risk. [ORGANIZATION] S1097 Nearly half of children live in those circumstances. According to [ORGANIZATION], which takes into account many of the government programs designed to assist low-income families and individuals, childhood poverty worsened--worsened--in [ORGANIZATION] for the first time since the Great Recession. Poverty harms children both immediately and for [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] concluded in their [ORGANIZATION] seminal report, A Roadmap to Reducing Child Poverty. They found that poverty itself, especially when it occurs in early childhood or is persistent over time, is damaging to children in ways that last [ORGANIZATION]. Specifically, the report finds the following--and I am quoting [PERSON] We find overwhelming evidence . . . that . . . a child growing up in a family whose income is below the poverty line experiences worse outcomes than a child from a wealthier family in virtually every dimension, from physical and mental health, to educational attainment and labor market success, to risky behaviors and delinquency. This is a crisis of untapped potential opportunities. It is a crisis, as well, of contributions not made. When a child faces needless obstacles to becoming the person he or she might become, it is a profound tragedy that affects all of us because we are denying not just that child but also that family, that childs family, their community, and our country the contributions that child could make if we were investing in that child. Over time, corrupt forces have perverted the basic notions of freedom while creating a society that works for corporate interests rather than our childrens best interests. Freedom, as we know, is not simply the right to be left alone. Real freedom must include the opportunity--the affirmative ability--to achieve ones dreams. A country that claims to support the freedom of its people must provide opportunities to its citizens. For example, in his second inaugural address, President [PERSON] said the following We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few. We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at any time, may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each other . . . these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us. They dont make us a nation of takers they free us to take the risks that make this country great. President [PERSON] was right, and he knew then that there were and are [LOCATION] extraordinary people across the country who are working to give our children the opportunity to achieve and grow and contribute so much to our [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE] I will speak about three women who are doing this work in the GPE2 of [ORGANIZATION] first, [ORGANIZATION] of GPE5, [ORGANIZATION]. For over DATE9, [ORGANIZATION] has been a leader in South Central [ORGANIZATION]. During that time, she has held a number of critical roles in both the government sector and the nonprofit sector. She is currently the President and CEO of [LOCATION], the mission of which is to improve the health and well-being of persons living with HI[LOCATION]6IDS and members of the LGBTQ community in a culturally competent, affirming, and empowering environment. The agency provides behavioral health, primary care, case management, wellness services, [ORGANIZATION] testing and treatment, family planning, and a host of other programs. Critically, [ORGANIZATION] provides a safe haven for LGBTQ youth, and we know that significant progress has been made in advancing the rights of LGBTQ individuals. However, the progress has been uneven, and we are still falling far short, for example, in serving transgender young people, especially transgender young people of color who face disproportionally higher rates of suicide and violence. [ORGANIZATION], under [ORGANIZATION] leadership, has played an indispensable role in helping us better understand the challenges of LGBTQ adolescents and providing them with the services they need. In [LOCATION]0 [PERSON] was appointed to Governor PERSON9 [ORGANIZATION] Commission on [ORGANIZATION], the first-of-its-kind statewide commission in the [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]s work at ORG7 builds on her primary work at [ORGANIZATION], where she led efforts to address emerging community health challenges and to make sure that uninsured and underserved populations in South Central [ORGANIZATION] had the attention and the services that they needed. In this capacity, she spearheaded efforts to address bullying in our schools and our communities as a public health problem and also provided leadership on a strategy to reduce childhood obesity through school and community-based partnerships. Prior to her work at [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] spent [LOCATION]1 at ORG10 as a program officer and then director of programs and community investment, where she oversaw tens of millions of investment in community services and tuition assistance, giving hundreds of area college-bound students the opportunity to pursue higher education. Over her career, [ORGANIZATION] has heeded the call of service and lent her considerable passion and expertise in many different capacities. Whatever the role, the work has been the same putting a spotlight on the needs of the underserved populations--LGBTQ youth, girls of color, and other underserved populations who lack access to healthcare, higher education--and always--always--helping them to obtain the services they need and to remove the obstacles that stand between them and their full potential. Service has always been a part of [PERSON]s work, believing, as she does, that we are given resources and influence not for ourselves but for others. Also, like [ORGANIZATION], Dr. [PERSON]1 career has been defined by her service to others and to the children and young people of [ORGANIZATION]. In this case, in Southwestern [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]2 came to this work naturally, having had those values instilled in her by her late mother, the former police commander of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]3. We have had South Central [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION]. Now we are in Southwestern [ORGANIZATION] with Dr. [PERSON]2 PERSONDATE33. [PERSON]2s mom, [PERSON]6, the late police commander, was herself a trailblazer and someone whose story also should be told. We dont have time for two stories in one family [LOCATION], but I will tell part of [PERSON]6s story as well. [PERSON]6 was one of the first African-[PERSON] women officers in the [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION], joining the department in [LOCATION]2 and eventually rising to the rank of commander. In [LOCATION]3, [PERSON]6 founded [PERSON]6s Girls, an organization dedicated to empowering girls and young women through holistic, gender-specific programs, education, and experiences through after school--school and community-based programming throughout the communities in Southwestern [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]6s Girls has grown to provide service throughout the region with sites in [ORGANIZATION], GPE7, and GPE8, GPE9. Given her mothers leadership, it is no surprise that Dr. [PERSON]2 PERSONDATE33 has demonstrated the same commitment to and passion for leadership, development, and empowerment of girls. Prior to accepting the position of CEO of [PERSON]6s Girls in [LOCATION]4, [PERSON]2 spent [LOCATION]5 providing leadership in social service, community, and individual mental health treatment. [PERSON]2 began her career as a victim advocate at ORG13, working mostly in the juvenile justice space. She also remains a practicing psychiatric nurse practitioner. In that capacity, she provides psychiatric evaluations, medication management, and clinical consultation services and treatment at the [LOCATION]6 of [ORGANIZATION]--their outpatient mental health clinic. Dr. PERSONDATE33 completed dual masters degrees in nursing and social work from the University of [ORGANIZATION] and earned a doctor of nursing practice degree from ORG16 in [LOCATION]6. Through Dr. [PERSON] leadership, [PERSON]6s Girls has become recognized as a frontrunner in the integration of evidence-based, clinical prevention and intervention policies and practices that enhance the child and social welfare system. [ORGANIZATION] S1098 [PERSON]6s Girls convenes an [LOCATION]7 equity summit for Black girls to address the racial and gender biases that exist within the juvenile justice, health and wellness, child welfare, and education systems. Dr. PERSONDATE33 has also remained a constant leading force and convener of ORG17--a collaboration of over 75 stakeholders committed to addressing systemic inequities in the juvenile justice, child welfare, education, and healthcare systems. Dr. PERSONDATE33 currently serves on the board of trustees at ORG16. In [DATE] [ORGANIZATION], she was appointed by Mayor [PERSON]0 to serve as a commissioner on the newly formed ORGDATE33 for the City of [ORGANIZATION]. Our third honoree [LOCATION], Dr. [PERSON], though she was born in [ORGANIZATION]1, we are proud to call her a daughter of [ORGANIZATION]. Many in [ORGANIZATION]2 know her as a member and a leader at ORG19, as well as the partner, in both life and ministry, of Dr. PERSONDATE34, senior pastor of ORG19. [PERSON] earned a bachelor of special education from [LOCATION], a master of education in curriculum, instruction, and technology in education, and a doctor of education and curriculum, instruction, and technology in education, with an emphasis on literary education, from ORGDATE34. Dr. [PERSON]2 has devoted her passion and her time to promoting womens education and empowerment. She has especially devoted much of her time to combating human trafficking, both here in [ORGANIZATION]3 and internationally. She is an active member of the [ORGANIZATION]2 Anti-Human Trafficking Coalition and serves as cochair of the religion subcommittee. In [LOCATION]9, Dr. [PERSON]2 founded ORG23, an anti-human trafficking ministry at ORG24. ORG23 works to ensure that the faith community in Greater [ORGANIZATION]2 is aware of the issue of human trafficking and also partners with the Greater [ORGANIZATION]2 Salvation Army on the issue of participating in [STREET] outreach, supporting and strengthening the drop-in centers, and advocating on behalf of victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. In [DATE] of [LOCATION]4, under Dr. [PERSON]2s leadership, the ministry hosted its [ORGANIZATION] to raise funds for a transitional residential program for young women exiting the life and aging out of the child welfare system. Internationally, Dr. [PERSON]2 regularly participates in rescue and restoration efforts in [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6. Dr. [PERSON]2 also serves on a number of boards and provides community leadership in other ways. She is a member of the board of ORG26 in [ORGANIZATION]2, on the advisory committee of ORG27, ORG28 [LOCATION]7 luncheon, and is president of [ORGANIZATION], which is the philanthropic [PERSON]2 family foundation established to positively impact the lives of individuals by sowing financial seeds into organizations that change lives through their missions. Dr. [PERSON]2 has served on [PERSON]0 of the Community College of [ORGANIZATION]2 since [LOCATION]6 and currently serves as the president of [PERSON]0. Each of our honorees [LOCATION]--these three remarkable women--have worked tirelessly to ensure that our children can flourish and can fulfill their potential. When others may look the other [STREET] or even wash their hands of the solemn duty to help our children, our honorees have instead volunteered for service over and over again. To refer back to the first question I started with, What are you doing for our children, each of us has an obligation to answer that question. Each of our three honorees [LOCATION] have answered that question by devoting their lives to the urgent work of helping our children. These three remarkable women--all [ORGANIZATION]ns--have provided pathways to hope. For that, we owe them our deepest gratitude. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]4. [PERSON] President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [ORGANIZATION] Mr. [PERSON]4. [PERSON] President, DATEDATE34, the [ORGANIZATION] will vote on two bills that will protect our most vulnerable citizens--literally, our babies. The first bill we will vote on is [ORGANIZATION], which was introduced by our colleague from [ORGANIZATION]7, Senator [PERSON]5. This legislation is simple and straightforward. It requires physicians and healthcare providers to treat babies who survive an abortion with the same lifesaving care that other infants born at the same stage receive. While you might be forgiven for wondering, why would we need such a bill surely, that standard must already exist in our law--unfortunately, no. There are no [PERSON]6 laws requiring healthcare providers to care for abortion survivors, just as they would for any other infant in their care. One of the most notorious reasons why we need this law sits in the [PERSON]2 mansion in GPEDATE33. DATE22, our country was shocked and outraged by comments made by Gov. [PERSON]6--a pediatrician, believe it or not--about what should happen when a baby is delivered and survives an abortion. He said The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if thats what the mother and family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother. Rather than immediately doing everything possible to save the baby, to provide the same sort of care he would to any infant, he wants to sit around and decide whether the baby will live or die. That is not healthcare that is infanticide. Voting for [ORGANIZATION] is how each Member of this [PERSON]3 can go on record to say they are against killing innocent babies. While some are desperately trying to paint this as an anti-abortion bill, which would infringe on womens reproductive rights, those claims could not be further from the truth. There is nothing in this bill about limiting access to abortion, no mention of first, second, or third trimester abortions, nothing about overturning Roe v. Wade. There is one goal with this legislation and one goal only to give every baby a fighting chance. In a rational world, we wouldnt be having this discussion but would, rather, unanimously be condemning this practice for the evil that it is. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill and, once again, vote to stop the practice of infanticide and protect babies who survive abortions alive. We will be voting on a second bill, which will provide protections for unborn children that are practiced in almost all of the civilized world. This is the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act that would make it a crime for doctors to perform abortions on unborn babies at or beyond DATE23. There is significant medical research that shows that unborn children at this stage experience pain. At DATE24 into a pregnancy, these babies are beyond halfway to delivery. One of Presidents [PERSON]7 guests at the [PERSON]5 of the Union DATE25 was DATE26 [PERSON]8--one of the youngest babies to survive in [ORGANIZATION]3. [PERSON]9 was born at DATE27 DATE28 beyond the point in time we are discussing. She weighed less than a pound at birth and is living proof of the medical achievements and advancements that have improved the chance of survival for extremely premature babies. [PERSON]9 and her mother PERSON30 are an example of the impact this legislation would have on the lives of many [PERSON]s families. Unfortunately, just as our Democratic colleagues have tried to deceive the [PERSON] people about the purpose of [ORGANIZATION], they are trying to mislead everyone about what this bill would do as well. First, this bill would apply only to elective abortions, not those involving rape or incest or where the life of the mother could be in danger. It in no [STREET] places the mother in legal jeopardy for seeking an abortion. It clearly and solely places responsibility on healthcare providers. [ORGANIZATION] S1099 Passing this legislation wouldnt make [ORGANIZATION]3 an extreme outlier when it comes to abortion practices. In fact, it would put us in line with international norms. Currently, only seven countries in the world allow elective abortions after DATE23. One, of course, is [ORGANIZATION]3. The other countries on the list should make all of us second-guess allowing abortions beyond DATE23--[ORGANIZATION]9, GPE20, GPEDATE34. Countries with a history of human rights violations are hardly the model we should aspire to. It is time to give every baby a chance to live and stop doctors from performing abortions on infants who feel pain. I am proud to be a cosponsor of both of these bills and stand with my colleagues in the fight for human life. Our friend from [LOCATION], Senator PERSON31, established the first-ever [ORGANIZATION] Pro-Life Caucus to fight for the lives of our most vulnerable citizens. DATE29, he said These back-to-back votes will present an opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] Democrats and all of us to show the [PERSON] people whether there are any limits at all to radical abortion extremism. We will soon learn the answer. I appreciate our colleagues--Senator [PERSON]5, Senator [PERSON], and Senator PERSON31--for their leadership on this legislation and for consistently fighting for the most vulnerable among us. I will be a proud yes vote on both of these bills--yes to protecting newborn babies, yes to equal medical care for all infants, and yes to a fighting chance for all babies. Coronavirus [PERSON] President, we are returning to GPE23, from time spent in our GPE24. I was happy, for one, to get time to spend in GPE25 with constituents. I traveled the [PERSON]5, as I am sure many of us did, traveling from [DATE], to GPE27, to GPE28, and a number of spots in between. GPE25 is a pretty big [STREET], so it takes a little time to move around, but it is really great to be able to hear from the folks I represent--the folks we all represent--about what they care about the most. One of the most interesting things to me is how little they talk about what is talked about inside the bubble here known as GPE23. In GPE29, for example, I met with [PERSON]5 and local officials to discuss their growing concerns over coronavirus. FAC0 is one of the designated locations where [PERSON]s evacuated from overseas with suspected exposure to coronavirus are being held under the first [PERSON]6 quarantine in more than 50 [LOCATION]5. Folks were naturally concerned about the fact that these evacuees were scheduled to be transported to local civilian hospitals for testing rather than remaining on the base where they are quarantined. In our meeting, we were able to speak with not only the mayor and two council persons, but we were able to speak with officials from [PERSON]7 and [PERSON]8 about these concerns, and I am glad we were able to come up with a better solution. [PERSON]9 has now updated their protocol to ensure that testing for coronavirus will be conducted at FAC1 quarantine housing, so evacuees will not be sent to hospitals in the area for their tests. I appreciate my colleagues at the city who have been working overtime to keep their residents there safe. I am grateful to the administration for addressing our concerns and being responsive to those questions. On [DATE] we met, 90 evacuees were released from quarantine, and I am happy they are finally headed home. I am sure I am not as happy as they are after being quarantined. We owe a huge thank-you to the medical professionals who have and will continue to care for those in quarantine and to the [PERSON] and GPE29 officials who are working to safeguard public health. Prescription Drug Costs [PERSON] President, I traveled up FAC2 and was in GPE27 at the [LOCATION]0 to hear about an entirely different healthcare challenge, which is high prescription drug costs. I met with local healthcare professionals, advocates, and patients to hear about their experiences with these rising costs, and I have introduced legislation to address them. For example, we heard from PERSON33 and his daughter PERSON34, who both have diabetes. They need insulin. They told me that one bottle of insulin costs upwards of 281. PERSON35 continues to make sacrifices to afford the lifesaving drugs he and PERSON34 need to lead healthy lives. As I mentioned, to address the high costs of prescription drugs, I introduced a bipartisan bill with our colleague, Senator [PERSON] from GPE31, called [ORGANIZATION]. The purpose of the bill is straight forward to stop drug companies from gaming the patent system to keep their profits high. Patents, of course, are granted for scientific innovations in order to encourage more of them. What happens under the period of a patent is that whatever the item is--in this case, a drug--that company reserves the right to sell it exclusively, without any competition, in order to recoup its costs and incentivize innovation when it comes to these drugs. But when companies game the system by establishing patent thickets--multiple patents used to unfairly block competition--this prevents new drugs, as well as competing drugs at a lower price, from entering the market. For example, the most widely prescribed drug in GPE32 is called [ORGANIZATION]. It has more than 120 different patents, for no real purpose other than extending that period of exclusivity as long as possible to continue to make money. In LOC2, there are five competing products, but in GPE32, there is only [ORGANIZATION]. That is a patent thicket. That is gaming the system, and it is hurting [PERSON] consumers. I appreciate the support from healthcare providers and advocates and patients I heard from in GPE27. They encourage us to get our work done sooner rather than later. I have come to the floor twice and asked unanimous consent to pass the bill. It was voted unanimously out of [LOCATION]1. The Democratic leader blocked it both times. I hope he will reconsider his position. I am sure his constituents in [ORGANIZATION] would like a little bit of a break when it comes to prescription drug costs. I happen to think it has to do more with the upcoming election than it does the merits of the legislation. E-Cigarettes [PERSON] President, I traveled to a couple of other GPE25 cities, where I was able to talk to people about the rise of e-cigarette use, particularly among teens. In GPE28 along [LOCATION] and in GPE34 in deep [ORGANIZATION], I met with a range of local officials, health professionals, and community advocates about the impact of teen vaping. One study found that in [ORGANIZATION], in the middle of the GPE34 area, about half of high school students used e-cigarettes and 25 percent of them had vaped in DATE31. This study found that in schools, the average age of first-time e-cigarette users is just 13 [LOCATION]5 old. E-cigarettes--even the closed systems, where you cant add other ingredients, like the psychoactive ingredient in [LOCATION], THC-- even in the closed systems that are designed to deliver only nicotine, nicotine is an addictive drug. When children get access to these addictive drugs, it may well end up being a gateway to other use-- whether it is tobacco or other drug use--later in life. It certainly encourages them to remain a user of this nicotine delivery device. I have introduced legislation called the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act, which would make it difficult for children to get their hands on these devices, particularly when they buy them over the internet. All it does is apply the same safeguards already in [STREET] for online purchases of tobacco--it applies that to e- cigarettes. Customers would have to verify their age at the time of delivery--a practice which, shockingly, does not currently exist. A recent survey published in the [PERSON] Journal of Health Promotion found that 32 percent of underage e-cigarette users reported purchasing products online, making online sales the single largest source of purchases for underage users. We recently raised the age from DATE33 to DATE34 to get access to these e-cigarettes, but still, as these studies [ORGANIZATION] S1100 indicate, use of e-cigarettes and vaping devices is epidemic in our middle schools and our high schools. It is dangerous to the physical and mental health of our children. That is something you would think we would be able to address. If we are going to turn the tide on e- cigarettes and prevent more young people from facing their deadly health consequences, passage of this legislation is a necessary first step. [PERSON]5 Work Period [PERSON] President, when I was home in GPE29, I was able to help celebrate the investiture of one of our newest [PERSON]6 judges, PERSON37, who filled the vacancy in LOC5 of GPE25. Then I got to spend a little time in [DATE] with folks and talk about the importance of our oil and gas industry and why innovation in that space and concern about conservation and the environment were not mutually exclusive. At each step along the [STREET], I was able to hear from countless other Texans about changes they would like to see coming out of GPE35. They encouraged us to try to work together and avoid some of the partisan gridlock we have seen that characterized so much of the recent impeachment proceedings. It was DATE35 recharging at home. I came back ready to get back to work. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]. [PERSON] President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Veterans Mr. [PERSON]. [PERSON] President, the Disabled [PERSON] Veterans is celebrating 100 [LOCATION]5 of helping military veterans, and I rise to recognize this remarkable occasion. Throughout its history, the [LOCATION]4 has been influential in identifying ways to best support our veterans--from pushing for the consolidation of veterans programs, in its early [LOCATION]5, to direct outreach to veterans in communities with the launch of [LOCATION]5, to pressing for more funding for [LOCATION]6 healthcare and benefits. There has been so much progress in advancing veterans services thanks to the [LOCATION]4s efforts. The organizations members and partners have a lot to be proud of. [LOCATION]4 members have been leading advocates for injured and ill veterans and their families, which has made a difference for countless wounded warriors. The [LOCATION]4s advocacy has helped and continues to build better lives for disabled veterans. We are thankful for the more than 1 million [LOCATION]4 members and auxiliary members who are doing great work to ensure our country keeps the promise we made to the men and women who have served in uniform. DATE37, members of the [LOCATION]4 Department of [LOCATION] are visiting [LOCATION] to share the organizations legislative priorities for DATE38. They are part of an extensive network that has been influential in identifying how [LOCATION]9 can strengthen its services. They are among the [LOCATION]4 members from across the country who are in GPE23, to advocate on behalf of veterans. There is simply no substitute for coming to our ORG61 Capital and visiting with Members of ORG2 to let them know of [LOCATION]4s priorities. These include strengthening veterans mental healthcare and suicide prevention programs, improving benefits and services for women veterans and ensuring veterans who have been exposed to toxic substances receive full and timely benefits. The good news is we are working on these priorities because we all agree that our veterans deserve nothing less than quality care and the benefits they have earned. [PERSON], the [ORGANIZATION]s Committee on [ORGANIZATION] advanced the Commander PERSON39 [ORGANIZATION]. This comprehensive legislation will strengthen our ability to provide veterans with the mental healthcare they need. It includes language Senator [ORGANIZATION]0 and I authored to leverage the services of veteran-serving nonprofits and other community networks in our overall strategy to reduce veteran suicides. [LOCATION]6 Ranking Member [ORGANIZATION]1 and I are also working to improve services to our women veterans. Our [PERSON] legislation would eliminate barriers to care and services that many women veterans face and would help to ensure the [LOCATION]6 could address the needs for women, which is so critical because they are more likely to face homelessness, unemployment, and to go without needed healthcare. We are pleased to have the support of the [LOCATION]4 for this important legislation. I am proud to cosponsor the Veterans Burn Pit Exposure Recognition Act, which would allow veterans who suffer from the effects of burn pits to get the benefits and services they have earned. I encourage my colleagues to support these bills so we can provide the resources that have been promised to our veterans. For [LOCATION]5, the [LOCATION]4 members have supported the passage of the [ORGANIZATION]1 bill. Thanks, in part, to their advocacy, ORG2 approved this critical legislation [PERSON]0 that extends benefits to more veterans who were exposed to toxic chemicals during the GPE20 war. The [LOCATION]4s attention extends beyond [ORGANIZATION]. Its [ORGANIZATION]2 helps to direct services to veterans across the country. I applaud the efforts of the more than 11,000 [LOCATION]4 members in [LOCATION] whose outreach is helping veterans to understand and access their benefits. They have spent countless hours in advising fellow veterans about the assistance they qualify for and in helping them fill out the paperwork to secure those benefits through the [LOCATION]6. One of the well-known services provided by the [LOCATION]4 is the transportation of veterans to [LOCATION]6 medical centers and hospitals. In rural GPE24 like [LOCATION], the services these volunteers offer is critical to meeting veterans healthcare needs. The [LOCATION] fleet is made up of 16 vans. [PERSON]1, more than 6,600 veterans were driven to medical appointments with the help of volunteers who logged [TIME] behind the wheel. I look forward to continuing to work with [LOCATION]4 members as ORG2 crafts and reforms policies to improve services for veterans and their families. This country made a promise to our veterans that we must live up to, and I am proud to join with the [LOCATION]4 to ensure we follow through on that commitment. In working together, we can find solutions and take action to deliver the results veterans have earned and expect. We will continue looking to the [LOCATION]4 to understand how we can improve the lives of the men and women who have served in uniform. As a member of the [ORGANIZATION] Committee on [ORGANIZATION] and as chairman of the [ORGANIZATION] Appropriations subcommittee that oversees [LOCATION]6 funding, I have seen the dedication of the [LOCATION]4 to support disabled veterans in [LOCATION] and across the country. I am proud to recognize the [LOCATION]4 on its 100 [LOCATION]5 of engaging veterans, in its advocating to advance benefits, services, and care, and in its making a positive difference in the lives of veterans and their families. Remembering [ORGANIZATION]2 [PERSON] President, on a separate subject, I also pay tribute to an [LOCATION] veteran who is one of the GPE24 most famous sons--literary icon [ORGANIZATION]2. Mr. [ORGANIZATION]3, the author best known for his [PERSON]3 [PERSON]ern novel True Grit, passed away on [DATE], DATE38. Born in [PERSON]5, in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]3 spent his childhood in southern [LOCATION]. He enlisted in [ORGANIZATION]5 and served as an infantryman and, during the Korean war, reached the rank of sergeant before his discharge in [PERSON]6. Following his military service, he attended the University of [LOCATION] and wrote for the student newspaper, the [LOCATION] [PERSON]. He graduated from the university in [PERSON]7 with a degree in journalism. After graduating, [ORGANIZATION]3 began his career as a reporter. He first worked at the [LOCATION] [PERSON] and then at the [ORGANIZATION] Herald Tribune. Though he voluntarily ended his journalism career in [PERSON]8, he used the skills and tools he had acquired as a reporter when he returned home to [LOCATION] to begin writing fiction. His most celebrated work is the [PERSON]ern classic True Grit. This book chronicles the efforts of a GPE40 [ORGANIZATION] S1101 teenager, [ORGANIZATION]4, along with GPE41 Marshal [ORGANIZATION]5, to avenge the death of [ORGANIZATION]6 father at the hands of a drifter. The novel incorporates distinct references that are familiar to many Arkansans, and it depicts life on the frontier in what was then the wild, wild [PERSON]. It was later adapted into film in [PERSON]9 and DATE50. While it is his most well-known work, Mr. [ORGANIZATION]3 also wrote four other novels and several shorter works of fiction and nonfiction. During his career, [ORGANIZATION]3 was honored with the [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]s first [ORGANIZATION] in Southern Literature award and was presented with [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] Award. True Grit has been praised as one of the great [PERSON] novels. I take this opportunity to say how proud we are of [ORGANIZATION]2 and his legacy as an acclaimed writer and storyteller. My thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family as they remember and reflect on his life. I hope they find comfort in the fact that Mr. [ORGANIZATION]3 has left a profound, lasting mark on [LOCATION], as well as within our ORG61 culture and literary traditions. [ORGANIZATION]2 had a remarkable career that will be remembered for a long time to come. I wish to honor him and his loved ones [LOCATION] and help to celebrate his life. On behalf of all Arkansans, we celebrate [ORGANIZATION]2 and his notable contributions to our [PERSON]5. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [LOCATION]. Mr. [ORGANIZATION]7. [PERSON] President, I am pleased to have arrived on the [ORGANIZATION] floor just a bit early to have heard the Senator from [LOCATION], Mr. [ORGANIZATION]8, pay tribute to the [LOCATION]4, Disabled [PERSON] Veterans, and I very much want to join in his comments. I will also take a moment to thank him for his continual service for veterans, not only for those of [LOCATION] but of our [ORGANIZATION], and to recognize that he and I, since DATE51 in ORG63, have worked together on veterans issues and both now find ourselves in positions in the hopes that we can do even more. To Senator [ORGANIZATION]8, I say thank you for his continued efforts in making sure that all who serve our [ORGANIZATION] have a better future and that [LOCATION]9, as well as the [PERSON] people, do everything they can to make sure that what they are entitled to they will receive. So I thank the Senator from [LOCATION]. Tribute to [ORGANIZATION]9 [PERSON] President, I come to the floor to congratulate and pay tribute to a [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]9. He is retiring as the President of the [LOCATION] Association of Broadcasters. He has spent the last 40 [LOCATION]5 in the broadcast business and DATE53 at the ORG65 in his advocating on behalf of broadcasters across our [PERSON]5. His dedication to making certain that rural communities in [LOCATION] have access to quality broadcasting programming is a testament to his commitment to rural GPE32 at large. I, in particular, find that very pleasing as we know how important broadcasting is--local broadcasting in particular--to the future and well-being of the citizens of [LOCATION] and, particularly, to those who live in our smallest communities. [PERSON]0 is widely recognized as one of the most knowledgeable and effective advocates for broadcasting in our [PERSON]5 and around the country. He has been a leading voice in GPE43 and GPE23, and is someone whom I hold in high regard. [PERSON]0 is a native of GPE43 who dedicated his life to broadcasting at [DATE]. With dreams of becoming a sportscaster, [PERSON]0 attended the University of [LOCATION], where he earned a degree in journalism. He later attended ORG67. After joining his hometown station, [PERSON], as an intern, [PERSON]0 worked his [STREET] up through the ranks to become a news reporter, anchor, and, eventually, an assistant news director. He also spent time at ORG69 in [LOCATION] City and later returned to [PERSON]. He left the station in DATE54 and turned his attention to sales. He served as executive director of the [LOCATION] Manufactured Housing Institute, but he could not keep his passions in the background. He left that job to return to broadcasting. Four [LOCATION]5 after leaving [PERSON], he rejoined the station at which he would ultimately be named program director and operations manager. He later took over as general manager of ORG71, in GPE43, and eventually moved to GPE46 to manage two television stations. After having spent DATE56 running broadcast stations that [PERSON]s from all over our [PERSON]5 have relied on for both local and national news, he became the president and executive director of the [LOCATION] Association of Broadcasters in DATE57. [PERSON]0 has had a long and successful career. He has earned esteemed awards, including [ORGANIZATION] from the University of [LOCATION]. He has also served in numerous leadership capacities, including as the former president of the [ORGANIZATION]al Alliance of [PERSON]5 Broadcasters Associations and as the former chairman of the Greater GPE43 [PERSON]3 of Commerce and of [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]0 has been a powerful voice in [LOCATION] for critical [PERSON]6 policy, all framed in the larger lens of improving communities access--peoples access--to quality broadcasting. Like the rest of us from rural GPE24 like [LOCATION], [PERSON]0 knows how quickly these communities can be forgotten and has always been determined to ensure access to local information, news, and weather. I am proud to call [PERSON]0 a friend, and I look forward to seeing where his life now takes him. We meet many people in the business that we are in here in the GPE41 [ORGANIZATION] and in politics in general. [PERSON]0 is one of those whom you appreciate from DATE58 you become acquainted with him. He is straightforward and honest and tells it like it is. He is there to be supportive but is there to provide the necessary information for me and others to make the best decisions, not just on behalf of broadcasters but for those they serve in their communities. I add my voice to the well-deserved praise that he has received and will continue to receive. Congratulations and thank you to [PERSON]0 for all his work. On behalf of [LOCATION] broadcasters, you are highly regarded by them and their listeners. Your efforts have benefited [PERSON]s and have improved our [ORGANIZATION]. You will be missed at the [LOCATION] Association of Broadcasters, but I have no doubt you will continue to make your community a better [STREET]. I look forward to many more [LOCATION]5 of friendship and working together on behalf of [PERSON]s, and I thank you for your friendship and for all you have done to make our [PERSON]5 a better [STREET]. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [ORGANIZATION]8. The Senator from [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] Mr. [PERSON]1. Mr. President, DATEDATE34 the [ORGANIZATION] has another chance to vote on basic pro-life protections for babies, both born and unborn. DATE37 we have another choice to live up to our ORG61 highest principle--that every person has the right to life--or to stoop down to a narrow vision of humanity peddled by the abortion industry and its cronies. The first bill we are considering--the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act--would prohibit abortions after DATE23 of pregnancy, when there is clear, scientific evidence that these young babies can feel pain in their mothers womb. The abortion lobby and all of its defenders will dispute this science, claiming that babies or fetuses--which is the euphemism they like to use for babies--cant feel pain at all or at least until the very latest stages of pregnancy. Anyone pedaling that myth must have never visited a neonatal intensive care unit, or the [ORGANIZATION], as they are usually called. Ask any one of those [ORGANIZATION] nurses who cares for little preemies, even micro-preemies, and they will tell you how they can hold that small infant sometimes even in the palm of their hands, and they can see it grimace at a poke or a prod, maybe even slap away a tube or a needle as they approach--just as older kids do, just as some grownups do. The undeniable fact of fetal pain in these young babies influences every aspect of how we care for the young in our hospitals. We swaddle them with only the softest fabrics because their little bodies are so easily stimulated. We give them pain medicine during surgery, whether they are in the womb [ORGANIZATION] S1102 or outside it. But we offer no such comfort during abortions, even in the latest stages of pregnancy, when abortionists crush a babys skull and dismember it. Indeed, a scientific paper published [ORGANIZATION]0 in [ORGANIZATION] noted a curious fact [ORGANIZATION] is the only--the only--invasive procedure performed on unborn infants without pain medication. Then again, abortion is unusual in so many ways, as so few hospital procedures are designed to end a life, not to save a life. Are we comfortable with this state of affairs? Are we comfortable with the fact that more than 11,000 abortions were performed after [DATE] when, again, we have clear, scientific evidence that these babies feel pain and that many of them could survive outside their mothers womb? I would suggest the [PERSON] people are not comfortable with this situation, and we can do something about it in the GPE41 [ORGANIZATION] DATEDATE34. The second bill we are voting on, called [ORGANIZATION], is even more modest but perhaps even more urgent. This bill would simply protect babies when they are born alive during an abortion. I know it is amazing to even hear this, but there are rare and horrible cases in which babies are intended to be aborted, yet they are born alive, and the doctors are under no obligation to provide medical care for that young baby with a spark of God living in its soul. So this bill would simply obligate abortionists to render lifesaving medical care to a baby struggling for life on the operating table. It would require abortionists to act as those babies friends and their doctors, consistent with their oath--not act like the babys mortal enemy. Of course, the abortion lobby will tell you Oh, this never occurs. All of their defenders in the media will say that it never occurs. But if you are being honest, the facts are, they do occur. The implication here is clear. They simply want us to look away from this horror. That doesnt mean we should, though, because, in fact, we do know--we do know--that babies can survive abortions. We have the numbers to prove it from a handful of GPE24 that require abortionists to confess when they fail to kill a baby in the mothers womb and, instead, murder it on the operating table. In GPE47, 11 babies were born alive during abortions in [ORGANIZATION] another 6 were reportedly born alive in [LOCATION]0 and another 2, [PERSON]0. There were 19 precious little babies born alive during abortions in just 1 [PERSON]5 in just 3 [LOCATION]5. Other GPE24 have reported dozens more cases. Still, the abortion industry will dismiss these lives as a mere rounding error Lets not even focus on it. It is not a serious matter. But forgive us if most [PERSON]s see the matter differently. These are precious little children, made in the image of God and endowed by him with the same worth and dignity as you and me and all of us. We have a duty to these little children. We have a duty not to look away from them. These pro-life bills are modest and humane. They have the strong support of the [PERSON] people--clear majorities. But the real reason we must protect these babies is not because it is popular but because it is right. Every human being is created equal and deserves recognition and protection under our laws. It says so right in the preamble to our Declaration of Independence. Our country doesnt always live up to that noble principle. But right now we have an opportunity to live up to it just a little bit more, if only in just a few more cases--but those cases in which life is most vulnerable and most innocent. So I urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity and protect life by acknowledging the humanity of these precious little children. We must not look away any longer. I yield the floor. Recognition of the Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Coronavirus Mr. [PERSON]2. Mr. President, well, ORG77 has now reported that there are 79,000 cases of coronavirus across at least 30 countries, with at least 53 confirmed cases here in [LOCATION]. As the virus continues to spread, the global economy is already beginning to suffer. All of the warning lights are flashing bright red. We are staring down a potential pandemic, and the administration has no plan. We have a crisis of coronavirus, and President [PERSON]3 has no plan, no urgency, no understanding of the facts or how to coordinate a response. We must get a handle on the coronavirus and make sure [ORGANIZATION]3 is fully prepared to deal with its potentially far-reaching consequences, but the [PERSON]3 administration has been asleep at the wheel. President [PERSON]3, good morning. There is a pandemic of coronavirus. Where are you? Where is your plan? It is just amazing. As the crisis grows and grows, we hear nothing. Coronavirus testing kits have not been widely distributed to our hospitals and public health labs. President [PERSON]7 [PERSON]5 Department overruled the recommendations of the scientists in the CGPE44 and allowed infected passengers from a cruise ship to be flown back into [ORGANIZATION]3. Amazingly, at a time when we know that these pandemics can spread, this administration cut the CGPE44--the agency in charge of fighting these global viruses--with a 16-percent senseless cut to its budget. My fellow [PERSON]s, that is what they do on all these things. They just cut, and then the President tries to claim credit after we restore the money. He did it in his [PERSON]5 of the Union. He was claiming, because of his great work with [ORGANIZATION]0, we are curing cancer. He has cut the [ORGANIZATION]0 every budget, including this one. It is a disgrace how this man can say one thing and do another and confounding that it doesnt catch up with him with too many [PERSON]s and none of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and it is probably, right now, most dangerous and most egregious when it comes to coronavirus. It wasnt just that the President cut CGPE44 [PERSON]0. It follows [LOCATION]5 of drastic cuts to the global health division at CGPE44 by the [PERSON]3 administration. In [LOCATION]0, CGPE44 was forced to reduce the numbers of countries it operated in from 49 to 10. That is how bad it is. We have crises, and we have a world that is different, and this administration, instead of stepping up to the plate, runs away, listening to the clarion call of the far right Just cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, no matter how it affects people. In [LOCATION]0, even worse, President [PERSON]3 ordered [ORGANIZATION]1 to scupper its entire global health security unit and asked [ORGANIZATION]2 to do the same. We dont have epidemic teams in [ORGANIZATION]1 or [ORGANIZATION]3. I hope and pray to God that corona doesnt spread here, but if it does, we have been inadequately prepared because of President [PERSON]7 lack of leadership, lack of understanding science, lack of ability to listen to experts and do something about them instead of being concerned--it seems all the time--with his own ego. The President has not even taken the simple, sensible step of designating a single official to lead response efforts. In [LOCATION]6, President [PERSON] made the smart decision to appoint [PERSON]4 to lead an interagency response to the Ebola outbreak. But President [PERSON]3, in contrast, has hollowed out so many agencies that one of the key figures responding to coronavirus is [PERSON]5, an immigrant hard-liner with no experience in public health. Unbelievable. A man totally unprepared for coronavirus, an ideologue--a rightwing, nasty ideologue who has spent his career kicking around immigrants--is now in charge of our fight against coronavirus. This is after the President cut CGPE44, eliminated the global health security units in [ORGANIZATION]4 and at the [ORGANIZATION]5, and we are in trouble. President [PERSON]3 has not only failed to marshal a capable domestic response to the coronavirus he has been slow to take action to confront the virus abroad. We all know that the best thing to do is to stop it from spreading abroad before it spreads to these [LOCATION]. Of course, the President--ego above anything else--has been afraid to criticize President [PERSON]6 or the Communist [ORGANIZATION] S1103 Party of [ORGANIZATION]9 for silencing dissent and obscuring the truth about the coronavirus--where it originated. When [ORGANIZATION]9 obscures the truth, it puts [PERSON]s in danger. Where is President [PERSON]7 voice? The videos emerging from behind [ORGANIZATION]7s internet wall show Chinese people pleading--pleading--with the international community to expose the scope and scale of this epidemic. The response so far by the [PERSON]3 administration is exactly what happens when science skeptics with alternate facts try to run emergency response that requires expertise, planning, knowledge, money, cooperation, and science-based actions. But being anti-science is not just rhetoric. It hurts us. It hurts every [PERSON] in many ways, and that is what President [PERSON]3 and his administration do, and our [LOCATION]an colleagues just blithely go along. After [ORGANIZATION]3 of tiptoeing around [ORGANIZATION]7, after 3 [LOCATION]5 of cutting funding for our epidemic response programs, President [PERSON]3 simply has left [ORGANIZATION]3 unprepared to confront a possible epidemic like corona. I will have more to say DATEDATE34 about what the administration must do to right the ship. [ORGANIZATION]8 Mr. President, on another front, again, the frustration of how this administration has conducted itself is unprecedented. I know some of my colleagues like to say that it is just like [PERSON]. It isnt even close. Here are some more examples, unfortunately, on the trampling of the rule of law in this country. Emboldened by the refusal of [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]ans to hold him accountable in his impeachment trial, President [PERSON]3 has been interfering with [ORGANIZATION]9 and retaliating against officials in his administration who dare testify truthfully before ORG2. In [ORGANIZATION]5 that we have spent in recess, the President has managed to plunge our country even deeper into chaos and certainly has shown the need for having a trial during impeachment with witnesses and documents, getting the truth and not rubberstamping President [PERSON]7 behavior. The President continued to purge his administration, firing officials who refused to pledge allegiance to the President over their allegiance to the Constitution. The President classified [PERSON]7 book in another blatant attempt to cover up the facts. This is what dictatorships do-- dictatorships. They say something is classified they hide the truth. It is a disgrace. The President continued to abuse the pardon power, in one instance commuting the sentence of a notoriously corrupt former official without rhyme or reason. Maybe most egregious of all, the President, angered that the Director of [ORGANIZATION]al Intelligence had the gall to conduct a bipartisan briefing for [ORGANIZATION]0 on foreign interference in our elections, replaced him with a political lackey--a yes-man as the head of [ORGANIZATION]1, where truth needs to be spoken probably more than any other [STREET] in the government. He has no experience in the intelligence community and is simply known as an acolyte to President [PERSON]3. With each of these actions--I hate to say it, but it is true any objective person will know--President [PERSON]3 brings our [ORGANIZATION] closer and closer and closer to a banana republic, a government not of laws but of one man, a government where officials are asked to swear loyalty not to our country or the Constitution but to the President himself, a country where truth is obscured or covered up or deemed fake simply because it is not flattering to the President and is not what he wants to hear. President [PERSON]7 decision to dismiss the [ORGANIZATION]1 Director, the Director of [ORGANIZATION]al Intelligence, is particularly pernicious. Our intelligence community is an institution that is supposed to report on threats to our country with accuracy, without regard to politics, to speak truth to power, to protect us. For the President to install a yes-man at the top of the intelligence community, to politicize a part of our government designed to be apolitical, to so debase the morale of the brave men and women in the [ORGANIZATION]2 and the [ORGANIZATION]3, many of whom risk their lives for our safety, is a disgrace. There are media reports that our intelligence community has found that [PERSON]8 continues to engage in activities to influence the outcome of our election. That is reportedly what former [ORGANIZATION]1 [PERSON]9 team was briefing ORG2 about. So [LOCATION], along with my Democratic colleagues on [ORGANIZATION]4, I am sending a letter to Secretary [PERSON]0 and Secretary [PERSON]1 urging them to impose new sanctions on [PERSON]8 and his cronies using existing sanctions authority. They have it they can do it. Let me repeat that. The [PERSON]3 administration has broad authority to impose sanctions for meddling in our elections. It does not need new legislative tools or approval. Our message is clear Secretary [PERSON]1, impose sanctions now. No one on [ORGANIZATION]5, Democrat or [LOCATION]an, has disputed that GPE50 is attempting to interfere in our elections. Most say GPE50 has already started to do so. So this should be an easy, bipartisan effort. We are being attacked [LOCATION] in real time by foreign adversaries. This is not about party politics. It is not about what [PERSON]3 doesnt want to hear. The GPE50ns wanted him to win in [ORGANIZATION]6 and in all likelihood will want him to win in DATE38. It is about the oath we swear to defend our [LOCATION]. [PERSON]s--I dont care what their party, what their ideology--if they start believing our elections are not on the level, this democracy will be in big trouble. I hope my [LOCATION]an colleagues will join us. The administration could impose sanctions [ORGANIZATION]7, and it should. A repeat performance of [ORGANIZATION]6--another campaign of foreign influence in our elections--is perhaps the greatest threat to our democracy. The Founding Fathers thought so. Read what [PERSON]2 said. We demand that Secretary [PERSON]0 and Secretary [PERSON]1 identify and target all those determined to be responsible for ongoing election interference. Anything less would be an abdication of their responsibility, their sacred, solemn responsibility to protect and defend [ORGANIZATION]3 from the serious threat to our national security and the integrity of our electoral process. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [LOCATION] is recognized."

A recent study from [ORGANIZATION] surveyed 33,000 students across 70 GPE2 community colleges.

It levies a gross receipts tax on businesses when they take in more than 50 million in revenue in the city, or a payroll tax on businesses generating more than 1 billion in revenue.[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] senior director for communications, told [ORGANIZATION] that the distributor has since decided that it will no longer include the [ORGANIZATION] local receipts surcharge when it invoices its [ORGANIZATION] customers.

A number of developments in [LOCATION] highlight the need to scrutinize these ORG28 - specifically the detailed documentation of the terror connections of prominent Palestinian groups and the actions of the [ORGANIZATION]i government see below. Furthermore, in their publications and statements, many ORG28 continue to distort and manipulate events, with the stated aim of isolating [ORGANIZATION] internationally and encouraging [ORGANIZATION] ORG7 to investigate [ORGANIZATION]i officials. [ORGANIZATION] has prepared this short analysis of several key dimensions related to this issue in [LOCATION], highlighting the extreme ideological positions and methodological failures that define NGO reporting on [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]s designation of Palestinian terror-linked ORG28 On [DATE], [LOCATION], the [ORGANIZATION]i ORG9 ORG10 designated six Palestinian ORG28 as terrorist organizations. According to the ORG10, ORG11-P, [ORGANIZATION], ORG13, [PERSON], ORG15 ORG16, and ORG17 were included on [ORGANIZATION]s list of terrorist organizations based on detailed evidence that they are operated by and for the benefit of ORG18, designated as a terrorist organization by the [PERSON], ORG19, [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION]. A seventh [ORGANIZATION]-linked organization - ORG21 ORG22 - was designated in [DATE]. On [PERSON], the Dutch government announced it was freezing funding to [ORGANIZATION] ORG23 citing the ORG28 close links to the [ORGANIZATION]. Foreign Minister [PERSON] and Development Minister [PERSON] revealed that an internal government audit concluded that Dutch funds were used to pay the salaries of two ORG23 employees - PERSON3 and PERSON4 - currently standing trial for their alleged roles in an [ORGANIZATION] bombing that murdered an [ORGANIZATION]i civilian. In [LOCATION], the Dutch Foreign Minister announced that the [PERSON] had ceased all funding to ORG23, after an DATE8 independent investigation verified that at least 34 ORG23 employees [PERSON] were [ORGANIZATION] members. In [DATE] [LOCATION], ORG13 revealed that [PERSON] suspended its funding in May [LOCATION], after apparently receiving information from the [ORGANIZATION]i government. Additionally, [ORGANIZATION]an media reported that the ORG25 instructed its grantee ORG26 to cut funding to ORG[ORGANIZATION]1 until the situation has been clarified.[ORGANIZATION] They all have blood on their hands4Across the anti-[LOCATION] activist space and this includes media, academia, politics and ORG28 there are people who portray [LOCATION]s as sub-human evildoers. The lies these people tell and the hate that they spread has real world consequences. These people have the blood of innocents on their hands. The blood flows on [ORGANIZATION]i streets In [LOCATION]2 fourteen [ORGANIZATION]is have been murdered by Arab terrorists. Let me just begin with the obvious statement those directly responsible for the terrorist attacks in GPE4, [PERSON], GPE6 and GPE7 are the terrorists who carried out the brutal slaughters. But terrorism is never as simple as one man with a weapon. Nobody just wakes up in [TIME] and thinks they should go and slaughter civilians - unless they have been primed to do so within an ideologically twisted environment. Terrorists always believe that their horrific crimes are justified. And this key fact is so relevant when discussing [ORGANIZATION]. Because behind the bullets and knives, behind those slaughtering innocent civilians in [ORGANIZATION]i streets, even behind the radical Islamist terrorist groups - sits a well-oiled industry of [PERSON]-hate - with international factories that are churning out endless material that is enabling, empowering, and providing justifications for the monsters that wish to kill [PERSON]s. Millions of people far removed from the actual conflict zone, also consume this hatred - and go on to spread and promote lies and demonising propaganda about [ORGANIZATION]. In the end all this anti-[PERSON]ish disinformation combines to create an evil atmosphere that rationalises the murder of innocent [ORGANIZATION]i civilians. This does not mean that without the lies and constant demonisation, there would be no terrorism at all against [ORGANIZATION]is, but there would certainly be a lot less of it. The situation has become so twisted [LOCATION]3, that radical Islamist terror groups often play to a western audience. And we all understand this concept, wherever we sit on the political spectrum. When [PERSON] was murdered, the finger of blame was pointed far wider than just at [ORGANIZATION]. And when PERSON8 slaughtered 23 people in a mass shooting in [LOCATION], GPE9, the [ORGANIZATION]6 wasted no time in blaming the atmosphere created by PERSON9. Language matters. Truth matters. Remarkable Outbreak of Antisemitism at ORG29 chapter of ORG30 circulated a statement that, besides casually endorsing the murder of [ORGANIZATION]i civilians, argued that framing is everything and the [LOCATION] grip on the media is omnipresent and also referenced the [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION]-funded [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]ern media. Lets be clear--criticism of [ORGANIZATION], no matter how harsh, isnt necessarily antisemitic. And there are marginal cases where harsh criticism of [ORGANIZATION] is skirting the borderlines of antisemitism, sufficient at least to give the critic plausible deniability. This is not one of those cases. First, the objectionable language noted above is not criticism of [ORGANIZATION], its criticism of the [LOCATION] media in the [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION]. Second, the clearest, most obvious form of antisemitism that tries to obscure itself behind antizionism is when one can substitute the word [LOCATION] for the word [PERSON], and one is left with an obvious, longstanding antisemitic trope. The ORG31 statement falls exactly into that category. Anyone who knows anything about the modern history of antisemitism knows that [PERSON]ish control of the media is about as clear as antisemitic trope as there is. Controlling the media is even listed as one of the most prominent antisemitic canards in ORG32 entry on that topic. If you are unfamiliar with this trope and doubt my account of it, maybe [PERSON]0 statements can help educate you. For example There is a problem in [PERSON]0 with a very strong, powerful tribal group that dominates our media And Wow, I think this whole ORG33 case, really, if we exploit it, can really expose the entire [PERSON]ish manipulation of the [PERSON]0n media. Sometimes [PERSON]1, like [ORGANIZATION], somewhat more subtly refers to [LOCATION] control of the media. Finding an ORG31 chapter mimicking classic Nazi-style antisemitism is, unfortunately, not a surprise, as this is the sort of thing ORG31 has become known for. Whats remarkable instead is the reaction of other student organizations.ORG35 referendum appears to fail at ORG36 [LOCATION] referendum tied to the [PERSON], Divestment and Sanctions movement failed on [LOCATION]4 after a contentious campus battle, the second time in [LOCATION]5 that an that an anti-[ORGANIZATION] measure has failed in an all-campus vote at the Ivy League school, ORG38 has learned. The referendum called on the university to immediately halt the use of ORG39 construction machinery on campus, given the violent role that ORG39 machinery has played in the mass demolition of Palestinian homes, the murder of Palestinians and other innocent people, and the promotion of the prison-industrial complex. The measure required a majority of votes cast in the referendum to pass, and according to unofficial results posted on private social media accounts and obtained by ORG40, 1,124 44 students voted in favor of the referendum, while 1,029 40 students voted against it. A further 424 students 16 abstained, meaning that some 56 of voters either opposed or abstained from the measure. The website used by [PERSON] to conduct the referendum required students to choose between three options  yes, no, abstain  before submitting their ballots. ORG42 President [PERSON]2 would not confirm the leaked results, which had circulated on social media on [LOCATION]4 [TIME], saying that official results would be posted no earlier than [LOCATION]6 at [TIME]. [PERSON] for [PERSON]1, a group of students supporting the referendum, claimed victory in a since-deleted ORG44 post on [LOCATION]4 night.[PERSON]s ORG39 Referendum [ORGANIZATION] am a junior at [PERSON] and a veteran of the [ORGANIZATION] Defense Forces ORG47. I cannot support Referendum No. 3, which calls on [LOCATION] to boycott ORG39 equipment because it is used by [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]ish people have lived in historic [PERSON]1 for [LOCATION]7, and the Palestinian leadership has rejected the two-state solution on multiple occasions. Since [LOCATION]8, at least 1,392 [ORGANIZATION]i citizens - including women and children - have been murdered by Palestinian terrorists. I have personally watched hundreds of rockets fired from [PERSON]2 fly over my head towards [ORGANIZATION]i cities. The referendum ignores the fact that ORG39 machinery is often used to de-escalate violence. In the ORG47, I frequently worked with ORG39 D9 tractors to preemptively set structural boundaries for ORG48-orchestrated riots. Without ORG39 tractors, [ORGANIZATION]i soldiers would have to face the impossible task of stopping thousands of people from charging towards [ORGANIZATION]s border at once. I was there. I watched ORG39 tractors minimize disaster and prevent calamity. The equipment was used to protect the lives of protesters in [PERSON]2 and civilians in [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]ing ORG39 would also harm ORG49 a designated ORG39 distributor which describes itself as a leading participant in [PERSON]1s economic and industrial development. This referendum is precisely the kind of performative, empty activism that non-stakeholders use to solve a problem they scarcely understand. ORG50 student government president wont sign divestment resolution 8A resolution inspired by the boycott, divest and sanctions movement against [ORGANIZATION] that ORG51 student [ORGANIZATION] approved [LOCATION]9 has died after the outgoing student [ORGANIZATION] president, [PERSON]3, failed to sign it. [PERSON]4, an alternate student senator who is a senior at ORG51 in [PERSON]3, told ORG52 DATE20 the resolution - targeting [ORGANIZATION] for their business interests in [ORGANIZATION] - was doomed from the start. Whether the president signed it or not, whether it made it through the trustees or not, at the end, the end game was the same, because it was never going to be implemented, [PERSON]5 said. Its illegal in the state of [PERSON]4 to pass the divestment bill from the [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] specifically, he added, referring to anti-ORG35 legislation passed by the [PERSON]4 legislature in DATE21. So it was a toothless bill that just put [PERSON]ish people at risk. The resolution passed by a vote of 14-8 with two abstentions. Its main impact, [PERSON]5 said, will be to affect campus climate. Theres still a lot of students that I think are going to be pretty upset with that, he said, adding that because of the [STREET] the process was framed, no public forum took [STREET] before the vote, although more than 40 [PERSON]ish students had spoken about the resolution DATE22. Im pretty upset that when people tried to bring those concerns to the table to be heard, they were silenced and shut out of the room.ORG55 Kills Student ORG35 Bill9The ORG56 ORG55 killed a student government bill endorsing the [PERSON], Divestment and Sanctions ORG35 movement in [DATE]. The bill, presented to ORG57 by ORG30 ORG31 and obtained by the ORG59, would have been presented as a referendum question asking if the university should divest its stocks, funds, and endowment from companies that profit from or engage in human rights violations in [PERSON] Prisons, at the [PERSON]-Mexico Border, and in Occupied [PERSON]1. It specifically singled out companies like ORG39, ORG60 and ORG61 for conducting business with the [ORGANIZATION]i military. The bill passed ORG62 on DATE24 by a margin of 17-14, with two abstentions however, the university and ORG63 found that there were technical issues with the bills passage, and thus it was nullified. ORG64 noted in their [DATE] 9 ruling, which was obtained by the ORG59, that there were three specific issues. First, the bill had passed via secret ballot at the behest of those opposed to the bill, which is unconstitutional in the ORG65. The ORG66 lambasted the Speaker and ORG67 for failing to detect such a breach, calling it appalling and damaging to the [PERSON] case. The bill also only obtained a simple majority vote meaning the majority of senators present at a meeting as opposed to the majority of the entire [PERSON] body the latter is required for referendum questions.

SICKENING - more audio from [PERSON]8 speech DATE[ORGANIZATION]1 at ORG73 [PERSON] spreading the antisemitic trope of [PERSON]s controlling the media! pic.twitter .comdNij5veMS811  StopAntisemitism [ORGANIZATION] DATE20, 202212  Funding for Blatantly Antisemitic Speaker [PERSON] From [PERSON]ish Students at ORG74, [PERSON]113High-dollar honorariums that several university student governments paid to bring a controversial Palestinian activist to campus are being denounced by [PERSON]ish student groups, pointing to his record of unrepentant antisemitism. An [PERSON]0n college campus tour by DATE29 [PERSON]9, in support of his new book, [PERSON], has included stops at ORG73 ORG74, [PERSON]1 University and [PERSON]0n University. Currently a columnist for the left-wing magazine ORG77, [PERSON]0 has trafficked in antisemitic tropes, demonized ORG78, and falsely accused [ORGANIZATION]is of eating the organs of Palestinians. Ahead of [PERSON]0s recent appearance at ORG74, at the invitation of the ORG74 [PERSON]1 Cultural Club [ORGANIZATION]2, a coalition of [PERSON]ish groups condemned the use of some 9,955 in student government funding for the event  describing his views as diametrical to the universitys values of inclusivity and peaceful dialogue. We strongly condemn the use of undergraduate student government funding to host a blatantly antisemitic speaker, ORG74 [PERSON] and other groups posted on DATE22. While we understand the laws of free speech protect even the most horrific hate speech, we are disappointed that funding from [ORGANIZATION] will be supporting the visit of [PERSON]0, and we are further frustrated that other student clubs would deem him an appropriate speaker for our campus community, the groups said, calling on [PERSON]ish students to write to ORG74 officials to express their concerns. Despite their protestations, the event went as planned on DATE30. After DATE31 of planning, the [PERSON] Book tour was a success [PERSON]2 read some of his favorite poems, gave us some insight to his writing, and engaged in our audience QampA giving us hope to not feel disparity as a Palestinian and to use our voice and platform to reach bigger audiences in spreading awareness to our cause in freeing [PERSON]1, the [ORGANIZATION]2 said.

Again.25An Exclusively Arab [PERSON]ish Quarter A [ORGANIZATION]6 editorial about [PERSON]0n recognition of [PERSON]6 as [ORGANIZATION]s capital similarly conceals [PERSON]ish history by telling readers that East [PERSON]6, which includes [PERSON], had been exclusively Arab before [ORGANIZATION]s meddling Palestinians anticipated being able to locate their capital in East [PERSON]6 and to have access to Muslim holy sites there, the editorial states  ignoring throughout the presence Judaisms holiest site. East [PERSON]6 was exclusively Arab in DATE35, it continues, but [ORGANIZATION] has steadily built settlements there, placing some 200,000 of its citizens among the Arab population and complicating any possible peace agreement. But this part of [PERSON]6 was exclusively Arab for DATE36, and this was only because it was ethnically cleansed of its [PERSON]s in [LOCATION]. By using DATE35 as the only historical reference point, the paper hides DATE38 of [PERSON]ish presence behind a miniscule [PERSON] that stands out as an anomaly and a disgraceful stain on the history of the area. Concealing the [ORGANIZATION]i Narrative Behind a Palestinian One Perhaps it is only fitting that PERSON[ORGANIZATION]1 piece [DATE] erases [PERSON]ish history, since its apparent purpose is to erase the [PERSON]ish narrative in the face of a wave of Palestinian terrorism. The piece, written by someone who, at least in her youth, defended ORG48 and [ORGANIZATION]7 violence, takes aim at [ORGANIZATION]s security barrier precisely at the time that its importance was highlighted by a spate of deadly Palestinian attacks, including two attacks, in GPE7 and GPE6, by Palestinians who infiltrated [ORGANIZATION] from the [ORGANIZATION] Bank. Despite a few lines acknowledging that the barrier is a security measure, the piece promotes the Palestinian narrative that the barrier is a land grab by [ORGANIZATION]. Incredibly, the article says nothing about the terror attacks in GPE7 and GPE6, though they are clearly relevant to any discussion of the barrier. It seems this recent history, just like ancient [PERSON]ish history, doesnt fit the narrative.[ORGANIZATION]6 [PERSON] as Paper Smears [PERSON]9 [PERSON]s as Racist Profiteers26[ORGANIZATION]5 bias in news articles shows itself in editorial decisions about what to attribute, and how to attribute it  and about what to leave unattributed. Its a subtle and perhaps abstract point, but a few recent examples may help to show what I mean. One [ORGANIZATION]8 article, a [ORGANIZATION] Bank Dispatch by [PERSON]8, mentions [ORGANIZATION]i settlements and says, Most of the world considers those settlements a violation of international law, though [ORGANIZATION] insists that there has been a [PERSON]ish presence in the [ORGANIZATION] Bank for DATE38. The phrase [ORGANIZATION] insists was flagged by [PERSON]9, a senior research analyst at ORG90. Why is it needed? Does the [ORGANIZATION]6 doubt the veracity of it? The [ORGANIZATION]8 could have simply written, though there has been a [PERSON]ish presence in the [ORGANIZATION] Bank for DATE38. Or though extensive archeological and textual evidence attests to the fact that there has been a [PERSON]ish presence in the [ORGANIZATION] Bank for DATE38. Instead, you get the strange formulation of an entire country  [ORGANIZATION]  insisting on something, as if its a cranky restaurant customer or a petulant child. Its almost like the [ORGANIZATION]8 is afraid of investigating the underlying facts for fear that they might disturb the newspapers far-left readers, or hamper the reporters ability to operate freely in [ORGANIZATION]0-controlled [ORGANIZATION] Bank.Yes, [ORGANIZATION] Theyre Not White[ORGANIZATION]1Frank [PERSON], the man arrested for [DATE]0 [ORGANIZATION]2 subway shooting, is a black nationalist and outspoken racist who railed against whites, [PERSON]s, and Hispanics. A careful reader of the [ORGANIZATION]6 could be forgiven for overlooking that. In a nearly 2,000-word article on the attack, PERSON30 race is not mentioned. The same is true for the coverage offered up by ORG92 [ORGANIZATION] only mentioned PERSON30 race in relation to his condemnation of training programs for low-income Black youths. [ORGANIZATION] critics on the right say that the conspicuous omission of PERSON30 race from these news reports illustrates a trend among prestige papers, which deemphasize or omit the race of non-white criminals while playing up the race of white offenders. But is it a real pattern? Yes. A ORG94 review of hundreds of articles published by major papers over [DATE]1 finds that papers downplay the race of non-white offenders, mentioning their race much later in articles than they do for white offenders. These papers are also three to four times more likely to mention an offenders race at all if he is white, a disparity that grew in the wake of PERSON31 death in [DATE]2 and the protests that followed. ORG95 collected data on nearly 1,100 articles about homicides from six major papers, all written [DATE] and [LOCATION]. Those papers included ORG96, Los Angeles [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]6, ORG98, [ORGANIZATION]3 ORG99, and ORG100 of each paper did not return requests for comment for this article. For each article, we collected the offenders and victims name and race, and noted where in the article the offenders race was mentioned, if at all.[ORGANIZATION] Spotlight on Religious Freedom in [ORGANIZATION] Doesnt Extend to [ORGANIZATION] Christian Pastor28As [DATE]4 of [DATE]5, [DATE]6, and [DATE]7 converge, [ORGANIZATION]s need to strike a delicate balance between facilitating access by members of numerous religious denominations to their respective holy sites, and keeping [PERSON]6 and [ORGANIZATION] secure amid a Palestinian terror wave, has been covered widely see here, here, here, and here. Yet as tens of thousands of worshipers of all faiths flock to [LOCATION], the story of a Palestinian evangelical pastor who was jailed for [DATE]8 after being arrested for meeting with a [PERSON]ish former member of [ORGANIZATION]s parliament, hasnt generated a mention from international news outlets. And this latest incident was just part of a pattern, largely unreported, of [ORGANIZATION]0 ORG101 persecuting Christians. Local media outlets reported on [DATE]9 that Palestinian security forces had released Pastor PERSON32 from prison. PERSON33 was detained on [DATE] 2, and his Christian [INSTITUTION]  [ORGANIZATION]4 in [ORGANIZATION]5  was shut down following a purported meeting with former [ORGANIZATION]i parliamentarian PERSON34. The Palestinian leadership accused PERSON33 of promoting normalization with the [LOCATION] entity and welcoming an extremist [LOCATION] settler.At my high school, the Holocaust is barely taught in history class. That scares me29In middle school, I invited my grandfather to speak to my classmates about his experiences during the Holocaust. He spoke about his good luck Hed been playing ball with friends when he drew the short straw and had to retrieve water for the group from home  and encountered his panicked family almost out the door. He talked about his parents decision to accept the help of Italian soldiers at the Swiss border, despite the risk of betrayal, and about his dreary and demoralizing life as a teenager in a refugee camp. My peers listened with their mouths open, much like I do every time I hear these stories. After he finished, he had tears in his eyes. Then someone asked, What were non-[PERSON]s doing to stop this? Ive heard so little about the Holocaust during [PERSON]1 in school that if I didnt have intimate personal connections to it, I could easily put it in the back of my mind. My 10th grade history class in [ORGANIZATION]6 spent [PERSON]2 elaborating on the [STREET] of life of ancient Mesopotamians and [PERSON]3 on the Holocaust. Its hard to fathom. PERSON35 holds up the identification number tattooed by Nazis upon her arrival at FAC1 in [PERSON]4. She expresses a responsibility to accept speaking invitations because somebody has to do it. [ORGANIZATION]6 requires [PERSON]5 of high school history, and World History II is the only course that touches on the Holocaust. [ORGANIZATION] guidelines for this class include teaching 61 broad topics  one of them folds the Holocaust into examples of genocide in [PERSON]6. Its not enough. Such gaps in education about the Holocaust make me afraid. Im afraid that the collective ignorance and ongoing hatred of [PERSON]s will grow into something so much more, and it makes me fear for my loved ones and myself. Im afraid that Im seeing seeds of civil unrest, and educators arent doing enough to stop it. When my friend made that joke in seventh grade, I said nothing because I didnt want to be ostracized for ruining his funny moment. I now recognize that his comment stemmed from ignorance. Each generation needs to be taught about the events and ideology that allowed the Holocaust to occur so that it can be given an opportunity to understand the horrifying consequence of unchecked hate and ignorance. We need to make sure the lessons of the Holocaust outlive the last survivors.Notorious antisemite [PERSON] sentenced to jail once again after action by ORG102 notorious antisemite [PERSON] has been sentenced to jail [PERSON]7 once again, after being found guilty of a communications offence following action by [ORGANIZATION]. Last [PERSON]2 [PERSON]9 trial at [ORGANIZATION]minster Magistrates [STREET] concerned a video of the scene in the classic PERSON37 film when PERSON38, a fictitious [PERSON]ish criminal a character that has come under significant criticism over [ORGANIZATION]0 for its antisemitic depiction, is explaining to his newest recruit how his legion of children followers pick pockets. Ms PERSON39 uploaded the video and sings an accompanying song of her own about how [PERSON]s are greedy, grift for shekels and cheat on their taxes. The video appeared to be either a bizarre fundraising effort for her mounting legal costs due to numerous charges she has faced, including several ongoing prosecutions in which [ORGANIZATION] has provided evidence, or an attempt at mockery of [ORGANIZATION] for pursuing her in the courts. At [STREET], Ms PERSON39 tried to suggest that the video was part of a personal quarrel and that her racism is directed not at [PERSON]s but at [LOCATION]s. She expressed scepticism about the facts of the Holocaust on the stand, and replicated a racist PERSON40 gesture, which she has performed in the past. She rather insightfully observed that antisemitism is not a crime. If it was, the prisons would be full. Summing up, Judge [PERSON] said that the defendant was making up evidence as she went along, and she did not accept Ms PERSON39s claim that her song was about the controversial activist PERSON43, describing that suggestion as ludicrous. Instead, Judge PERSON44 said, I have not doubt that the song related to [PERSON]s. She further noted that, given Ms PERSON39s previous convictions, she knew exactly what she was doing and that she had a propensity to commit these types of offences. The prosecution asked the [STREET] to take into account that the whole [PERSON]ish community was a victim in this crime and that Ms PERSON39 had an incomplete report of her previous sentences.GPE[ORGANIZATION]1 man targeting [PERSON]s warned of blood bath before attacking victims prosecutors31An antisemitic [ORGANIZATION]8 man went on a shocking [TIME]-long crime spree targeting Hasidic [PERSON]s  having warned his family to expect a blood bath, according to police documents.

ORG107 Minister PERSON47 confirmed he was among their targets and had received police protection. A central goal of the group was to destroy power supply facilities in order to cause a prolonged nationwide blackout, the investigators said. This was intended to cause civil war-like conditions and ultimately overthrow the democratic system in [PERSON]2, they said.

A legal settlement organized by [ORGANIZATION] restitution department states that proceeds from the sale will be divided between the descendants of the works original owner, [PERSON]4, and a French family who are the paintings current owners. The artwork is expected to be sold for 18-25 million. The owner of a textile factory in [PERSON]2 who had a vast art collection, [PERSON]5 purchased the [PERSON]2 painting from a German dealer in [LOCATION]4. The artwork was previously exhibited at [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]5. [PERSON]5 was targeted by the Nazis for being [PERSON]ish, wealthy and a member of [ORGANIZATION]. Before he fled [PERSON]2 to the [PERSON] in [LOCATION]6, he auctioned hundreds of pieces from his art collection. [ORGANIZATION], effet de neige remained unsold and later came into the possession of French art collector [PERSON]6, and eventually his descendants, who are the paintings current owners, according to [ORGANIZATION].

Mr [PERSON]8, whose grandmother assisted children who arrived in GPE44 on the [ORGANIZATION], an initiative in DATE81 to rescue nearly 10,000 [PERSON]ish children from [ORGANIZATION], described his motivation in the creation of his game, The Light in the Darkness. Some dont believe video games can be educational. Thats something I disagree with, he said. The problem is, no one has thought about what is the next step, or how do we continue education in new ways? Because I think education is trying to get the digital generation to adapt to them, rather than trying to adapt to the digital generation. Pointing to the successes of previous artforms in providing Holocaust education after meeting initial resistance, Mr [PERSON]8 said Comic books were viewed as insane at one point until Maus came out. Films were kind of viewed like, I dont know, man, until [LOCATION] came out, and [ORGANIZATION]. Video games need to be able to tackle the subject because were the number one form of entertainment, and I think rather than discourage game developers towards doing it, we should actually be able to guide game developers and encourage them to make these games, because then there would be more awareness. The story of the game revolves around Polish [PERSON]s in GPE40 during the Holocaust, Mr [PERSON]8 told our host.

Testing. [ORGANIZATION] conducted an average of 156,000 DATE2 tests over [ORGANIZATION], compared to 114,000 at the same point in [DATE] and about 1,900 in DATE5, state data show4. The state recently unveiled a 25 million lab5 to double total testing capacity, though it was plagued with an unexpectedly high number of inconclusive test results6 during [ORGANIZATION]. Meanwhile, cities are [ORGANIZATION] their testing efforts8 ahead of [ORGANIZATION]  though health officials worry many residents are getting tested to justify going to parties or traveling9. Economy. One piece of bright news The state collected 11 billion more in revenue for DATE8 than originally projected, according to a [ORGANIZATION] report from the state [ORGANIZATION]. Still, significant challenges remain. With more businesses forced to close their doors or limit services, more [ORGANIZATION]ns will likely file for unemployment and find it harder to make rent or mortgage payments  even as the states eviction moratorium11 is set to expire in DATE10. ORG1 President [PERSON] PERSON1 The need for federal stimulus is still critical to help [ORGANIZATION] continue to meet some of our states most pressing needs, which includes enhancing unemployment benefits, providing relief for renters and mom-and-pop landlords, and supporting local governments and our schools.  [ORGANIZATION]. With 94 of [ORGANIZATION]s [PERSON] now in the most restrictive tier, it looks increasingly unrealistic14 that millions of K-12 students will be able to return to campus in DATE11. Meanwhile, [ORGANIZATION] community colleges have seen a 9 drop in enrollment, potentially decreasing the number of students who go on to earn bachelors degrees, [ORGANIZATION]. ______________The coronavirus bottom lineAs of 9 p.m. [ORGANIZATION] night, [ORGANIZATION] had1,037,978 confirmed coronavirus casesand18,299 deathsfrom the virus, according [LOCATION] tracker16.Also[LOCATION] regularly updates this pandemic timeline tracking thestates DATE2 actions17.

[PERSON] wasted 2.7 billion for affordable housing [ORGANIZATION] ORG3 Auditor PERSON3 at a press briefing in [ORGANIZATION]. Photo by PERSON4 for [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]s affordable housing shortage is due in part to the states failure to develop a well-coordinated plan, which allowed a state agency to mismanage and ultimately lose 2.7 billion that could have financed thousands of affordable housing units, according to a scathing report the state auditor released [ORGANIZATION]19. The news comes as [ORGANIZATION] scrambles to find permanent [ORGANIZATION] for homeless people temporarily housed in hotels amid the pandemic and thousands of renters stare down an eviction moratorium that expires in DATE1021. Although the state needs to build an estimated 125,000 affordable housing units DATE14 through [PERSON] to meet demand, its only supported an average of 19,000 units DATE14, the auditor found. A major factor [ORGANIZATION]s labyrinthine financing process. While most large states have one department that handles affordable housing funding, [ORGANIZATION] has five  and they report to different elected officials, meaning no one oversees the entire system, ORG5 reports22. The lack of state oversight has also slowed development in cities and counties, which as of DATE16 had issued building permits for only 11 of the affordable units in their housing plans. To overhaul the process, the auditor recommended eliminating one of the state agencies, improving communication among the others, and strengthening state oversight of local development. On DATE17, the [ORGANIZATION] Department of Housing and Community Development announced23 it would temporarily pause some affordable housing funding programs while other state agencies revised their funding criteria in order to achieve increased collaboration and alignment for our customers. 2.

Disability rights advocates want the hospitals to release medically fragile patients, arguing the system hasnt done enough to mitigate the risks of a virus that has so far infected 500 staff members and 400 patients, 19 of whom have died. Yet the hospitals are also under pressure in [STREET] to admit more patients  namely, mentally ill inmates from the state prison system, through which coronavirus has spread rapidly, [PERSON] reports for [LOCATION]24. The inmates attorneys say the hospitals should start accepting prisoners without first requiring they test negative for [PERSON], as well as those who have tested positive.

As [ORGANIZATION] has demonstrated, local leaders can meaningfully reduce homelessness through a strategy of tough loveâleading with the provision of shelter and services but maintaining public order through outreach, cleanups, and enforcement of anti-camping laws. Some progressive leaders have complained that enforcement policies shift the burden of homelessness onto the largest cities. But [ORGANIZATION] is the nationâs fourth-largest city. And cities already compete on taxes, infrastructure, amenities, and various other policy choicesâwhy should homeless policy not be among them? Small and medium-size cities should not lower their standards of public order rather, it is incumbent upon neighboring cities to reduce the âœmagnet effectâ of their own permissive policies."

[PERSON] replaces PERSON2, a [ORGANIZATION] native who grew up in public housing and was the citys first woman of color to have the mayors job albeit briefly, as [ORGANIZATION] was appointed acting mayor in [ORGANIZATION] after Mayor [PERSON] died in office. Yet, [PERSON]s backers have championed him as a blow to tech industry special interests. Welcome to [ORGANIZATION].The new mayor isnt really the new mayorIn [ORGANIZATION] DATE10, [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] mayor of [ORGANIZATION], died of a heart attack. PERSON2, FAC0 supervisor, was appointed as acting mayor, and a new special mayoral election will be held in [LOCATION] to establish [PERSON] proper replacement. Under [PERSON] watch, [ORGANIZATION] became increasingly cozy with the tech industry, giving tax breaks for companies like [ORGANIZATION] to maintain its headquarters in the city. On [DATE] [TIME], [PERSON] reports, [ORGANIZATION] lost a vote to be named interim mayor 5-41, and supervisor [PERSON] was since elected to the position with a 6-3 vote from the board of supervisors. As Mission Locals PERSON7 wrote2, In short, the left-leaning bloc of the citys legislative body, at this particular moment in American history, chose to unseat a black woman who worked her [STREET] from public housing to FAC1 and replace her with a well-off white venture capitalist who graduated from ORG2 and lives in the [ORGANIZATION]. But theres more to it than that. PERSON2 is already district 5 supervisor and president of the board of supervisors, and shes also running in the election to replace [PERSON] as elected mayor  so her acting as interim mayor would make for a significant concentration of power. Supervisor [PERSON] stressed the need for the separation of powers prior to [ORGANIZATION] vote, according to [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON2 is also viewed by some as the candidate of choice of the tech industry, which has transformed [ORGANIZATION] and the surrounding area, with widespread gentrification and sky-high rents and costs pushing some longtime residents out. In [ORGANIZATION] DATE10, The [ORGANIZATION] Examiner published an article alleging4 that [PERSON] billionaire [ORGANIZATION] supports [ORGANIZATION]s candidacy for mayor and was canvassing for her at [PERSON]s funeral. [PERSON]2 did not return a request for comment. Despite the optics, [PERSON]s supporters insist that its he who is in fact the bulwark against the tech industry.

She was groomed for this position by the past three majors, starting with [PERSON]4. So who is the real anti tech mayor?As ORG6 reported in [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION] centered her [ORGANIZATION] supervisor re-election campaign on building and protecting affordable housing, a crucial issue in a city where the median cost of rent has soared to 4,450 a [PERSON]. Thats not to say that [ORGANIZATION] is inherently opposed to tech or unwilling to collaborate with the industry.

From [LOCATION] to DATE2, [ORGANIZATION] homeless population has increased by about 21,0002 to a total of just over 150,000, according to a new [PERSON] report. [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 are doing their best to help, which in this case means pointing and yeliing about human excrement and discarded needles on the sidewalks, proving that Democrats make life worse. The president has threatened to [PERSON] on homelessness in GPE2 without offering any substantial aid or specific proposals, because why would he want to give up a perfectly good applause line at his rallies? ORG2s upcoming budget plan is aimed at4 addressing homelessness at all levels, funding existing facilities that serve people without housing, building more shelters and transitional housing, providing temporary safe parking 5locations for people living out of cars and RVs, and funding rent and other assistance for people before they get evicted. The emphasis is on housing first -- getting people into housing so theyre off the streets, and then connecting them to mental health, substance abuse, other services they need to keep a roof over their head. The 750 million in new funding comes on top of 650 million the legislature approved [ORGANIZATION] but which couldnt be spent due to [ORGANIZATION], so ORG2 had to take emergency action [PERSON] to release the funds. The new funds wont require new taxes, since they come from a revenue surplus in the general fund,7 but they must be approved by the state legislature, meaning the new funding wont get to counties and cities before DATE5. In the meantime, ORG2 will ask for additional help from charities and private sector sources.The proposal to upgrade [ORGANIZATION] hasnt yet been finalized, but this outline8 from [LOCATION] sounds like a pretty smart idea that dovetails with ORG2s housing-first goals The effort appears to be in line with recommendations made in [ORGANIZATION] to refocus many of the states healthcare efforts on so-called whole-person care, which takes into account social conditions that affect a persons well-being. For those who are homeless, that would include help finding adequate housing and financial assistance with the care needed to recuperate from living in unsheltered environments. The governors budget proposal would also restructure county-managed behavioral health programs so that the services more closely resemble those offered by other healthcare providers. ORG6 also notes 9the plan would provide safe shelter as repeat emergency room visitors recuperate from illness or injury, so people arent simply being given the legally mandated care necessarily to stabilize them ... then sent off in a taxi to FAC0, sometimes still in their hospital gowns. In addition, ORG2 wants to fix problems with how providers get paid for behavior health services, and to fully integrate mental health and substance abuse services with the larger [ORGANIZATION] program. Like ORG7 anywhere, the expansion of [ORGANIZATION] would be paid for through a mix of federal and state funding. Wow, we got through all that without once saying holistic. Nuts.All in all, it sounds like a well-thought-out approach to addressing one of [ORGANIZATION] biggest challenges.

san francisco,2016-10-28T00:00:00Z,Dissident Voice,San Francisco Chronicle,"homeless, homelessness, affordable housing",Secede to Succeed,"[ORGANIZATION] The top reason is that [PERSON]ns are physically separated from [ORGANIZATION]ns. If you look at whats called a population density map or the map of the world at [TIME] you will notice that [ORGANIZATION] is not populated across all of its land-mass. From the [ORGANIZATION] coast to about half [STREET] through [PERSON] and from the Southern border to the [PERSON]nadian border there are [ORGANIZATION]ns. This is where they live. From halfway through [PERSON] all the [STREET] to the border of [PERSON] is basically no one. Yes, there are the cities of GPE4, [PERSON], GPE6 and GPE7 - but when you look the maps it will show that outside of these few cities, there is no one living in about half of the land mass of [ORGANIZATION]. Then at the border of GPE8 [PERSON] and [PERSON] all the [STREET] to [PERSON] there is another giant population cluster. This population cluster is the size of most large nations such as [PERSON]0 or [PERSON]1 or the [PERSON]2 - it is the size of a large nation. This distance of essentially no population between what I call the Main [ORGANIZATION]n Population or [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION] population is equivalent to the distance between [PERSON]3 and [PERSON]4 across LOC2, between Islamic [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] separated by [PERSON], between Spanish speaking South [ORGANIZATION] and Portuguese speaking South [ORGANIZATION] separated by the rain forest. Whenever you have two large populations separated by such a vast amo[ORGANIZATION]t of land with no population connecting the two - you get vastly different cultures. Why is [PERSON] not like [PERSON], or [PERSON]3 not like [PERSON]4, or why do they speak Spanish in part of South [ORGANIZATION] and Portuguese in another part - because of this population divide. Its not [ORGANIZATION]s fault or [PERSON]s fault - no one is to be blamed. It is just that when humans form huge population clusters and there is a giant distance between these two population clusters you get vastly different cultures. This is why [PERSON]s moved on enacting [ORGANIZATION] - while [ORGANIZATION]ns still debate if it is real, why [PERSON]ns do things like ban plastic bags, and provide for multi-cultural multi-lingual education while [ORGANIZATION] debates if multi-lingual education is a good thing and immigration, and thinks the idea of banning plastic bags is just crazy. I am sure you have heard of jokes about how all [PERSON]ns are crazy, or its the land of nuts. Chinese people think some things that [PERSON]4 does are to be considered backwards, and the difference between how [PERSON]ans and [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]ns think is huge. This cultural gap is never going to away [ORGANIZATION]less the area between [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] population is bridged. That will never happen. [ORGANIZATION] conquered this fly-over states area and committed genocide against the Plains [PERSON]4ns to own the land, then enacted the homestead act to populate it [LOCATION]. Its still not populated. In fact the [ORGANIZATION]n Census shows that most yo[ORGANIZATION]g people in the fly-over states are leaving and moving to the [PERSON]. So [ORGANIZATION] tried to populate this gap and failed and the gap is growing even wider. This suggests the population gap between the [PERSON]5 and [ORGANIZATION] culture will never be bridged. Things might work out if this was just a slight change in the [STREET] that people prepare soup or what sorts of games they like to watch on TV, or sorts of dances they prefer to dance - slight cultural variations [ORGANIZATION] can easily handle, like how [PERSON]7ers and Texans talk differently, but are all [ORGANIZATION]ns. [PERSON] is too culturally different. The majority of the protest movement against the Vietnam War was in [PERSON]. The majority of the protest movement against the [PERSON]1 War was in [PERSON]. The only [STREET] to move on creating regulation for [ORGANIZATION] before the ORG6 government enacted legislation is [PERSON]. The first [STREET] to create air quality regulation was [PERSON]. The only [STREET] where a sitting governor wrote an essay recently pleading with [ORGANIZATION] to get along with [PERSON]6 and prevent war was [PERSON]. The only state where the sitting governor refused to enact part of the NDAA - or [ORGANIZATION]n national security act, specifically the part that says the ORG6 government can kidnap citizens and fly them to a black site where they are tortured, was [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] had PERSON1 movement - ORG2 were nearly exclusively created and existed in [PERSON]. The [PERSON] was created in [ORGANIZATION], while the [LOCATION] movement was almost exclusively created in [PERSON]. [PERSON] does actsreacts in ways very different from how [ORGANIZATION] reacts to the same issues. It has been this [STREET] since DATE2 - which means for [ORGANIZATION]. That suggests the wide cultural differences will not go away. Still while this suggests two different nations - going by the definition that a nation is a [STREET] where the people have defined borders, a [ORGANIZATION]ique identity and a different culture - perhaps [ORGANIZATION] could make it work with [PERSON] as part of the [ORGANIZATION], except for the fact that [ORGANIZATION] hates, picks on, and financially abuses [PERSON] and has done so for [PERSON]. This is what makes the need for [PERSON] to secede conclusive. [PERSON] is a donor state and pays more into the ORG6 system than it receives back in services from the ORG6 government. For about 25-35 states, depending on DATE5 - they get back more in services from the ORG6 government roads, schools, loans than they pay in - so the ORG6 system works for them. [PERSON] for [ORGANIZATION] has always lost financially being part of [ORGANIZATION] - it always paid more in than it got out. This is the definition of [ORGANIZATION]fair - because compared to 49 states, [PERSON] has been rated by the ORG6 government as having the worst, roads, schools, dams, airports, infrastructure of all kind. So for many [PERSON] - [PERSON] has paid for aro[ORGANIZATION]d 30 states to continue to have roads, schools, dams, airports, infrastructure and a quality of life better than [PERSON]ns. [PERSON]ns know their roads and schools are falling apart. [PERSON] has many poor people - why do we pay for others to have life better than us? If [PERSON] had the top 10 in comparison to the other 49 states in education and infrastructure things might be different - but for [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] has been at the bottom of almost everything while aro[ORGANIZATION]d 30 states do better - because the ORG6 government leeches money from [PERSON]. This is why we say [PERSON] is [ORGANIZATION]s colony - a [STREET] to use for resources and nothing more. Perhaps people might think that there is a simple acco[ORGANIZATION]ting error that created this situation - except that it has gone on for [PERSON], and when Governor PERSON2 brought up this situation he was called a liar by [PERSON] Senators PERSON3 and PERSON4 - even though he was right about this. Its weird for senators to attack the sitting governor of their own state when he talks about how to make life better in that state - but that is exactly what happened when the [ORGANIZATION] governor brought up this issue. It makes you think that the ORG6 government - where senators live, but not where the Governor lives, knows that it is milking [PERSON] dry and wants to keep it that [STREET] - aka they know they are doing something wrong. Finally - we think that there is some sort of abusive usury relationship between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] because [ORGANIZATION] has the worst of everything and yet pays more out for others at the same time - and is insulted by [ORGANIZATION] routinely. Type in [ORGANIZATION] hates [PERSON] and see the amo[ORGANIZATION]t of responses from real [ORGANIZATION]ns about how they feel about [PERSON]. How many times have conservatives - who are half of the [ORGANIZATION]n voters - said they hate [PERSON]7 values or [PERSON]8 values? When you list Southern [PERSON] and the [PERSON]1 part as examples of what [ORGANIZATION]ns should not be - it means that you are saying all of [PERSON] is basically not a good example for [ORGANIZATION]n culture. There are more scientific notes that show that [ORGANIZATION] genuinely hates [PERSON]. A few polls have been done - one in [LOCATION] by ORG7 that said half of [ORGANIZATION] wants [ORGANIZATION] kicked out the [ORGANIZATION]ion, another one in [LOCATION] by ORG8 real estate that said [ORGANIZATION] thinks [ORGANIZATION] is the worst of all 50 states, one in DATE9 by ORG9 which also said [ORGANIZATION]ns want [ORGANIZATION] to secede, another one in DATE9 by [PERSON]0 that said [ORGANIZATION] is the worst of all 50 states, and finally a poll in [LOCATION]0 by [PERSON]1 showing [ORGANIZATION] has the worst opinion of all 50 states about [PERSON]. In [LOCATION]0, the magazine [PERSON]2 said that [ORGANIZATION]n business leaders said [PERSON] should secede from the [ORGANIZATION] because they hated it, [LOCATION]1 both the [PERSON]8 Chronicle and [PERSON]4 asked why [ORGANIZATION]ns hate [PERSON] so much. In [LOCATION]2, the [PERSON]5 editorial staff wrote that it seems to them that [ORGANIZATION] hates [PERSON], and in [LOCATION]3 both [PERSON]6 magazine and the [PERSON]7 [PERSON]6s newspaper admitted that there seems to be a special [STREET] of hate in all of [ORGANIZATION] for just [PERSON]. When someone hates you because you act differently and have acted differently for a long time - maybe they hate you for who you are. If they at the same time, take money from you [LOCATION]4, to the degree that they can see you are falling down, and yet they still take money and give it to other people who are clearly doing much better than you - maybe they think it is okay to abuse you and dont care if it hurts you. What rational [PERSON]n would think this is not an abusive relationship? PERSON5 [PERSON]n you walk us through the legal framework for a state to secede from the [ORGANIZATION]ion? What is the broad strategy that Yes[PERSON] is pursuing for secession? Tell us about your ballot initiative, and your plans for a [LOCATION]5 referendum. How would it work? [ORGANIZATION] The [ORGANIZATION]n Constitution says that each state in the [ORGANIZATION] shall retain every power which is not by the Constitution given to the federal government. The Constitution does not give the power of secession to the federal government, nor does it expressly prohibit the states from exercising this power. Therefore, the power of secession is reserved to the states, or to the people, per the Tenth Amendment. Further, the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution says that treaties ratified by [PERSON]9 are the supreme law of the land. In [LOCATION]6, [PERSON]9 ratified the [ORGANIZATION] Charter, a treaty that guarantees peoples the right to self-determination in Article I. Thus, by ratifying this treaty, [PERSON]9 adopted the right of self-determination as the supreme law of our land. Furthermore - [PERSON], who invented the concept of politics and government, wrote that the state is a culmination of widening circles of human association based on human wants, and that it is the highest form of human association. Why is this important? It is important because in [LOCATION]7, GPE20 adopted its Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 20 of that Declaration provides that No one may be compelled to belong to an association. Yes [PERSON] expresses the stance, as [PERSON] argued, that the state is an association and therefore we [PERSON]ns may not be compelled to belong to the [ORGANIZATION], or the co[ORGANIZATION]try, that is [PERSON]9 of [ORGANIZATION]. Because [ORGANIZATION] signed on to the [ORGANIZATION] charter, and because the [ORGANIZATION] created the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and because [ORGANIZATION] still associated with the [ORGANIZATION] after that declaration - it means that if [PERSON] can show that it does not want to belong to the association of the [ORGANIZATION]n government - then according to the law of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] law - [ORGANIZATION] has to recognize this and respect the right of self-determination for the future [PERSON] nation. Another legal opening for secession in [ORGANIZATION] comes from the case of [PERSON] versus [ORGANIZATION] - it is the only [ORGANIZATION]n federal ORG21 case that actually dealt with the topic of secession. The [STREET] ruled that When [PERSON] became one of [PERSON]9, she entered into an indissoluble relation. The [ORGANIZATION]ion between [PERSON] and the other [PERSON] was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the [ORGANIZATION]ion between the original [PERSON]. There was no [STREET] for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the [PERSON]. We focus on the phrase except through consent of the [PERSON] which means that if the [ORGANIZATION]n[PERSON]9, or a Convention of the [ORGANIZATION]n [PERSON] agreed that [ORGANIZATION] could become independent - then according to the highest [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION] it is legal to secede that [STREET]. This interpretation was recently backed up by Professor [PERSON], who earned a PhD in political science from [PERSON] and teaches government at the prestigious ORG25. The professor admitted in [LOCATION]0, to the [ORGANIZATION] Business [PERSON]6s that [PERSON] versus [ORGANIZATION] did leave open this door. In [LOCATION]8 Yes [PERSON] will file for an initiative. In [PERSON], any citizen can ask to [STREET] a proposed law up for a vote of the people of [PERSON] - if they pay a small fee of [DATE] and collect enough signatures - somewhere aro[ORGANIZATION]d 400,000, within [LOCATION]9 time frame. If you collect the required amo[ORGANIZATION]t of signatures, within time, then you qualify to have your suggested law available for the public to vote on. If the public votes for that proposal - then it becomes law. This is called direct democracy and it is most prevalent in [PERSON] in comparison to essentially any other government on the [PERSON]2 - not just in comparison to 49 states of [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] magazine said that because of this [PERSON]ns had too much democracy - as if thats possible. Yes [PERSON] wants to build up enough awareness of [PERSON]ns about independence so that when we start to collect signatures in [LOCATION]8 - there will be thousands of [PERSON]ns who are out trying to get other [PERSON]ns to sign the initiative within the DATE20 period. Currently in DATE21, we are at 3,000 [PERSON]ns who said they would vol[ORGANIZATION]teer - if we can get to aro[ORGANIZATION]d 10,000 vol[ORGANIZATION]teers toward the end of [LOCATION]8 we would be in a competitive position to get the signatures without having to spend money on advertising - meaning we could accomplish this with purely grassroots effort. If the movement collects enough signatures in [LOCATION]8 - then a vote for the initiative would happen in [LOCATION]5. If [PERSON]ns vote yes on the initiative - which simply asks if [PERSON]ns would like to be independent - then [PERSON] can say definitively that [PERSON]ns want to be a separate nation from [ORGANIZATION]. At that point the [PERSON] government would take the results of this vote to the federal government and ask to begin negotiations for [PERSON] to become an independent nation. We think that [ORGANIZATION] will listen to the will of [PERSON]ns and allow [PERSON] to secede at this point for two reasons. One is that numerous polls taken in just the DATE23 show that [ORGANIZATION]ns hate [PERSON] and that many [ORGANIZATION]ns have already suggested that [PERSON] secede from the [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]ns do not like [PERSON]ns and so we expect there wont be a big fight among the [ORGANIZATION]n people to keep [PERSON] in the [ORGANIZATION]. We want to use the hate [ORGANIZATION] has for [PERSON] as the catalyst to legally secede. While [PERSON] financially contributes to [ORGANIZATION] - [ORGANIZATION]n politics are not decided on rational debates but on emotional pleas - we expect the [ORGANIZATION]ns to continue behaving the [STREET] that they do when they have to vote on big decisions. We believe that the emotion of hate which [ORGANIZATION]ns already feel in ab[ORGANIZATION]dance to [PERSON] will over rule any one bringing up the rational point that [ORGANIZATION] feeds financially off of [PERSON]. Also, Yes [PERSON] took a lot of inspiration from the fact that recently, GPE23 decided to hold a vote on independence, even though the Spanish government said the vote would not be legally binding. GPE23 had the vote, and invited international reporters and election monitors to observe the vote and report what they saw. Over the protests of the Spanish government who said it wouldnt recognize the vote - the entire world was informed by these international reportersobservers that [ORGANIZATION] wanted independence. The struggle to gain independence did not end there - but with this act GPE23 made the entire world aware that its people want to be independent. The Spanish government was immediately put in a difficult position of saying - it is a democracy but does not want its people to be able to have the government that they want. GPE23 came out looking like a hero and gained international connections with other nations because of this act, and the Spanish government came out looking like a villain. At some point there might be enough international pressure on GPE24 - because the whole world knows what GPE23 wants - that it might be forced to recognize there is a legitimate [PERSON] secession movement or at least start negotiating to some degree with the [PERSON] separatists. Thats not the end of the story but the entire [PERSON] cause for nationhood would jump to the next level if either of these two actions took [STREET]. [PERSON] after a vote for independence would be in the same situation as GPE23 but with even better chances. The fact is that [PERSON] is already known aro[ORGANIZATION]d the world, already has immigrants, tourists, and scholars from aro[ORGANIZATION]d the world routinely visiting here. [PERSON] is a hot spot destination for the entire planet. We would be able to alert the world to what [PERSON] just decided for itself with 10 times that amo[ORGANIZATION]t of presence that GPE23 did. If [ORGANIZATION] was not willing to at least start negotiations with [PERSON] after [PERSON]ns expressed their will - then [PERSON] would simply appeal to the international comm[ORGANIZATION]ity to constantly remind [ORGANIZATION] that while they claim to be a democracy, they dont respect the will of the people. [PERSON]ns invented modern day marketing, and social media, and the internet - we would know how to get the word out to the entire planet in a [STREET] that any nation that [ORGANIZATION] ever talked to - we would bring up the point why dont you let those [PERSON]ns be free? Over time [ORGANIZATION] would get tired of constantly having to answer the question and having its global reputation shrink and would realize that it would be better for its global image to at least start negotiations with the elected leaders of [PERSON]. Thats not the end state for secession - but at that point [PERSON] has essentially achieved the success level of GPE25 - which is the world leader in secession - for now. PERSON5 The cultural, demographic, and economic rationales youve mentioned for [PERSON]s secession are compelling. Your [PERSON] Blue Book4 tends to heavily focus on the financial reasons for a divorce from the GPE26. There is a pretty clear moral case for leaving, too, as an independent [PERSON] would send shockwaves worldwide, and could help people aro[ORGANIZATION]d the world fight for ecological restoration, promote social justice issues, and put a dent in [ORGANIZATION]s murderous foreign policy. Where does Yes[PERSON] stand on international relations? Would an independent [PERSON]n nation be able to stand on its own in an increasingly multipolar world, without the help of GPE27? [ORGANIZATION] Great question - this gets at the heart of why [PERSON]ns deserve to be a separate nation seen by the world as truly independent from [ORGANIZATION]. Weve talked about good reasons why it is logical for [PERSON] to secede - aka that life would be better in [PERSON] - but the strongest point of this movement is that [PERSON] deserves to be independent - and the reason for that is that [PERSON]ns are f[ORGANIZATION]damentally a different culture from [ORGANIZATION]ns. For example - the largest protest against the Vietnam War were in [PERSON]. The largest protests against the [PERSON]1 war - [PERSON] later, anywhere in [ORGANIZATION] - were also in [PERSON]. ORG28 institute based in [ORGANIZATION] began ORG29-[ORGANIZATION]n Exchange Program which was the first program of [ORGANIZATION]ns starting to reach out to ORG29 [ORGANIZATION] from anywhere in the 50 states of [ORGANIZATION] to say - hey lets talk and be friends. These [PERSON]ns did this because they opposed the cold warnuclear standoff between the GPE26SR and the [PERSON]5. So when it comes to war - [PERSON]ns consistently over DATE25 have been opposed to the wars that a majority of regular [ORGANIZATION]ns supported. [PERSON]ns recognized the Armenian genocide a while ago - [ORGANIZATION] still has not recognized that genocide occurred. [PERSON] also pursued making sure that survivors of the Holocaust were able to get their money out of insurance companies who took it during WWII - [ORGANIZATION] did not think of the idea of making sure Jewish victims of the Holocaust received money stolen from them - [PERSON]ns did. And [ORGANIZATION] actually struck down the [PERSON]s Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief Act of DATE26 and prevented [ORGANIZATION] from acting on this new law. [PERSON]ns invented [ORGANIZATION] regulation in DATE27 and the laws spread to the rest of [ORGANIZATION] after [ORGANIZATION] figured out how to create laws and the necessary infrastructure to clean the air. Then in DATE28 [ORGANIZATION] did this with [ORGANIZATION] - when the entire rest of the world could not figure out how to actually move on dealing with [ORGANIZATION] in a real legal framework. [ORGANIZATION]ns still debate publicly if [ORGANIZATION] is real. So when we look at being opposed to wars, helping victims, recognizing atrocities, moving to protect the [PERSON]2 - you see [PERSON]ns acting very differently than [ORGANIZATION]ns. I am sure there is more that [PERSON]ns could have done on these issues - but in comparison to [ORGANIZATION] it is clear - that there is an inherent long living culture of [PERSON] that has f[ORGANIZATION]damentally different views on the most important issues of the time - in comparison to [ORGANIZATION]. Yes [ORGANIZATION] points to that to show how [PERSON] would be different talk advocate act differently than [ORGANIZATION] to the world if it was independent. A world where there is a separate [PERSON] would be one where one of the largest economies in the world was bringing up the right stance on key issues with more energy than the [PERSON]0 or the [PERSON]5. As far as the near future is concerned - namely that the era of [ORGANIZATION]n being the lone super power is coming to an end, and DATE29 where there will be possibly up to 5 other governments with as much money and power - aka [ORGANIZATION]power status as [ORGANIZATION] - Yes [ORGANIZATION] believes without any doubt that [PERSON] would do much better in this future by itself - than being associated with [ORGANIZATION]. The world does not like [ORGANIZATION] despite what you may have been told in [ORGANIZATION]n news. The entire planet was scared by the [ORGANIZATION]n invasion of [PERSON]1 in [ORGANIZATION]0, the collapse of the entire world economic system by [ORGANIZATION]n greed and lack of government review in [ORGANIZATION]1 and then again by the spying on the entire globe, including allies, in the [LOCATION]2s, and the invasion and destabilization of [PERSON]2 also aro[ORGANIZATION]d the same time. The invasion of [PERSON]1 and [PERSON]2 were not in keeping with the will and trust of the [ORGANIZATION] and collapsing the economy due to your worst motivations and literally spying on everyone, just terrifies the entire planets population. They see a [ORGANIZATION] power who does whatever it wants to anyone at any time and who does not listen to international law. Fact is that [ORGANIZATION] for as much as it talks about respecting international laws did not do so in [PERSON]2, and [PERSON]1, and is not part of [PERSON]0 - so it cant be tried for war crimes. [ORGANIZATION]ns dont see any of this because it is not reported on - but the world is not dumb, they know exactly what is going on. [PERSON] was recently attacked by terrorists in [PERSON]3 because of its association with [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] also loses a lot of money in lost technology sales because the world does not want to own technology products produced by [ORGANIZATION] because they think they will be spied on. [ORGANIZATION]n President [PERSON] made the mess, but [PERSON] did not fix it and also made messes. Its been [ORGANIZATION]3 and the world has not changed its opinion on [ORGANIZATION]. Yes [ORGANIZATION] believes that the world is never going to change its opinion on [ORGANIZATION]. So the best thing is to pursue a future where [ORGANIZATION] is always a partner to [ORGANIZATION] but is able to be seen as something on its own - who does not necessarily agree with [ORGANIZATION] - much the [STREET] [PERSON]4 is [ORGANIZATION]4. [PERSON]4 works with [ORGANIZATION] but makes sure it is seen differently by the world. Its safer for [PERSON] in the long term to be able to have the insulation that [PERSON]4 uses [ORGANIZATION]4 now. We also think that the new superpowers would have a better relationship with [PERSON] - where more trade, and people and ideas moving back and forth, and peace occurred if it was seen as separate from [ORGANIZATION]. Fact is that the number one [STREET] for investment from aro[ORGANIZATION]d the world is [PERSON] - more foreign people want to invest in [PERSON] than any other [STREET] in 50 states of the [PERSON]5 or the rest of the world. The number one [STREET] where foreign people want to send their children to study at a [ORGANIZATION] is [PERSON]. The first meeting between the leader of [PERSON]3 and [ORGANIZATION]n President [PERSON] was in [PERSON] - because the Chinese requested it. [PERSON]6s Prime Minister PERSON11 visited [PERSON] personally and then remained close friends with the [ORGANIZATION] governor at the time. [PERSON]4s entire technology economy is based on linkages to [PERSON]3 in [PERSON]. The [STREET] in the entire Western hemisphere with the highest amo[ORGANIZATION]t of [PERSON]6n immigrants from South [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]6 is [PERSON]. [PERSON] has already signed direct deals with [PERSON]5 and [PERSON]3. So when we look at who the new superpowers will be - [PERSON]4, [PERSON]3, [PERSON]5, [PERSON]6, and a group of Southeast [PERSON]6n nations - we can see that all of the potential super powers all have their own warm relations and thoughts and prominent connections to [PERSON] - already. An independent [ORGANIZATION] would be able to only improve these relations. Its worth noting that the location that the [PERSON]2 wanted the [ORGANIZATION] to be placed in originally was [PERSON]8[PERSON]. The world said that they preferred this location. The [ORGANIZATION]n government decided to go against [PERSON]2 opinion and [STREET] the [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]7 next to GPE27 DC - that is the only reason the [ORGANIZATION] is not in [PERSON] now.[PERSON] will always be connected as a family member to [ORGANIZATION]. But [ORGANIZATION] is in a dangerous [STREET] because of its behavior and character. It is dangerous for [PERSON]s security and economy to continue to stay as connected to [ORGANIZATION] as it has been. Also there is every reason to believe that all of the emerging [ORGANIZATION] Powers would want to connect even more to [PERSON] once it had seceded from the [PERSON]5. Given that [PERSON] has always been against war - Yes [ORGANIZATION] believes that an independent [ORGANIZATION] would be seen as someone who wants to encourage and secure peace. [PERSON] would always been seen by all of the [ORGANIZATION] Powers as constantly pushing for dialogue and peaceful relations among - the total set of [ORGANIZATION] Powers - [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]3, [PERSON]6, [PERSON]5, [PERSON]4, [PERSON]1. As [PERSON]s governor says [PERSON]ns are about building bridges. We think we would have this reputation among the new [ORGANIZATION] Powers and because of that we could increase the amo[ORGANIZATION]t of dialogue between the [ORGANIZATION] Powers and increase the amo[ORGANIZATION]t of pressure to always come to a peaceful resolution among them also. They already know our reputation - and frankly [ORGANIZATION] could use a family member who is liked by the [PERSON]2 saying - hey keep talking to [ORGANIZATION] and working toward a peaceful resolution. This is why Yes [ORGANIZATION] believes allowing [PERSON] secession will be in [ORGANIZATION]s long term security interest - it is not liked, and the people who dont like it are only getting stronger, [ORGANIZATION] needs a popular cousin to smooth over the wrinkles [ORGANIZATION] has created and to ensure that people dont fully hate or gang up on [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] seems to be doing a horrible job at improving its world image on its own. This overall concept is the main point of my book [PERSON]s Next Century 2.0. Yes [ORGANIZATION] fo[ORGANIZATION]d me from reading about this book and that is why I work with them [ORGANIZATION]4.If the world wants to make sure that the superpowers dont go to war or fight each other but focus on working together, especially during this very tense period where the new superpowers are rising to the size of the older ones - then it should definitely [ORGANIZATION]leash [PERSON] to help provide some pressure on all of them. This is the main reason Yes [ORGANIZATION] says that [PERSON] secession is good for the security of the entire planet. PERSON5 I can imagine there would be legitimate concerns from the other 49 states, and progressives, that a [PERSON] would push the rest of GPE26 further to the right politically. Also, there would be plenty of swirling rumors and questions about an independent [PERSON] cozying up to [PERSON]3 and [PERSON]9. How would you respond to this, and can you explain your theory about how [PERSON] could become a New GPE40 with regard to neutrality and international diplomacy? [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]s electoral votes havent affected a presidential election since [ORGANIZATION]5. Every [ORGANIZATION]n presidential election since that time was decided before the [PERSON] votes were co[ORGANIZATION]ted. Watch how the DATE21 election is decided before the [PERSON] votes are co[ORGANIZATION]ted - again. This frustrates [PERSON]ns and proves our point - as the largest state of 50 states, the [PERSON] vote should be decisive but it is not. [ORGANIZATION]6 - PERSON12 told [PERSON] supporters that it didnt matter if he won [PERSON] in a [PERSON]3 primary election because she had enough votes anyways. The [PERSON]7 [PERSON]6s in [ORGANIZATION]7 in an article by PERSON14 pointed out that the vote of [PERSON] is virtually insignificant. There would be a loss of liberal support in [ORGANIZATION] if [ORGANIZATION] was independent but I dont think the impact would be that dramatic given that [ORGANIZATION] has been rendered irrelevant for [ORGANIZATION]8 in how votes turn out in [ORGANIZATION]n federal elections. [PERSON] worked out what is essentially a trade deal with [PERSON]9 and a treaty on climate change in [PERSON]3 - they were called memorandums of [ORGANIZATION]derstanding and high level talks because technically only the [ORGANIZATION]n President can agree to trade deals and treaties but the negotiations between [ORGANIZATION] and these nations is exactly the same thing in deed. [PERSON] has been close to most of the worlds cultures and nations in a [STREET] that far exceeds what [ORGANIZATION]ns are willing to do. For example Governor PERSON15 recently wrote an essay asking for [PERSON]6 and [ORGANIZATION] to continue dialogue. No other governor did that. [ORGANIZATION]ns look at this and think it is weird - but for [PERSON]ns it is who we are, as our Governor said, [PERSON]ns build bridges while [ORGANIZATION]ns build walls. [ORGANIZATION]ns will definitely find the behavior of an independent [ORGANIZATION] strange - just as [ORGANIZATION] thinks [PERSON] as a state is strange. This proves the point of why [ORGANIZATION] cant stay part of [ORGANIZATION] - we are not the same culture. [PERSON] is incredibly linked to the international economy, has the highest amo[ORGANIZATION]t of immigrants and foreign tongues spoken [ORGANIZATION]9 in every comm[ORGANIZATION]ity - being full of immigrants and surro[ORGANIZATION]ded by people who speak a language other than English is just strange to [ORGANIZATION]ns - but it is normal life literally everywhere in [PERSON]. For example - immigrants are about 10 of the [ORGANIZATION]n population - whereas in [PERSON] they are 30. [ORGANIZATION] trade is linked to the 13 of the [ORGANIZATION]n economy, whereas in [PERSON] it is linked to almost 12. [PERSON] has a f[ORGANIZATION]damentally different relationship with the foreign world and as Yes [PERSON] says [PERSON]ns will definitely act more like themselves when they are not held back by [ORGANIZATION]n xenophobia any longer. It is key to recognize that the [STREET] that [PERSON] relates to the foreign world is the [STREET] that [ORGANIZATION]ns should act. [ORGANIZATION] should be closer to other nations, have more immigrants, know more about the foreign world, share the opinions of foreign nations, sign more trade deals and treaties - but currently it is not in [ORGANIZATION]ns character to act like this. [ORGANIZATION]ns are having a huge debate right now as seen in the [ORGANIZATION]n president elections on how connected to the foreign world the [PERSON]5 should be, and how open to immigration it should be. However in an increasingly internationally connected world - where connections to other nations are the life blood of a nations economic strength and one where [ORGANIZATION] will be surro[ORGANIZATION]ded by powers that are equal in size to it - for the first time in [PERSON]0 - being more connected, and acting more like [PERSON]s culture is key to [ORGANIZATION]s survival and ability to remain strong in the upcoming future. Since it appears [ORGANIZATION]ns arent up to this - it is up to [PERSON] to do it for them - to reach out to the world - to make connections and then connect [ORGANIZATION] to those connections. This is why we say [PERSON] independence is key to [ORGANIZATION]s national security for the long term. [PERSON] will do what [ORGANIZATION] needs to do - connect better to the foreign world - and because [ORGANIZATION] will always be a family partner to [ORGANIZATION] it will be able to lessen the global tension aimed at [ORGANIZATION] and improve the good relations that [ORGANIZATION] can be part of. In my book [PERSON]s Next Century 2.0 the idea that [PERSON] could be the new GPE40 for [PERSON]1 - directly comes from this concept above. Besides being able to relate [ORGANIZATION] to the rest of the world - [PERSON] can relate the rest of the world to any superpower. This globally [ORGANIZATION]ique ability provides a [ORGANIZATION]ique opport[ORGANIZATION]ity just for [PERSON]. When [PERSON]an co[ORGANIZATION]tries owned the entire world [ORGANIZATION]der colonialism - the dialogue headquarters for [PERSON] and therefore the world was in GPE40. First with [PERSON]5 and then with GPE20 - which keeps a second headquarters there in addition to the one in [LOCATION], and even before the league of nations many international treaties between [PERSON]s nations were signed at this central location. This central hub for discussion worked well for the world when the world was literally almost totally owned by [PERSON]an nations. GPE40 is a nation that is made up of many cultures - French, German, Italian, and early on the Swiss mandated that all school children be able to speak English. So GPE40 was a nation - that [ORGANIZATION]derstood French, German, Italian, English cultures and languages and people - and was the living example of all of these people living together in peace. The Swiss were the best at getting the different [PERSON]an nations to dialogue and reach an agreement - because they really [ORGANIZATION]derstood all of the different [PERSON]an cultures and werent biased against any one group - their goal was always to get people to agree - because it was who they are as a people - one culture from many living peacefully and very productively. The world has changed and now [PERSON] does not own or control the world. The world is going to fall into competing spheres of regional control - with each region controlled or influenced by the [ORGANIZATION] Power of that part of the globe - South [ORGANIZATION] by [PERSON]5, [PERSON]6 by [PERSON]3, South [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]6 by [PERSON]4 and by [PERSON]1, [ORGANIZATION]ern [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]6 by [PERSON]6, the Middle [ORGANIZATION] and North [PERSON] by [PERSON], Latin [ORGANIZATION] and the LOC22 by [ORGANIZATION]. Therefore a global center for dialogue located in [PERSON] like GPE40, or in predominantly [PERSON]an heritage created city like [PERSON]7, does not make sense for this new emerging world order. The question then becomes what [STREET] in the world has all of these superpowers cultures living together, with their languages intact, and practicing their cultures, but in a [STREET] that melds them together and that already has a reputation for world dialogue and always pushing for peace. In the book I review the entire planet and prove that only [PERSON] has all of these characteristics - in one [STREET] - anywhere in the world. There just arent that many places that have all of these cultures living together, still practicing their separate cultures, but living together in a productive [STREET]. Add to that having a good global reputation - where the entire world already knows who you are and has an idea of what you are about and feels positively about you - and the list of contenders shrinks to just [PERSON]. [PERSON] is the most diverse [STREET] in the world, and has peoples from all of the superpowers already living together. [PERSON] already showed that it can by itself create world dialogue on a major problem - when it got the world to agree to the first climate change legislation. [PERSON] had many nations fly to [PERSON] and engage in a mini-[ORGANIZATION] style dialogue and created the first attempt at dealing with an issue the [PERSON]5, [PERSON]0, [ORGANIZATION] all felt was too complicated to even attempt to tackle. [PERSON]3 and GPE42 have both recognized that [PERSON] appears to be a separate nation form [ORGANIZATION] when it comes to [ORGANIZATION]. The entire world saw the protests in [ORGANIZATION] against the [PERSON]1 war and noted that the majority of the protest was in [ORGANIZATION] alone. [PERSON] also already has global recognition of a [ORGANIZATION]ique [PERSON] brand - meaning a [STREET] of life, and culture that is different and distinct from [ORGANIZATION]n culture and is thought positively about aro[ORGANIZATION]d the world. It is true that GPE40 had no major [PERSON]an powers stationing an army in its borders, and had a long history of neutrality before it became a negotiation center - but we feel that given the benefits that [PERSON] already has [ORGANIZATION]4 - that it could - with a public declaration of independence - be able to convince the world to see it as the new GPE40 for the emerging world order. We think the world would be open to this - because the old world order and international legal institutions are seen as been created by and for [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, the [PERSON]2 Bank, [PERSON]0 are all seen as being primarily f[ORGANIZATION]ded, and staffed and usually advocating for [ORGANIZATION]n [PERSON]an interests. Because of this [PERSON]5 has made its own international dialogue center, [PERSON]9, [PERSON]3 and [PERSON]6 work together on [LOCATION]0, and [PERSON]1 and [PERSON]4 also have created their own leagues for international dialogue. These rising superpowers dont have faith that the international infrastructure will open up and include them to the point that they will be effectively [ORGANIZATION]biased against them anymore and will treat them on equal footing with [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. It is clear by the energy that [PERSON]5, [PERSON]6, [PERSON]3, [PERSON]4, [PERSON]1 put into their own organizations that they arent betting on the [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION]1, [PERSON]2 Bank, [LOCATION]3 being neutral enough for them. Rather than have competition international dialogue centers - to the point that there is no central [STREET] for discussion but rather multiple tables where no one ever sits and talks to each other at one big table any more - [PERSON] can become a new [ORGANIZATION] - the new center for international dialogue. We believe that with Independence [ORGANIZATION] has a real chance at reaching out to the new superpowers and asking them to recognize [ORGANIZATION] as the new world dialogue center - for the reasons stated before, and because the first [ORGANIZATION] was supposed to be located in [PERSON] - the world wanted [ORGANIZATION] as the site for the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] disagreed with world opinion - and that is the only reason the [ORGANIZATION] is not in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]4. We also feel that if [ORGANIZATION] cant pull this off - then no one can. There is no next best option for a new dialogue center - [ORGANIZATION] is the only realistic option. If [ORGANIZATION] does not become a new dialogue center for the new superpowers and the rest of the world then we expect the pulling away from international institutions set up by [PERSON]5 ... to simply continue to the point that the world enters a prolonged period of chaos. This is why Yes [ORGANIZATION] states that it is in the interest of everyone in the world to make [ORGANIZATION] independent - so world peace can be insured. PERSON5 Speaking of [LOCATION]4, heres something to think about. In [PERSON]2 the Swiss people voted on a referendum for a [ORGANIZATION]iversal basic income, however, it was badly defeated. A cursory glance at the numbers in [PERSON], with about 2.5 trillion GDP and 40 million people, could provide 62,500 per year for each man, woman, and child. Income inequality in [PERSON] is rising [LOCATION]4, with endemic poverty affecting millions. There are many other social and environmental justice issues threatening to explode into full-blown crises in the state. How could a new [PERSON]n nation tackle such problems as amnesty and a speedy path to citizenship for [ORGANIZATION]documented workers, renewable energy projects, high [ORGANIZATION]employment, and gentrification due to rising real estate prices? [ORGANIZATION] Lets take the issues one by one. Immigration - Yes [ORGANIZATION] is very pleased that we have already been covered in the news for our radical immigration reform plan. We figured out how to use existing [ORGANIZATION] law to allow for the millions of [ORGANIZATION]documented [PERSON]ns to be able to achieve first class citizenship in [PERSON]. It was the called the [PERSON] Immigration Reform Act and it was covered by the [ORGANIZATION] Business [PERSON]6s, and [LOCATION]5 which also gave PERSON16, the President of Yes [PERSON], the title of [LOCATION]7Trump for proposing this law. A Spanish language TV station news show gave the leader of Yes [PERSON] that title. Yes [PERSON] was called Sovereign [PERSON] at this time - we changed our name - but it is the same organization. We figured out that there is an existing law in [ORGANIZATION] where [ORGANIZATION]documented people can register with the [PERSON] department of motor vehicles and receive a drivers license. This license is only good in [PERSON] and cant be used outside of [ORGANIZATION]. Also part of that law is a provision that information that the government of [ORGANIZATION] collects about [ORGANIZATION]documented immigrants would not be shared with the federal government - at all - even if they ask. This law has not been struck down, although it has been criticized. This act was nothing less than [PERSON] saying legally that it will not work with federal authorities on immigration, and that it will do what it feels is best for its people - regardless of how the ORG6 government feels, or if it is legal [ORGANIZATION]der federal law. Only the federal government can deal with immigration issues - and people without immigration papers - but [PERSON] completely ignored that. Yes [ORGANIZATION] realized that this was the opening of [ORGANIZATION]. If drivers licenses can be provided - aka service can be provided by the [PERSON] department of motor vehicles - and this law was not struck down - then what is to prevent every [PERSON] government office from providing services to the millions of [ORGANIZATION]documented [PERSON]ns? The [PERSON] Immigration Reform Act expands what happened at the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]3 to all agencies of the [ORGANIZATION] Republic. Yes [ORGANIZATION] did a survey and we fo[ORGANIZATION]d very few things that the ORG6 government has an agency for, overlooking and providing regulation on - that [PERSON] doesnt have its own agency for. [PERSON] has a government office for everything. There is overlap on almost everything that the ORG6 government does in [PERSON] - with a separate [PERSON] agency. For example - there is [ORGANIZATION]1 and [PERSON]l [ORGANIZATION]1 - who both oversee worker safety. Given this infrastructure it was possible that [PERSON] could provide full citizenship to all of the [ORGANIZATION]documented - full services for everything that a person would need in [ORGANIZATION] society - as long as we continued to ignore the fact that the ORG6 government controls all immigration issues - which [ORGANIZATION] already did when it allowed [PERSON] [PERSON]ns to get [ORGANIZATION]3 licenses. The initiative didnt pass - we were just starting out and were much smaller then than [ORGANIZATION]4 - and we didnt have the publicly to get attention to the fact that an option was available to pull literally millions of people who live as second class citizens in [PERSON] - because of federal law - out of that situation. But this law is a perfect example of what could be done if [PERSON] was independent. The federal government controls the borders - and [PERSON] has the highest amo[ORGANIZATION]t of [ORGANIZATION]documented people anywhere in 50 states, and the ORG6 government controls immigration - which it has not reformed in [PERSON]3. [PERSON] has the most [ORGANIZATION]documented people - and yet has to wait for the federal government to pass immigration reform and deal with the massive flow of [ORGANIZATION]documented people in [PERSON]. The federal system does not work - and [PERSON] suffers. If [ORGANIZATION] could do immigration on its own - there would be a workable immigration system that would secure borders - but allow millions of people a chance at a better life at the same time - almost instantly. [PERSON]ns would not wait to figure out how to deal with immigration and [ORGANIZATION]documented immigration - it would recognize all of the people already in [PERSON] and it would create a [STREET] to have a much more workable system for allowing new people into [PERSON] from Latin [ORGANIZATION], by working with Latin [ORGANIZATION]n governments - than exists [ORGANIZATION]4. Renewable Energy projects, Lack of affordable housing, poor schooling results, and the catastrophic drought in [PERSON] are all results from a lack of infrastructure development in [PERSON] over [PERSON]4. When [PERSON] PERSON15 was Governor of [ORGANIZATION] - he built modern [PERSON] as we know it [ORGANIZATION]4. He convinced the [ORGANIZATION] people to borrow money and raise taxes to pay for a transportation system, a [ORGANIZATION]iversity system, a water system and many other massive infrastructure projects that would provide for incredible growth in [PERSON] for [PERSON] into the future. Since his time - [PERSON] has built nothing, basically nothing at all. Starting in [PERSON]5 [PERSON] stopped building major infrastructure - yet the population has more than doubled. If you built a home for 4 people - and then 8 people lived in the home, but you built no more bedrooms, bathrooms, sinks, showers, electrical lines - that home would being to completely fall apart and turn into a shanty. It was a good home - but now it looks like a shanty - because you did not expand infrastructure for that home - although you doubled the population. Thats the situation in [PERSON] - it has not built major education facilities - there was one [ORGANIZATION]4 campus built in [PERSON]6, it has not built new water ways or dams, or hydro-electric facilities, or desalination facilities powered by solar power, or major affordable housing tracts or major improvements to the electrical grid - like massive solar powered farms, wind farms along the coast, wave power farms along the sea, [ORGANIZATION] thermal plants, or anything like this in [PERSON]. Some infrastructure has been built - but not like when [PERSON] had a governor like [PERSON] PERSON15. The high speed rail project is the biggest - [PERSON] PERSON15 like - infrastructure project [ORGANIZATION] has done in [PERSON]. You dont have water systems, education systems, power, housing and all of the other type of infrastructure built up to handle increased stress - and no wonder that life for the majority of [PERSON]ns is not as good as it was during DATE51 - which was right after [PERSON] PERSON15 finished building all of this infrastructure and it was brand new and only allowed for massive growth. [PERSON] is a donor state, and pays more into the federal system than it gets out in services. It has done this for [PERSON]. The typical amo[ORGANIZATION]t lost - according to calculations by Yes [ORGANIZATION] is about 16 Billion - but [PERSON]7 it could be as high as 30 Billion. [PERSON] also is losing money in technology sales - which is a huge part of the [ORGANIZATION] economy - because foreign people dont want to buy things associated with [ORGANIZATION] - the loss of this market is in the Billions. This was documented in a study by [ORGANIZATION]5 in [PERSON]8. [PERSON] routinely has trade deals stalled by the ORG6 government for [PERSON]9 because while [ORGANIZATION] is very connected to the international economy and willing to work with anyone, the ORG6 government is more interested in using trade as a weapon to intimidate foreign nations. Because of intrigue on the part of the ORG6 government - [PERSON] loses billions in trade deals that take DATE50 to pass. This was documented in the book Global [PERSON] by Professor PERSON18 of the [ORGANIZATION] of Southern [PERSON]. When you add all this up - Yes [ORGANIZATION] estimates [ORGANIZATION] is loses somewhere between 16 - 60 Billion dollars a year by being associated with the federal government. And this has gone on for [PERSON]. That kind of money is as we say [ORGANIZATION]. Give or get out of the [STREET] and allow [ORGANIZATION] to get - that kind of money and we can improve this infrastructure now - and literally life for all of the middle class and lower middle class people would be dramatically improved over [TIME]. Not every problem would be fixed, but all [PERSON]ns agree that life was better during DATE51 - roughly DATE52 - when all of the infrastructure that [PERSON]s [PERSON] PERSON15 created was fresh and more than provided for everyones needs. This also gets to the issue of high [ORGANIZATION]employment and [ORGANIZATION]equal wages. [PERSON] is possibly the worst [STREET] for [ORGANIZATION]equal pay aka the [PERSON] coefficient - meaning the gap between what the wealthy and upper income makes and what lower middle class makes. The recession caused by Wall [STREET] bankers in [ORGANIZATION] decimated good working class jobs in [PERSON], and we are still totally struggling to come out of it. [PERSON] improved its economy with the technology industry - which provides very high salaries and employs many people - but which requires highly skilled educated workers only. If you are not highly educated or have advanced high skills - there is no job for you. That is the problem in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]4. [ORGANIZATION] used to have a large air plane manufacturing industry that employed many blue collar jobs - but that left [ORGANIZATION] in [DATE]. The dot com economy picked up a lot of the slack in [ORGANIZATION]0 and eased that transition - but then the recession in DATE54 happened and reset [PERSON] back. [PERSON] needs blue collar jobs - jobs where people only need a high school diploma, and can learn on the job - and become highly skilled on the job. The last great industry that employs primarily blue collar laborers and provides long term careers and the ability to grow in pay with increased on the job learned skills - is trade. Truck drivers between sea ports, sea [INSTITUTION] workers, container operators, ship drivers, logistics managers, people who work sorting goods in warehouses - those are all stable, good blue collar jobs that would pull the mass of [PERSON]ns who are struggling to find a minimum wage job - a good career wage that pays aro[ORGANIZATION]d 60,000 a year - because the market is willing to pay that, not because the government ordered businesses to pay it. If minimum wage needs to be raised then so be it - but no one thinks that forcing the minimum wage to be raised is a better option than having an economy that naturally prefers to pay high wages to workers. [PERSON] international trade - [ORGANIZATION]leash [PERSON]. Disassociate the world renowned horrible image of [ORGANIZATION] from [PERSON] products - as [ORGANIZATION]7 computers already does when it says made in [PERSON] instead of made in [ORGANIZATION]. Allow [PERSON] to act on trade with other nations - at the speed that it can handle it - not the much slower speed of a dysf[ORGANIZATION]ctional federal government. Let [PERSON] keep the money it sends to GPE27 that it receives nothing for - and we can invest in infrastructure and grow international trade and grow the [ORGANIZATION] economy and provide for a massive increase in blue collar jobs - which will raise literally millions of poor and [ORGANIZATION]deremployed [PERSON]ns to stable, sustainable, middle class living standards and end the massive gap between rich and poor in [ORGANIZATION] that exists [ORGANIZATION]4 because of [ORGANIZATION]n greed in Wall [STREET]. The world respected economist PERSON19 pointed out in his book The Competitive Advantage of Nations that every nation that provides good jobs for its entire people has first class infrastructure - there is no economy that does well - that does not have first class infrastructure. [ORGANIZATION] no longer has first class infrastructure - which includes education to transportation infrastructure - this is the main reason that there arent good jobs for everyone. By the [STREET], PERSON20 also said that no economy that does well is not able to move as efficiently as possible at moving on new international trade deals - meaning that [ORGANIZATION] is also not able to provide as many jobs as it can - because it has to go through a bloated federal bureaucracy to get approval. PERSON5 Its been quite interesting reading your own book, your groups [PERSON] blue book, some of the media attention on your Facebook page, and talking privately with you. On one hand, youre taking a revolutionary stance, openly calling for secession, an end to poverty and discrimination, etc. On the other, some of your rhetoric is [ORGANIZATION]cannily similar to a mainstream liberal argument Its the economy, stupid. Your words above [PERSON] international trade- [ORGANIZATION]leash [PERSON]. Ive cautioned you about that approach privately, chided you a little for that financially-focused kind of strategy. Some of your words appear to be no different than the talking points and so[ORGANIZATION]d bites the public hears [ORGANIZATION]9 from our elected representatives, and has grown increasingly numb to. The world needs less capitalism, not more. [PERSON], and any state for that matter, needs to learn to use its immense wealth for comm[ORGANIZATION]ity enrichment, not to grow the economy. Globally, [PERSON]ns are the 1, as are most middle-class [ORGANIZATION]ns, and we all need to give back. The public wants to know about how to solve issues closest to their hearts how to provide a good education for their children and grandchildren, how to generate energy without fossil fuels, how to produce healthy, affordable food, how to promote peace among nations, how to change our lifestyles and crush our addictions to materialism and primitive entertainment. How we can personally and spiritually transform ourselves. You brought up [ORGANIZATION]7, in a sort of positive light, so Im going to bo[ORGANIZATION]ce off that. We dont need any more laptops or iPhone apps. The [PERSON]3 venture, ahem, vulture capitalists, the PERSON21, the PERSON22, the PERSON23 of the world, these are very dangerous people, PERSON24. They are in bed with Wall [STREET], [ORGANIZATION]8, the [ORGANIZATION]9, and GPE43. They are the status quo, and they wont give up your state without a fight. To battle these people you need a grassroots movement, you need to promote international solidarity and brotherhood with all nations, to offer to help poor nations develop their economies. Using domestic economic arguments will only take you so far. How is your group working to develop a philosophy that transcends capitalist ideology? Are you planning a broad-based strategy and platform for citizens of all creeds and colors to get behind, to ward off any possible neo-feudal usurpers who would be desperate to stop your movement from coalescing? Are you starting to [ORGANIZATION]derstand the need for public education of [PERSON]n adults, and the need for the [ORGANIZATION]-learning of our cultures indoctrination? [ORGANIZATION] First I want to point out that we do feel that we are addressing reaching out to all creeds and colors. However, we are always open to ideas on what more could be done - no one in Yes [ORGANIZATION] pretends that we have it all figured out. We work on what we do have figured out and - always - always ask people what are we missing - and then move on that. Yes [ORGANIZATION] was one of the first organizations in [ORGANIZATION] to publicly endorse [PERSON]mpaign Zero which is the [LOCATION] platform for how to change society so that [PERSON]n [ORGANIZATION]ns are treated fairly in all aspects of society. We already stood for that - and did it when it first came out - and were one of the few organizations to do that, that early. Our President, PERSON16, when he ran for ORG61 - stood outside of police stations and talked about police reform against brutality. Thats on video and we posted it proudly. To our knowledge no other politician has taken this public and radical a stance on directly challenging the police to reform. Yes [ORGANIZATION] already proposed a plan to make [ORGANIZATION]documented people who are primarily Latino have a real [STREET] to not be second class citizens. To date we have not seen any other organization even suggest that [ORGANIZATION] take care of the millions of Latinos and Chinese descent [PERSON]ns who are living as second class citizens - on its own or present a plan to do so. To date we are the only group in [PERSON] who has presented a real plan to help these people. Yes [ORGANIZATION] also pointed out that [PERSON] gives more money to the federal system than it gets back and that this money goes from the federal government primarily to governments in the Southern part of the [PERSON]5 and LOC23LOC24 - where people are racists and homophobic. On our [PERSON], we have [ORGANIZATION] people saying they like what Yes [ORGANIZATION] is doing, because they dont want their tax money going to support people who hate the [ORGANIZATION] comm[ORGANIZATION]ity. To date we are the only group pointing out that the federal government subsidizes people who hate [ORGANIZATION] people - and at least starting the conversation that this should stop. Yes [ORGANIZATION] was the only organization to point out that in [PERSON]6 [ORGANIZATION] did not get its fair share of [ORGANIZATION] f[ORGANIZATION]ding - it got half. Meaning all of the children who live in poverty - got half of what they were promised by the federal government from the official f[ORGANIZATION]d designed to help homeless children. The main source of f[ORGANIZATION]ding designed to help homeless children in 50 states - [ORGANIZATION] got half and almost no other organizations even bothered to mention this. To date we have not seen any other organization in [PERSON] bring this up. Finally, Yes [PERSON] has said from the beginning and in the loudest [STREET] possible that the main reason [ORGANIZATION] is a different [STREET] than the [PERSON]5 is because it is the most diverse [STREET] in the planet - and that this world class diversity is key to our culture. We celebrate that, yell it out and have done so from the beginning. Why was Yes [ORGANIZATION] first among so many other organizations, politicians, activists, well-meaning people - in supporting [PERSON]mpaign Zero, providing a plan to help millions of Latino come out of second class citizenship, plan to not help governments that support intolerance against [ORGANIZATION] people, highlight how the Children in poverty are not treated fairly. We think it is because Yes [ORGANIZATION] is about supporting diversity inherently. Our actions speak very loudly we feel. Could we do more - absolutely and are always open to more ideas. Are we doing more than other organizations out there - we feel yes, and point to these acts as proof. How can [PERSON] provide higher quality education for its children? To me, it is a question of money. [PERSON] has the loLOC24 per pupil spending of all 50 states, except for GPE44 which is dead last. This means that [ORGANIZATION] spends less on its children in public education than 48 states. Spending more on the kids has at least something dramatic to do with providing more quality education. The same [ORGANIZATION]derstanding applies we feel to moving off fossil fuels. [PERSON] is at the fore front of research into alternative energy - being among the first places to set up wind farms, massive solar farms, and one of very few places in the planet to try out wave energy. However, moving beyond research to actually having energy that is renewable and can supply the needs of the population requires investment. You have to buy and build more solar panels, wind power generators, wave power generators. That comes down to money to build this technology. I dont know of a [STREET] to provide alternative energy in a [STREET] that can get society off fossil fuels without massive construction of alternative energy facilities - which requires money. Even if people were willing to vol[ORGANIZATION]teer the effort - at some point you have to hire engineers because these are technically sophisticated machines, and you would have to buy the steel and wires to construct them. Having more money in the [ORGANIZATION] economy - means more money can be spent on children in schools - which will have a dramatic impact and means we can create an alternative power infrastructure. The only other [STREET] to get this money is to raise taxes on the rich. [ORGANIZATION] already does that - [ORGANIZATION] has the highest taxes on the rich anywhere in the [PERSON]5, and had the highest taxes almost anywhere in the [PERSON]5 already - which predominantly the upper middle class pay. Maybe taxes could be higher - but when comparing [ORGANIZATION] to any other [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION] - we are at the forefront of making the rich pay to provide for the poor already. If we cant get a tax increase on the rich passed - then the only other [STREET] to raise the money to do these things is to grow the economy - which will grow tax revenue without raising taxes. This is the [STREET] you get more money for social programs without having the 1 stand in the path to progress - which, as we all know - they control the system. I also want to point out that money also helps with poverty. [PERSON] has the worst situation when it comes to poverty and homelessness. Recently [PERSON] was ranked 48 out of all 50 states for providing for homeless children. [PERSON] was also recently ranked as have the highest amo[ORGANIZATION]t of adult homelessness, veteran homelessness, and chronically homeless people. [PERSON] pays more into the federal system than it ever gets out - yet - although it has 39 of the chronic homeless population, it only receives 2 of the ORG6 f[ORGANIZATION]ds designed to help this group. Although it has 21 of all of the homeless children, it only gets 11 of the ORG6 f[ORGANIZATION]ds aimed for this group. If helping the homeless and those in dire poverty is important - then [PERSON] has the highest amo[ORGANIZATION]t of need. Yes [ORGANIZATION] does not get its fair share of ORG6 assistance for homelessness - and yet continues to pay more money into the ORG6 system. If [ORGANIZATION] was independent - it would not pay extra ORG6 taxes, that money would stay in [ORGANIZATION] and could go to homeless. If [ORGANIZATION] was able to grow its economy it could increase the amo[ORGANIZATION]t of tax revenue and provide greater services for homeless. To date - no one has provided a plan to deal with the incredible - worst of any [STREET] in all 50 states - homeless crisis in [PERSON] - other than dramatically increase taxes on the rich - and hope that they allow that to happen. The questions youve brought up, of how to produce healthy foods, make sure the public is eating healthier, promote peace among nations, change lifestyles away from a destructive path to a long term sustainable manner, end an addiction on primitive entertainment, upgrade our spiritual being, develop a philosophy that transcends capitalist ideology, create a platform for citizens of all creeds and colors to get behind, create the [ORGANIZATION]derstanding that adults need to be life-long learners, and [ORGANIZATION]plug people from a toxic [ORGANIZATION]n culture are absolutely not about money. The answer to these issues is what we in Yes [ORGANIZATION] call the epiphany. Travel back to DATE55 [ORGANIZATION]. Yes there was racism and sexism and discrimination against many groups and not everyone got to participate in the quality of life at this time. Totally true and there is much to hate about DATE56 - and it was also the time when [ORGANIZATION] really believed in [ORGANIZATION] and believed that they were helping the world. Yes, [ORGANIZATION] was lying to the public and toppling democracies - but I want to focus on how the domestic population of [ORGANIZATION] felt and acted at this time. Children worked hard in school because they wanted to give back. They wanted to be a fireman or police officer, or doctor - for the pure reason of giving back. They didnt say I want to be a doctor to make a wealthy life style -they said they wanted to be a doctor to help people. Comm[ORGANIZATION]ities took care of each other. Doors were left [ORGANIZATION]locked. People donated and vol[ORGANIZATION]teered at levels not seen in recent times. People went to college and then joined [ORGANIZATION] and traveled to a poor nation and lived in poverty to help the people there. Others joined the military because they really felt they were spreading democracy. I know that the image and the reality didnt match - but that belief that you are part of a great society that is literally making the entire world better and so you need to do your part is what we believe can be recreated - in [PERSON] among our [PERSON]ns. [ORGANIZATION] actually achieved this - so we know it is possible to get a society this motivated to help the world - the question is how to recreate that energy  belief again. If [PERSON] was a nation in our current era - it could reach out and connect to the world in a [STREET] that it has never been able to do for DATE57. [PERSON]ns have always protested [ORGANIZATION]ns wars, and they got [ORGANIZATION] to do air quality legal reform and they got the world - by themselves - to actually move to fixing climate change. Yes, I know more can be done - but it was [PERSON] alone that got the world doing whatever it is doing to date for addressing [ORGANIZATION]. The President of the [ORGANIZATION] admitted that. So if [PERSON] is its own nation - it would only advocate more for - less war, more environmental reform. We have that track record - it is who we are - it is how we would talk when independent - but even louder. An independent [PERSON] has the ability to become the negotiation table for the entire world - at a time when the rising powers outside of [PERSON]5[PERSON]0 dont trust the [ORGANIZATION] and other international institutions and are making their own. That is a dangerous pattern the entire world is on. No one has a plan to get everyone back to one table. The [ORGANIZATION][LOCATION]1 and other organizations made by [PERSON]5[PERSON]0 - are not going to be reformed, and if they ever are - it will be when they are so powerless and [ORGANIZATION]popular that it wont matter that they are finally accepting of non-[PERSON]an descent cultures actually r[ORGANIZATION]ning and leading those organizations. [PERSON] is the only [STREET] that could be that central discussion. If [PERSON] does not do this - I dont think anyone will do it. Thats what the book [PERSON]s Next Century 2.0 is all about proving. It just will not get done - and the near future will be one where there are regions that dont negotiation with each other, but have their own separate discussions - which will lead to more international crime, more war crimes, more human rights abuses, more wars, and move the entire world closer to nuclear war. I dont know of another plan to get the world back on track of everyone negotiating at one table. Currently [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and GPE20 big plan - is to act like the world still loves them and is not pulling away from the global institutions they built. That is a plan to allow chaos and if this issue is not fixed in DATE58 - the upcoming [PERSON] will be more violent and repressive and inhumane than anything seen in the last [PERSON]0. The greatest gift that can be given from [ORGANIZATION] to the world is a stable future - without an increase in wars or international crime. That wont happen if a new discussion center is not solidified in DATE58 worth of time. Who else is going to do this? Who else is even talking about this as an issue? Who else has suggested a plan? Other than wait and hope things dont get that bad. That is not a plan for a secure future, not for any of the worlds peoples. If [PERSON] took on the role of being the world discussion center - it would be not just a new industry that created jobs, it would be a calling for all [PERSON]ns. Convincing diverse cultures to get along and work to productive solutions is not just something [PERSON]ns would do - it would be something that they believe in. [PERSON] is the most diverse [STREET] on the planet - but currently [PERSON]ns just think of this as something that is a source of pride. If [PERSON] took on this role - as the new GPE40 for [ORGANIZATION]1 - it would require all schools to train children to be ready for this role, all [ORGANIZATION]iversities to train students to think about how to do this, require all adults to educate themselves to get jobs in this arena, require all politicians to provide motivation to their local comm[ORGANIZATION]ities on supporting this plan. In short - you would have that [ORGANIZATION]n DATE55 belief - that everyone had to do their part to make the world safe. However, instead of the [ORGANIZATION]n concept that spreading democracy is the greatest gift to the [PERSON]2 - [PERSON]s mission to the entire world would be about showing the world that diverse cultures can get along as one people with incredible productivity. You get [PERSON] to be the discussion center for the world - and you will have a calling for all adults, all children - a calling that asks them to not watch TV but learn how to make the world a better [STREET], that asks adults to [ORGANIZATION]learn ideas that make the world more violent and embrace new ways of thinking that bring cultures together - because everyone in [PERSON] will have absorbed the goal that [PERSON]s [STREET] in the world is not just to lead the world but show the world how all cultures can live together. The mere mention that [ORGANIZATION] is going to become the discussion center of the world would send a massive wave of shock and reforms throughout all parts of [PERSON] society to all people, and it would cause [PERSON]s great epiphany. To deal with the question of how do you fight the powers that be that will fight to keep the status quo - the elites who would try to shut this movement all the [STREET] completely down, the answer is that you get them to fight themselves. There is a phrase it takes fire to fight fire - and that applies. What does a rich person want after they become rich? More wealth. It makes no sense but they want it. What about after they have so much wealth it stops being impressive - they want power? What about after they have power - they want fame? That is why you see so many rich people who are powerful and also famous. Fame occurs to be the top desire of the rich - so many billionaires spend their own money on initiatives in [PERSON]. Why do they do this - because it makes them famous - PERSON25, PERSON26, PERSON27, [ORGANIZATION], PERSON29, are just a few examples - of [PERSON]ns who made incredible money and then turned to attempt to alter the political environment specifically in [PERSON]. These people did not put as much effort into changing society anywhere else in 50 states. It did not make them richer to support and advocate for initiatives in [PERSON] - but it did make them famous. You are totally correct that the rich r[ORGANIZATION] things and they have interest in keeping the system exactly how it is - because they are rich in this system and that some of them will stand in the [STREET] of progress. However in [PERSON] the situation is not the normal situation aro[ORGANIZATION]d the world or in [ORGANIZATION]. In [PERSON] the majority of billionaires are not old money - they are new money people who grew up middle class and know what it is like to struggle. They are people who innovated or created something new to get rich. We find it no surprise therefore that [PERSON] has the most active billionaires of anywhere - anywhere in the world - where the super wealthy try to change the [STREET] society works. Yes, there are heartless billionaires who want nothing more than horde what they have - but the overwhelming majority of billionaires in [PERSON] made their money after living like one of the people and from thinking of a bold big new [STREET] to change things. Our plan is to reach out to these billionaires and these politicians who dream big and got to their wealth and power because they made big bold decisions that were different and shocking. In [PERSON] - most of the people in power and in super wealth got that [STREET] from dreaming and acting in a dramatically different [STREET]. When we tell them - that the people want [ORGANIZATION] to be a nation - and that you could be a leader in a nation - not just a state - it will appeal to their sense of making a big bold change, and being famous. That will be enough - to get enough of the wealthy and powerful to support [PERSON] against those billionaires and powerful politicians who will not want change. Yes many will stand against this - but they will not stand against an equally powerful, connected, resourced person - they will agree to not fight each other and let the game play out. Thats all we can ask for. Those wealthy and powerful who want to become even more famous because they support something - that they can see a plan the people of [PERSON] definitely want - aka a true grassroots desire - will stand for and protect this movement. Ill address your point of the world needing less capitalism, not more. I get what you are saying - I grew up in a Mexican [PERSON]tholic household- although I am not religious now, my family vol[ORGANIZATION]teered in the comm[ORGANIZATION]ity, protested, and told off teachers who taught the wrong thing, and we were brought up being told that charity and helping other people is the best thing that you can do. We learned that there is a sacred honor to help the poor and less fort[ORGANIZATION]ate. I spent [DATE] of my life talking about why things were morally right and why things should be done a certain [STREET] because it is the right thing to do. I fo[ORGANIZATION]d that when I focused on just the moral reason - that I was blocked by half of the population - namely, the mainstream media, all elected officials at every level and anyone who is middle class. This is a huge amo[ORGANIZATION]t of people to just have turned off to your plan on how to make life better for the other half. I fo[ORGANIZATION]d that when I explained why it was in their interest to do what is right - that they started to listen and started to actually change the [STREET] that they did things so that you got results - you actually started making things better. A perfect example is a grass roots project I work at in my home town. We want to build a system of bicycle lanes on canals - so that people dont have to [STREET] everywhere. This will allow people who cant afford a car to be able to have the same mobility as the middle class and rich because it is much cheaper to own a bike. GPE45 has incredible poverty - yet the entire [LOCATION] region is set up so that you cant do anything if you dont have a car. GPE45 also doesnt spend enough on transit. So providing a [STREET] for bicycles to compete with cars as a [STREET] of getting anywhere in GPE45 is a [STREET] that would allow most - the overwhelming majority - but not all of the poor - a [STREET] to live life to a dramatically increased quality. I was able to get GPE45 to start spending money on making this bike freeway system, as we call it - because I could show them that it was in their economic interest to help the poor. The rich are not going to help the poor for the sake of doing so. When I showed them that, economically it was in the benefit of the rich to provide for the poor - then all of the sudden, after [ORGANIZATION]2 of having the highest death rate for bicyclists anywhere in the Republic of [PERSON], GPE45 started moving to create a bike network that will help the poor. They had [ORGANIZATION]2 prior of knowing they had the highest death rate of bicyclists and that most bicyclists dying were all poor, and they did nothing. People dying were not a strong enough case to get the system to change. When we argued it was in their interest to do this - change happened. Not talk - real change - that will have a real impact on literally h[ORGANIZATION]dreds of thousands of poor people. I [ORGANIZATION]derstand my situation, that when you talk about capitalism and economics, you so[ORGANIZATION]d like a heartless Republican - because that is who normally talks about this. But economics is the [STREET] the entire world works. Even in socialism and comm[ORGANIZATION]ists and tribal societies - economics is what powers everything. So when you can explain how helping the poor - helps the rich - suddenly the rich who are in control of everything - actually let that change happen. Yes [ORGANIZATION] focuses on these economic arguments not to be heartless, not because we dont care about the poor - because we have seen this is the fastest [STREET] to dramatically improve the lives of many poor people.

[ORGANIZATION] is also considering an indoor mask requirement3 and a vaccine mandate that could extend beyond city employees  which would go further than Gov. [PERSON] recent announcement4 that health care workers and state employees must be vaccinated or undergo [ORGANIZATION] testing. President [PERSON] on [ORGANIZATION] adopted a similar policy5 for federal workers  of which [PERSON] has the most outside of [ORGANIZATION]. Also [ORGANIZATION], a federal judge implied [ORGANIZATION] policy didnt go far enough and said he would consider ordering all [PERSON] prison employees and inmate firefighters7 to be vaccinated. GPE4 said it will require all students and employees8 who return to campus in [DATE] to undergo [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] testing regardless of vaccination status  a rule that previously applied only to the unvaccinated. [ORGANIZATION] Mayor PERSON3 said the [ORGANIZATION] variant could possibly derail the citys return to in-person learning9. Major [PERSON]-based companies, including [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and ORG2, postponed office reopenings. And a whopping 36 of 58 counties12 [ORGANIZATION]7 have coronavirus case rates that would have catapulted them into the most restrictive purple tier of [PERSON]s [ORGANIZATION]7-extinct reopening blueprint  up from 12 DATE5. PERSON4 told ORG3 that mixed messaging is likely complicating the states efforts to improve vaccination rates, especially in underserved communities. [ORGANIZATION] that just 45 of eligible [PERSON]ns enrolled in [LOCATION], the states health care program for the poor, had received at least one vaccine dose as of [ORGANIZATION]  compared to 70 of all eligible [PERSON]ns. Still, [PERSON]s first-dose vaccinations for [ORGANIZATION] increased 21 compared to [ORGANIZATION], according to [ORGANIZATION]  a sign that residents are heeding health officials warnings about the [ORGANIZATION] variant. In any case, the state plans to reassume control of vaccine distribution. ORG6, the health insurance giant [PERSON] tapped DATE9 to streamline a confusing patchwork of vaccination efforts, will soon transition to an advisory role, with its contracts scheduled to end in [LOCATION]0, according to slides18 from an internal [LOCATION]1 meeting between ORG7 and vaccine providers first obtained by [PERSON]. Also [ORGANIZATION], ORG6  a major [ORGANIZATION] donor20  gave 1 million to the [PERSON] Democratic Party21. The [ORGANIZATION] administration awarded ORG6 the no-bid contract of up to 15 million22 to lead [PERSON]s vaccine distribution in [LOCATION]2.

Unemployment going in wrong direction [PERSON] is facing an unemployment paradox. Image via [PERSON]1 Another sign that things in [PERSON] arent going back to normal New unemployment claims jumped to their highest level30 since the states [LOCATION]7 reopening, with more than 67,400 residents submitting claims for [LOCATION]8, according to federal data released [ORGANIZATION]31. Not only is that an increase of nearly 11,000 from [ORGANIZATION]0, but it also accounts for nearly 20 of all claims filed nationwide  even though [PERSON] represents less than 12 of the countrys civilian labor force. Paradoxically, the uptick in jobless claims comes amid an outpouring of jobs, with many businesses struggling to hire workers32. Job postings in [PERSON] were more than 5 above pre-pandemic levels for [ORGANIZATION]1, according to [ORGANIZATION], a former [PERSON]2 director and attorney at PERSON8. PERSON9 The conventional wisdom has been that hiring in [PERSON] would come in [ORGANIZATION]2 when the federal unemployment supplement of 300 ended, the schools reopened and child care became more available. The [ORGANIZATION]3 numbers suggest that [ORGANIZATION]2 may not bring that major reduction in unemployment claims or increase in hiring. 2. Recall campaign intensifies Supporters of gubernatorial recall candidate PERSON10 rally in GPE6 on [ORGANIZATION]4. PERSON11 for [ORGANIZATION] The closer the [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] recall election33 gets, the more political lines are being drawn in the sand. On [ORGANIZATION], the [PERSON]6 of [PERSON]  part of a national organization that defends groups and causes ranging from [PERSON]4 to transgender [DATE]  took the unprecedented step of issuing a statement opposing the recall. PERSON12, executive director of [PERSON]5 and GPE7 counties In [ORGANIZATION]6 in [PERSON], the [PERSON]6 has never endorsed or opposed a candidate during an election and isnotdoing so [ORGANIZATION]7. The [PERSON]6 opposes this recall effort because it aims to reverse advances inimmigrants rights, gender equity, racial justice, LGBTQ rights,criminal justice reform and students rights. With so much at stake, we will not be silent. The statement came [ORGANIZATION]8 former [PERSON]7 GPE8 Gov. [PERSON] traveled to [ORGANIZATION]9 to drum up support for the recall. PERSON14, a top donor to the recall effort36, accused [ORGANIZATION] of showcasing both hypocrisy and [PERSON]two things that really dont belong in public officials. Interestingly, he also noted, Its hard to recall a public official  and quite frankly, it oughta be hard. It oughta be a tough threshold to meet. [PERSON]ns would seem to agree. A [LOCATION]1 poll from [PERSON]8 of [PERSON]37 found that 60 of likely voters support limiting the reasons for which politicians can be recalled, while 55 support doubling the number of signatures required to force a recall election. A whopping 68 support holding a top-two runoff election if the recall succeeds and no replacement candidate receives more than 50 of the vote under current rules38, challengers can win with far less. 3. Will students get more voting power? [PERSON]9 Trustees PERSON15 and PERSON16 at [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION]0. Photo courtesy of [PERSON] State Student Association The boards governing [PERSON]s three public higher education systems would each have two voting student members if state lawmakers pass a bill currently pending in the ORG22. The move would effectively double the number of student voices in some of the nations largest higher education systems [PERSON] Community Colleges, [PERSON] State University and the University of [PERSON]  and send a strong message about the competence of student representatives, PERSON17 reports for [ORGANIZATION] College Journalism Network39. The bill would also expand the voting powers of student members on the ORG28 ORG27, meaning theyd have more say on hot-button issues like student housing, enrollment expansions40 and tuition hikes. But even with limited voting capacity, theyve already made a difference ORG28 regents [ORGANIZATION]1 modified their plan toraise tuition [ORGANIZATION]2 without any sunset date41, instead adopting an amendment by a student member to keep the tuition hike on the books for [ORGANIZATION]3 and vote on the issue again in [ORGANIZATION]4.

san francisco,2021-10-20T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,San Francisco Chronicle,housing crisis,PERSON0: Please save water,"That was the message Gov. [PERSON] sent [ORGANIZATION] when he declared a drought [PERSON] for the entire state of [ORGANIZATION]  a move that adds urgency to his plea asking residents to slash water use by 152, but stops short of mandatory restrictions3. It also falls short of the tougher measures some experts say are necessary to curb the states devastating [LOCATION]. Although 50 of [ORGANIZATION]s 58 counties have been under drought emergencies since DATE1  DATE2 [PERSON] asked for 15 reduction in water use  residents have so far been slow to respond. According to data released [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]ns in [ORGANIZATION] cut their home water use by 5 compared to [PERSON]  an improvement from the 1.8 reduction they posted in [PERSON], but still far from desired levels, [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] has faced pressure for [ORGANIZATION] to chart a stricter drought response. In [LOCATION], a bipartisan group of state [PERSON] asked him to declare a statewide drought emergency [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] issued an emergency proclamation, but only for two counties9.

Among [ORGANIZATION] Auditor PERSON4 key findings The state hasnt ensured that school districts submit required DATE20 spending reports  and when it does receive them, it doesnt verify that money is being spent appropriately. For example, although most of the federal funds are reserved for specific purposes, districts as of DATE21 had used a whopping 40 of one pool of money for other activities  which could translate to unallowable purposes, PERSON5 wrote. The state also isnt tracking which districts risk losing federal funds ahead of the DATE22 spending deadline. Further hampering its ability to effectively leverage data, the state monitored the spending of less than 1 of school districts last fiscal [PERSON]. Stronger oversight is needed, PERSON5 wrote, because the [PERSON] is responsible for ensuring that districts fully leverage federal funds to address the needs of their most vulnerable students, close the learning loss gaps that emerged because of the pandemic, and return students safely to school. The [PERSON] agreed to implement many of [LOCATION] recommendations22, but said stricter oversight of other activities spending wasnt necessary Since the Other Activities category includes salaries, a significant expense for districts, [ORGANIZATION] was not surprised with the amount of expenditures reported in this category. 2.

The [ORGANIZATION] Department of Public Health  which also sent nearly 6,000 of the companys medical workers to county health departments, mass vaccination sites and [ORGANIZATION] serving farmworkers and undocumented immigrants  said it wasnt aware of the companys history of building border walls in the state. And many of the organizations assisted by [ORGANIZATION]1 didnt realize where the employees came from. Its the latest contract to set off alarm bells Last [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] PERSON8 and [ORGANIZATION] found that [ORGANIZATION] entered into roughly 3 billion worth of no-bid contracts24 for pandemic supplies  some of which went to untested vendors, including a company that had been in business for [DATE].

Its known as the three-strikes malpractice law and requires that doctors with three findings of malpractice lose their license. Sounds pretty simple, right? But then the [ORGANIZATION] Legislature in [ORGANIZATION]1 got invol[ORGANIZATION]5d and made it nearly impossible for ORG30 to levy a strike. The law says a strike happens after a judgment of malpractice by the [STREET] in a lawsuit or a finding by ORG30 or an arbitrator.

[ORGANIZATION]s [ORGANIZATION] surge22 via PERSON71 of ORG57  The most common explanation for the outbreaks in the [ORGANIZATION] that we saw o[ORGANIZATION]5r the recent [ORGANIZATION]7 was the low vaccination rates across the region.

The data show very clearly that where you had [ORGANIZATION] protests, killing of people by the police decreased. Its inescapable from this study that protest mattersthat it can generate change. However, this change is still from a bad baseline. And the question of what sort of reforms might work is still a very much debated question. You might also be interested in an earlier piece on this topic DATE0 Without Cops Could GPE0 Policing Experiment be a Model for the Future?2 From our overview THE CITY has mentioned trained violence interruptors before in its articles here, they appear as a key element in a police reform experiment.

Although [LOCATION] in one district is too limited a trial to declare victory, this test went well and strongly suggests that this approach merits more implementations and refinements. As youll see from the article, some of the elements for success were situation-specific. The [ORGANIZATION] area had a tense relationship with the police. [ORGANIZATION] moved one cop whod roughed up some locals off the [STREET] and also replaced the precinct head with a an officer from the neighborhood. That commanding officer, [ORGANIZATION], set out to rebuild relations with the community. By [PERSON], Assistant Professor of [ORGANIZATION] and Criminology, ORG2 and PERSON2, Clinical Instructor of [ORGANIZATION] and Criminology, ORG2. Originally published at ORG3 The guilty verdicts delivered against [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION] represented a landmark moment - but courtroom justice cannot deliver the sweeping changes most [PERSON]ns feel are needed5 to improve policing in the [ORGANIZATION] As [PERSON] continues to grapple with racism and police killings, federal action over police reform has stalled6 in [LOCATION]. But at the state level there is [PERSON] and steps toward reform are underway in many [ORGANIZATION] cities, including Philadelphia8 [PERSON], [PERSON] and GPE6, Oregon10. Many of these efforts11 are geared toward ending specific practices, such as the granting of qualified immunity12, through which officers are shielded from civil lawsuits, and the use of certain police neck holds13 and no-knock warrants14. Mayors and city councils nationwide have also pushed reforms emphasizing accountability and transparency15, with many working to create independent oversight commissions16. Its too soon to expect substantial improvement from these recently proposed remedies. But as scholars of criminal justice17 - one a former police officer of [ORGANIZATION] - we know [PERSON] has been here before. From [ORGANIZATION] to [LOCATION] and [PERSON] to GPE9, numerous city police departments have undergone transformation efforts following controversial police killings. But these and other reform movements havent lived up to their promises. Resisting Change After the shooting death in [ORGANIZATION]0 of unarmed teen PERSON4 in [DATE], police in [ORGANIZATION] agreed to a reform program20that included anti-bias training and an agreement to end stop, search and arrest practices that discriminate on the basis of race. But [PERSON] into the process, a report by the nonprofit Forward Through [ORGANIZATION]21 found the reforms had done little to change policing culture or practice22. This was backed up by a [ORGANIZATION] Civilian Review Board report in [ORGANIZATION] that found the disparity in traffic stops between black and white residents appears to be growing. Similarly, concerns over the quality of [LOCATION]s police services persist24 despite federal oversight and reforms brought in after the death of PERSON5 in police custody in [LOCATION]. Commentators have pointed to a resistance to change26 among officers and an inability to garner community buy-in27 as reasons for the slowdown in progress in [LOCATION]. Part of the problem, as seen with [LOCATION], is that federal intervention does not appear to guarantee lasting change28. Research shows29 that ORG7 regulations aimed at reform only slightly reduce police misconduct. There is also no evidence that national efforts targeting the use of force alone mitigate police [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] beacon of hope is ORG8. DATE8, residents in [ORGANIZATION]1 experienced events similar to what many cities have faced in more recent DATE9. An unarmed Black man, [PERSON], was shot dead by officers in [LOCATION]0, sparking widespread unrest. It led [ORGANIZATION]1 to enter into a different model of reform a collaborative agreement32. Touted by former [ORGANIZATION] Attorney General [PERSON] as a national model for community-led police reform33, the collaborative agreement saw the [INSTITUTION], civic government, police unions and local civil rights groups act in partnership for a reform program backed by [STREET] supervision. The resulting changes to use-of-force policies, a focus on community-based solutions to crime, and robust oversight brought about improved policing. A [LOCATION]1 ORG9 evaluation34 of the collaborative agreement found it resulted in a reduction in crime, positive changes in citizens attitudes toward police and fewer racially biased traffic stops. There were also fewer use-of-force incidents and officer and arrestee injuries35 under the collaborative agreement. But it isnt perfect. [ORGANIZATION]1s Black residents continue to be disproportionately arrested - likely owing to the concentration of crime, service calls and police deployments in predominantly Black neighborhoods. Figures from [LOCATION]2 show Black [ORGANIZATION]1 residents were roughly three times36 as likely to be arrested as their white counterparts. [ORGANIZATION]1s collaborative agreement contained a number of elements that experts say are needed if police reforms are to be successful strong leadership, flexible, goal-oriented approaches, effective oversight and externally regulated transparency. Moreover, it depended on police officials ability to cultivate community investment37 and overcome resistance from police officers and police unions. Community confidence is critical to police reform and community safety38. When citizens view police as legitimate and trustworthy, they are more likely to report crimes, cooperate during police investigations, comply with directives and work with police to find solutions to crime. [ORGANIZATION] like that in [ORGANIZATION]1 that put community engagement at the heart of police reforms undoubtedly are strides in the right direction. But they can go only so far. A noticeable shortcoming in most police reform programs is a focus on what is the right thing to do during confrontations with the public, rather than on trying to avert those situations in the first [STREET]. Fatal police shootings39 often happen during police stops and arrests - situations that carry increased risks40 of citizen resistance and violent police response. Scaling back low-level enforcement, such as arrests for vagrancy and loitering - much of which has little public safety advantage41- and having police partner with civilian responders for mental health, homelessness and drug-related calls, could mean fewer opportunities for violent police encounters42. Some departments have begun to change their enforcement policies along these lines. [ORGANIZATION]1 in [ORGANIZATION]2, for example, stopped making arrests and issuing citations for [PERSON] possession43. A [LOCATION]2 study44 of traffic stops in [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]4, found that redirecting enforcement away from minor infractions - such as broken taillights and expired tags - toward the more serious violations of speeding and running traffic lights resulted in reduced crime and a narrowed racial gap in stops and searches. Removing the [PERSON] Low-level infractions have often been the triggers for police interventions that end in citizen [LOCATION]. PERSON8 - who died in [DATE] after a [ORGANIZATION]5 police officer put him in a banned [LOCATION] - was stopped for selling loose cigarettes47. Devoting less time to policing such activity would also free up officers time to devote to such endeavors as analyzing crime trends, conducting wellness checks on elderly residents and mentoring community youth. PERSON9 felt this as a police officer on the [STREET], and I see it as a criminal justice scholar now. The examples of [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] show that getting community buy-in is crucial if attempts to improve policing are to be successful. We believe that evaluating officers performance and rewarding them based on community-oriented activities - rather than just the number of stops and arrests - could foster the support necessary for lasting reform.38utm_mediumfeedamp38utm_campaignFeedNakedCapitalism28nakedcapitalism29 This entry was posted in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] Post49, Income disparity50, [ORGANIZATION] on [LOCATION]3 by [PERSON]0.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36 stateOhioamp38agency[ORGANIZATION]120Police20Departmentamp38categoryall_arrests_totalamp38subcategorytotamp38subsubcategoryRaceamp38ratetrueamp38percentfalseamp38monthlyfalseamp38checkbox_1falseamp38checkbox_2falseamp38checkbox_3falseamp38checkbox_4falseamp38checkbox_1true  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54"

portland,2019-04-19T00:00:00Z,Naked Capitalism,The Oregonian,affordable housing,Making [ORGANIZATION],"[ORGANIZATION], a visual arts teacher in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Originally published at [ORGANIZATION], I sat in a cramped conference room in the large public high school where I teach in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. I was listening to the principal deliver a scripted PowerPoint presentation on the 35-million-dollar budget deficit our district faces in [LOCATION]. Teachers and staff members slumped in chairs. A thick funk of disappointment, resignation, hopelessness, and simmering anger clung to us. After all, weve been here before. We know the drill expect layoffs, ballooning class sizes, diminished instructional time, and not enough resources. Accept that the teacher-student relationship  one that has the potential to be productive and sometimes even transformative  will become, at best, transactional. Bodies will be crammed into too-small spaces, resources will dwindle, and learning will suffer. These budgetary crises are by now cyclical and completely familiar. Yet the thought of weathering another of them is devastating. This is the third time in my DATE2-career as a visual arts teacher that weve faced the upheaval, disruption, and chaos of just such a budget crisis. In [LOCATION], the district experienced a massive shortfall that resulted in the firing of 344 teachers and bloated class sizes for those of us who were left. At one point, my Drawing I classroom studio  built to fit a maximum of 35 students  had more than 50 of them stuffed into it. We didnt have enough chairs, tables, or spaces to draw, so we worked in the halls. During DATE4 I taught six separate classes and was responsible for more than 250 students. Despite the pretense that real instruction was taking [STREET], teachers like me were largely engaged in crowd management and little more. All of the meaningful parts of the job  connecting with students, providing one-on-one support, helping struggling class members to make social and intellectual breakthroughs, not to speak of creating a healthy classroom community  simply fell by the wayside. I couldnt remember my students names, was unable to keep up with the usual grading and assessments were supposed to do, and was overwhelmed by stress and anxiety. Worst of all, I was unable to provide the emotional support I normally try to give my students. I couldnt listen because there wasnt time. On the [STREET] to work, I was paralyzed by dread on the [STREET] home, cowed by feelings of failure. The experience of [PERSON] was demoralizing and humiliating. My love for my students, my passion for the subjects I teach, and ultimately my professional identity were all stripped from me. And what was lost for the students? Quality instruction and adult mentorship, as well as access to vital resources  not to mention a loss of faith in one of [ORGANIZATION] supposedly bedrock institutions, the [INSTITUTION]. And keep in mind that whats happening in my school and in [PERSON]s schools more generally is anything but unique. According to ORG2, divestment2 in education is occurring in every single state in the nation, with 25 states spending less on education than they did before the recession of [ORGANIZATION]. The refusal of individual states to prioritize spending on education coupled with the [ORGANIZATION] administrations proposed3 7 billion in cuts to ORG3 are already beginning to make the situation in our nations public schools untenable  for both students and teachers. Sitting in that conference room, listening to my capable and dedicated boss describe our potential return to a distorted reality I remembered well made me recoil. Bracing myself for the soul-crushing grind of trying to convince students to buy into a system that will almost by definition fail to address, no less meet, their needs  to get them to show up [ORGANIZATION] even though there arent enough seats, supplies, or teachers to do the job  is an exercise in futility. The truth of the matter is that a society that refuses to adequately invest in the education of its children is refusing to invest in the future. Think of it as nihilism on a grand scale. Teachers as First Responders Schools are loud, vital, chaotic places, unlike any other public space in [ORGANIZATION]. Comprehensive public high schools reflect the socioeconomic, racial, religious, and cultural makeup of the population they serve. Each school has its own particular culture and ecosystem of rules, structures, core beliefs, and values. Each also has its own set of problems, specific to the population that walks through its doors [ORGANIZATION]. Coping with the complexity and magnitude of those problems makes the job of creating a thriving, equitable4, and productive space for learning something akin to magical thinking. The reflexive blame now regularly heaped on schools, teachers, and students in this country is a misrepresentation of reality. The real reason we are being left [PERSON] our global peers when it comes to student achievement has to do with so much more than the failure to perform well on standardized tests. Our kids are struggling not because weve forgotten how to teach them or theyve forgotten how to learn, but because the adults who run this society have largely decided that their collective future is not a priority. In reality, the tattered and rapidly deteriorating6 infrastructure of our national system of social services leaves schools and teachers as front-line first responders in what Id call a national crisis of the soul. So its no surprise to me that teachers, even in the reddest of states, have been walking out7 of their classrooms and demanding change. Such walkouts in [LOCATION], [PERSON], [PERSON], GPE6, GPE7, GPE8, GPE9, and [PERSON]0 have reflected grievances more all-encompassing than the pleas for higher pay that have made the headlines. And in so many states, they are still being paid less8 than a living wage. Demands for just compensation are symbolic and easy for the public to grasp. The higher pay won through some of those walkouts represents an acknowledgement that teachers are being asked to do a seemingly impossible job in a society whose priorities are increasingly out of whack, amid the crumbling infrastructure of the public-school system itself. idea that the real world is somehow separate from the world inside our schools and that issues of inequality, poverty, mental health, addiction, and racism wont impact the capacity of our students to [ORGANIZATION] academically sets a dangerous precedent for measuring success. Assuming that the student living in a car, not a home, should be able to stay awake during a lecture, that the one returning from [ORGANIZATION] in a psychiatric ward should be able to instantly tackle a difficult math test, and that the one whose undocumented father was just picked up by [ORGANIZATION] officers should have no problem concentrating as her teacher diagrams sentences in English is a grand delusion. In fact, among the many demands of teachers and their unions during the strikes of DATE9 were calls10 for more financial support for comprehensive social services for students. In [PERSON]1, teachers fought for legal support11 for students in danger of deportation. In GPE7, teachers are planning a new round of strikes that will, among other things, demand ORG5 coverage expansion12 aimed at improving student health. In [PERSON]2, teachers included a call for affordable housing13 in their negotiations and so drew attention to the importance of supporting students both in and out of the classroom. If schools are expected to pick up the slack for the gaping holes in our social safety net, it follows that they should be designed and funded with that purpose in mind. If teachers are supposed not only to teach but to act as counselors, therapists, and social workers, they should be paid salaries that reflect such weighty demands and should have access to resources that support such work. Why Prioritizing School Funding Matters There is a large disconnect14 between the lip service paid to supporting public schools and teachers and a visible reticence to adequately fund them. Ask almost anyone  save Secretary of [ORGANIZATION]  if they support teachers and schools and the answer is probably yes. Bring up the question of how to actually provide adequate financial support for education, however, and youll quickly find yourself mired in arguments about wasteful school spending, pension funds that drain resources, sub-par teachers, and bureaucratic bloat, as well as claims that you cant just continue to throw money at a problem, that money is not the solution. Id argue that money certainly is part of the solution. In a capitalist society, money represents value and power. In [ORGANIZATION], when you put money into something, you give it meaning. Students are more than capable of grasping that when school funding is being cut, its because we as a society have decided that investing in public education doesnt carry enough value or meaning. The prioritization16 of spending on the military, as well as the emphasis of the [ORGANIZATION] administration and congressional Republicans on a staggering tax cut17 for the rich, corporate tax evasion18, and the dismantling of whats left of the social safety net couldnt send a louder message about how much of a priority the wellbeing of the majority of this nations kids actually is. The [LOCATION]0 federal budget invested19 716 billion in national security, 686 billion of which has been earmarked for ORG7 with even more [PERSON] figures expected [LOCATION]1. Compare that to the 59.9 billion in discretionary appropriations for [ORGANIZATION] and the expected future cuts to its budget. Point made, no? However, since federal school contributions add up to only a small percentage of local and state education budgets, all blame cant go there. In [PERSON], for instance, [ORGANIZATION] placed on property taxes in [LOCATION]2 artificially limited such revenue, forcing the state to start relying heavily on income taxes to keep schools afloat. Corporations are an important source of income for states. Yet, though corporate profits in the [PERSON]3 rose by 69.3 billion to an all-time [PERSON] of more than two trillion dollars in [LOCATION]3, over [LOCATION]4 the states share of income-tax revenue has fallen to half what it was in [LOCATION]5. Take ORG9, whose worldwide headquarters are located only a few miles from the high school where I teach. It stands as a shining example23 of a corporation that has profited handsomely from sheltering income abroad24 while evading local tax responsibilities. ORG9 has a special relationship with the state of [PERSON], which taxes only the companys local profits, not those earned elsewhere. Adding insult to injury, according to The [PERSON]ian, by [LOCATION]6, ORG9 had put 12.2 billion of its earnings into offshore tax shelters25. Had that money been repatriated, the company could have owed up to 4.1 billion in [PERSON]3 taxes, which means it has a modest hand in the monetary shortfalls that leave schools like mine in desperate straits. In reality, [PERSON]s economy is thriving26 and yet how little it all matters, since here we are again on the precipice of another crisis. In [LOCATION]7, the state government formed a committee made up of educators, legislators, business leaders, and parents to create a reliable budgetary tool that would correlate school funding needs with student performance. This Quality ORG6 Model set out a standard for what a quality education would look like for every student in [PERSON]. In [LOCATION]8 since then, the state legislature has reliably failed to meet the funding goals set out by that model. [LOCATION]9, it calls for 10.7 billion in education spending, while the state legislatures joint ways and means committee recently released a budget27 that included spending of just 8.87 billion on the school system. Such DATE20 shortages of funds have, over time, helped create the present gaping hole in our public education system. And DATE21 that hole grows larger. [PERSON] in Our Nations Institutions Public schools represent one of the bedrock institutions of [ORGANIZATION]n democracy. Yet as a society weve stood aside as the very institutions that actually made [ORGANIZATION] great were gutted and undermined by short-term thinking, corporate greed, and unconscionable disrespect for our collective future. The truth is that there is money for education, for schools, for teachers, and for students. We just dont choose to prioritize education spending and so send a loud-and-clear message to students that education doesnt truly matter. And when you essentially defund education for DATE22, you leave kids with ever less faith28 in [ORGANIZATION]n institutions, which is a genuine tragedy. On DATE23, educators across the state of [PERSON] are planning to walk out of schools. The action, a precursor to a strike, is a direct response to the inadequate funding in the upcoming state budget and a referendum on the continuing divestment in public education. Teachers like me will be stepping out of our classrooms not because we dont want to teach, but because we do.

Even a sovereign state, [ORGANIZATION], received a 1.5 million loan under the federal ORG2. Nonprofits with religious affiliations received the most number of loans, 406. Thats more than one-third of the 1,080 loans extended to nonprofits. But in terms of loan dollars distributed, no one received more than nonprofit health care providers, including medical practices 33.3 million, hospitals 30 million and nursing homes 19.1 million. By contrast, schools, churches and social services with a religious affiliation received 20.3 million. Who got what Search our database of [PERSON] recipientsNonprofit leaders, much like business operators, told [PERSON] the federal aid was critical. [ORGANIZATION], CEO at [LOCATION], told [PERSON] that he at first feared the organization, which offers health care services to underserved people, was too large to qualify as a small business. [PERSON] said he was glad to make the cut the loan saved the operation. This was a lifeline for us, he said. The loan helped the regions largest arts and education center, as well. [ORGANIZATION] and live performances, its lifeblood, were canceled due to the pandemic.PERSON2, the institutions president, said [LOCATION] revenue cratered without the expected 100,000 visitors. But its not just the institution that was affected, he said. These were body blows to our region, he said. Coming up DATE2 Overview of 2.4 billion program9. DATE3 Companies receiving the most aid10. [PERSON] nonprofits that received funding. DATE5 The have-nots, and how to improve on a successor program.[ORGANIZATION] said the inclusion of nonprofits in the aid program was important, in part because they assist some of the communitys most vulnerable people. However, he said the [PERSON] analysis suggests the program fell short regarding nonprofits. We couldve done better and we shouldve done better, he said.Health care providers obtained most [ORGANIZATION], 523 billion in loans were disbursed through the ORG211. Funds went primarily to companies and nonprofits with up to 500 employees. Sixty percent of each loan was earmarked to cover [ORGANIZATION] payroll the balance could pay for other operating expenses, including rent. The loans ranging from up to 10 million to under 1,000 are forgivable, if spent according to the rules. Altogether, 1,081 [ORGANIZATION] nonprofits received 272.5 million. That accounts for 12 percent of the 2.4 billion the eight counties of [ORGANIZATION] received in [ORGANIZATION] loans. Doctors and their medical practices as a group obtained more [ORGANIZATION] loans than any industrial sector, 117.2 million, including both for-profit and nonprofit operations. Nineteen nonprofits accounted for 33.3 million of that figure. Among the nonprofit recipients was the oncology unit at ORG7, which obtained a 1.6 million loan. [ORGANIZATION] led the list of nonprofit hospitals that obtained loans. In addition to borrowing 10 million, the hospital also obtained 51.6 million in federal relief funds under the CARES Act. That money was not included in our analysis. Six other nonprofit hospitals in the region also obtained loans, including ORG9 in [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]0 in GPE4 and [ORGANIZATION]1 in [PERSON]. Double Your Donation Donations of up to 1,000 made by [ORGANIZATION] will be matched.

Private colleges, which collectively received 5.8 million, included [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION]7 and [ORGANIZATION]8 Largest nonprofit recipients by sector [ORGANIZATION]9. PERSON4, a senior fellow at [ORGANIZATION], an GPE7-based research think tank, said the distribution of loans reflect the regions economic dependence on education and health care21. The regions medical sector alone employs 93,000, according to DATE8 federal data. Its enormous, which is what ultimately accounts for the big money there in the nonprofit sector, he said.Lending to religious organizationsThe loans to 406 religious organizations far outnumbered those given to other types of nonprofits. The sector receiving the second most loans, [DATE], involves civic and social organizations, such as ORG21, ORG22 and ORG23. Altogether, faith-based organizations received 20.3 million. [PERSON], a [ORGANIZATION]-based megachurch, received the largest loan, 900,000. ORG25 received 335,512 after filing for bankruptcy due to civil lawsuits filed by survivors of sexual abuse at the hands of priests.

[PERSON]9, which manages the [LOCATION]1 Erie County Fair, received 600,000. [PERSON], the organizations chief financial officer, said the money was initially used to plan the fair [LOCATION]2. Nearly all of it was earmarked for payroll and benefits. Public health and financial risks led to the cancelation of the fair34, the organizations single-largest revenue generator at 7 million. It was a gut-wrenching decision, [ORGANIZATION] said. The cancelation triggered furloughs for 30 of the 45 staff members. Seven have returned to work since. Those still on lay-off had their health insurance coverage extended through the end of [LOCATION]3. Like the fair, [LOCATION]0 is a major economic engine for the surrounding area.

buffalo,2018-07-05T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Buffalo News,homeless,[ORGANIZATION] not enforcing its fair housing law,"Most people would have let it go. But [ORGANIZATION] knew that refusing to rent to somebody because they receive Section 8 is a violation of [ORGANIZATION]s fair housing law. She filed a complaint with [ORGANIZATION], a local fair housing organization. [ORGANIZATION] undercover testing showed that what happened to her wasnt a one-off, and passed these findings on to the citys fair housing officer. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] is still waiting to hear back. [ORGANIZATION]s fair housing law6 was put in [STREET] to protect the thousands of city residents who rely on government assistance to pay their rent. But, in [LOCATION] since the law passed, the city has done little to enforce it, despite receiving at least 25 complaints like the one [ORGANIZATION] filed, most of them borne out by undercover testing - the gold standard in housing discrimination cases. In many cases, its unclear whether city officials even decided whether a landlord had violated the law. Those decisions, when they were made, were painfully slow. And even when a landlord was found to have discriminated, in most cases theres no indication that the city took any action against them. In [ORGANIZATION], one of the nations poorest cities, Section 8 is a lifeline for thousands of families. But an entire swath of the rental market is off limits to Section 8 tenants - not because they cant afford the rent, but because many landlords refuse to take their vouchers. The enforcement of this ordinance has been wholly insufficient and is a slap in the face to hardworking, lower-income families, said PERSON1, [ORGANIZATION] executive director. This demonstrates that fair housing is not a priority of this local government. [PERSON] said the city is very aggressive in pursuing fair housing cases, and that any cases that have not been resolved are pending. In fact, records show that city officials allowed many cases to sit, unresolved, for [ORGANIZATION] - then argued they couldnt do anything because the statute of limitations had expired. ORG2 was able to find only one case where the city took legal action against a landlord - and then only recently, after we began asking about the lack of enforcement. In most cases, city officials havent pursued out-of-[STREET] remedies, like bringing the parties together to work out a settlement, or making landlords take fair housing training, either. Case files have been lost. The position of fair housing officer has sat vacant for [ORGANIZATION] at a time. A [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] study7 concluded that the law has been a failure on substantive grounds due to the lack of implementation. The citys inaction gives landlords who discriminate little incentive to obey the law. In one case, a landlord had a message on their answering machine No smoking and no Section 8. In another, a landlord emailed one of [ORGANIZATION] testers, My ad on [LOCATION] states on the first line that I do not accept section 8 Good luck with your house hunt! Theres no record of the city taking action against either one. This story is based on a review of discrimination complaints referred to the city by [ORGANIZATION], emails and memos between city officials and fair housing advocates, and interviews with more than 30 people, including those who filed complaints and landlords who had complaints filed against them. PERSON3, whose wife owns the apartment [ORGANIZATION] looked at, said they dont discriminate against anyone. He wasnt sure if the case had been resolved, but said he hasnt heard anything from the city in [DATE]. Gloria [ORGANIZATION] filed a discrimination complaint with the city in DATE5. It still hasnt been resolved. Photo by PERSON5 For Gloria [ORGANIZATION], it wasnt just about this particular apartment, or this particular landlord. For her, Section 8 is a godsend. She remembers the relief she felt when she first received her voucher, after [ORGANIZATION] on the waiting list. She was taken aback at how many landlords wouldnt accept it. For somebody to just decide, well, Im not going to deal with you because you have that program thats assisting you, its ridiculous, she said.[PERSON] in the makingIt took [ORGANIZATION] almost four [ORGANIZATION] to pass a fair housing law. In DATE8, fair housing legislation twice won support on [ORGANIZATION], only to be vetoed, both times, by [PERSON]. At one tense public hearing, in DATE9, angry homeowners kept interrupting the bills authors as they tried to explain it. By this point, fair housing had become the third rail of [ORGANIZATION] politics and no one wanted to touch it, said [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] executive director for 35 [ORGANIZATION], until his retirement at the end of DATE5. It was 17 [ORGANIZATION] before [ORGANIZATION] would revisit the issue, [LOCATION]3 into [DATE] term as mayor. Even in [LOCATION]4, when the law finally passed, it was only by one vote. ORG7 Member [PERSON] denounced the proposed legislation as social engineering, telling The [ORGANIZATION] News he feared this kind of law would deny property owners the right to choose their tenants. I dont want to be forced to rent to scumbags who might live down the [STREET], he said.Stay informed Our [LOCATION]5 newsletter recaps our reporting and other must-read coverage of local issues. Delivered [LOCATION]6. In fact, nothing in the law prevents - or even discourages - landlords from screening tenants. An entire section of the law is dedicated to landlords rights. They can turn down anyone who cant afford the rent or whose neighbors have complained about them. They can check an applicants references, credit score and history of evictions. And, in a concession to smaller landlords, the law exempts owner-occupied doubles and triples, which make up a substantial portion of [ORGANIZATION]s housing stock. [ORGANIZATION]s fair housing ordinance goes further than state and federal law, which prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, and religion, among other categories, adding gender identity and lawful source of income - Section 8, [ORGANIZATION]0 benefits, housing assistance from [ORGANIZATION]1. But this comes with a catch victims of source of income discrimination cant take their complaints to state or federal agencies. Until recently, they could only go to the city. In [DATE], [PERSON] passed8 a fair housing law with similar source of income protections. Among those the law is meant to protect are the almost 9,000 households in [ORGANIZATION] - almost 20,000 people - who depend on Section 8 to help pay their rent, according to data from [ORGANIZATION]2. Almost 40 percent are families with children. [DATE] are elderly. Sixty-five percent are African American, as are almost all the people whove filed discrimination complaints. Refusing to rent to Section 8 recipients is often a subtler [STREET] of refusing to rent to black people, advocates say.Examples of discriminationIn theory, Section 8 - officially [ORGANIZATION] - allows recipients to live wherever they can afford the rent, giving them the chance to move out of distressed neighborhoods to places with more job opportunities, better schools and less crime. In reality, that choice is limited. Some neighborhoods are too expensive, even with a voucher. The average income of a Section 8 household is just 13,000 a year - less than half the city average. Voucher holders put roughly 30 percent of their [LOCATION]7 income towards the rent the subsidy covers the rest, up to a cap set by the federal government. Apartments have to pass an [LOCATION]8 safety inspection working heat and hot water, no fraying electrical wires, no broken windows or rotting porch steps. Some landlords complain that the inspections require jumping through too many bureaucratic hoops, and that repairs are costly. There are benefits for landlords, though. Theyre guaranteed to receive the portion of rent covered by the subsidy [LOCATION]9, via direct deposit. And the program creates a safety net if a voucher holder loses their job, for instance, the rental assistance increases. Still, many landlords flatly refuse to take Section 8. Scrolling through rental listings online, a voucher holder will find dozens that tell her to keep looking no rental assistance, no pets, no Section 8! DOES NOT ACCEPT SECTION 8. Other landlords accept Section 8, but selectively, steering voucher holders to certain neighborhoods. At [ORGANIZATION]3, one of the citys biggest landlords, property managers said the companys two stately apartment buildings on [ORGANIZATION], near FAC1, were not Section 8 approved, according to one complaint. Instead, they suggested a shabbier residential complex in a neighborhood where the poverty rate is almost twice as high. The case against [ORGANIZATION]4 is still unresolved through an attorney, the company declined to comment. [ORGANIZATION]3 refused to accept Section 8 at this apartment building on [ORGANIZATION]. Photo by [ORGANIZATION], they suggested a more modest residential complex in a poorer neighborhood. Photo by PERSON5 The wait for a voucher lasts [ORGANIZATION]. Demand for the program far outstrips the federal funding available. None of [ORGANIZATION]s Section 8 agencies is currently taking new applications. Once off the waiting list, new voucher holders have a window of time - [ORGANIZATION]0, depending on the agency - to use the voucher, or risk losing it altogether. As rents rise, this is becoming more common. At [ORGANIZATION]5, one of the citys Section 8 agencies, almost a quarter of the people coming off the waiting list lost their vouchers [ORGANIZATION]1 - a sharp increase, managers say. [PERSON] found herself in this position after a property management company refused to take her voucher at an apartment in South [ORGANIZATION]. She had been turned down because of her Section 8 twice already, she told [ORGANIZATION]. With time running out, all I wanted to do was get into that apartment and pretty much save my [ORGANIZATION]6, she said, referring to her Section 8. Instead, she said, she lost her voucher. Its been more than three [ORGANIZATION] since the city concluded that she had been discriminated against. In that time, the company she filed the complaint against has closed down. One of the final entries in her case file notes that, [ORGANIZATION]3, the fair housing officer said her complaint was still being worked on.Inept city bureaucracyMost of [ORGANIZATION] case files tell a similar story a complaint is filed, substantiated by testing and sent to the city. Then, phone calls to city officials go unreturned, excuses are made, [ORGANIZATION]4 pass, and the case fizzles out. Almost every step of the citys process for handling discrimination complaints has broken down at some point. Stack them all up and the pile of complaints isnt that large. Voucher holders and advocates say discrimination is pervasive, but it goes mostly unreported, national research shows. Between [LOCATION]4, when the law went into effect, and the end of [ORGANIZATION]1, the city received at least 25 complaints - roughly two a year. By the time the city receives a complaint, [ORGANIZATION] has already done most of the investigative work. Its then up to the citys fair housing officer to determine whether theres probable cause that discrimination occurred. In 10 cases, the citys sloppy record keeping makes it unclear whether this ever happened. In response to a Freedom of Information request, the city provided records for just four complaints, none of them complete. Several cases were abandoned after the person who filed the complaint lost touch with [ORGANIZATION], or, in one instance, became homeless. Findings of discrimination, when they do come, take almost three times longer, on average, than [ORGANIZATION]7 the law allows. If a landlord is found to have discriminated, the fair housing officer is supposed to bring the parties together for settlement talks. In many cases, theres no record of this happening, according to a review of [ORGANIZATION] case files. One landlord told ORG2 she settled her case for 20, with no requirement that she attend fair housing training - although she acknowledged that she hadnt known about the law. [ORGANIZATION], which filed the complaint after finding an ad she had posted on [LOCATION], for a classy, comfy home saying sorry, no section 8 applicants accepted, was never informed of the settlement. If the landlord isnt willing to settle, the fair housing officer is supposed to send the complaint to the citys law department, which can take legal action seeking to impose fines or revoke rental licenses. In roughly a third of cases, the city has apparently failed to take action even after finding that a landlord has violated the law, [ORGANIZATION] records show. This reluctance is all the more striking given that the city pays [ORGANIZATION] to investigate discrimination complaints, spending scarce federal grant money on work that goes unused. Its very frustrating to tell folks that this is what the law says, but the citys not enforcing it, said PERSON11, [ORGANIZATION] associate director and staff attorney. As more time goes by, theres less and less chance that folks will ever receive justice in a lot of these cases. PERSON12, the citys fair housing officer since [PERSON], says the complaint process works well. He disagreed that some cases never receive determinations, but refused to provide specifics. PERSON13 and PERSON14, when they served as state Attorney General, took action10 against several landlords11 who turned Section 8 recipients away. The city, by contrast, has apparently taken legal action against a landlord only once, records and interviews show, and only after ORG2 began making inquiries. In [DATE] DATE5, PERSON15 was evicted from an apartment in South [ORGANIZATION] after her landlords told her, via text message, that they would not fill out her Section 8 paperwork. The city took seven [ORGANIZATION]4 to reach a finding of discrimination. Reached by phone, PERSON16, who owns the property with his wife, declined to comment, saying the complaint was bogus. After settlement talks fell apart [ORGANIZATION]3, PERSON17 didnt hear from the city for [ORGANIZATION]4. She wondered if filing the complaint had been worth it. Finally, in [ORGANIZATION]1, city attorneys filed a lawsuit against the PERSON18, seeking 4,500 in fines and a [ORGANIZATION]2 suspension of their rental licenses. For victims of discrimination, the stakes are high, and when the city fails to act, they have few options. The law gives them the right to take legal action against a landlord independently, but going to [STREET] is costly and time-consuming. Only one case has so far been resolved this [STREET]. After [ORGANIZATION]7 refused to take her voucher at an apartment in North [ORGANIZATION], PERSON19 rushed to find somewhere else before she ran out of time, according to an affidavit filed in the case. The [STREET] shed wanted was close to the shops and restaurants of FAC2. Instead, she ended up in an apartment building on [PERSON], on [ORGANIZATION], where the hallways smelled of sewage and were littered with used condoms, she said in the affidavit. The police were often called to the building on drug raids, sometimes breaking down apartment doors. She could hear sounds and fights related to prostitution through the thin apartment walls. In [ORGANIZATION]3, a state [ORGANIZATION]8 judge awarded PERSON20 almost 10,000 in damages. The city never decided whether she had been discriminated against.Shortcomings documentedIts not news to the PERSON21 administration that the fair housing law has gone almost entirely unenforced. A [ORGANIZATION]4 report by [ORGANIZATION] found inconsistent staffing of key positions related to fair housing. In [ORGANIZATION], a study by researchers at [ORGANIZATION]9 noted that no records of fines, civil penalties, or other enforcement actions have been maintained since the adoption of the ordinance. In [ORGANIZATION]5, the citys own federally required fair housing plan registered12 concerns that the law was mostlysymbolic and warned13 of limited funding, limited political will and a lack of coordination within and across various agencies The city has never filed the [LOCATION]8 reports on its fair housing caseload that the law requires. A landlord training manual14 on the citys website doesnt mention the laws key provision. A link to a discrimination complaint form takes [ORGANIZATION] to a ORG20 form, although federal law doesnt include source of income protections. Many landlords say they dont know about the law, and the city doesnt take advantage of obvious opportunities to educate them. ORG21 is supposed to ensure that owners of apartment buildings certify that theyre fully aware of the law. A process to do so was never put in [STREET], one city official said. The city requires smaller landlords to register their rental properties, but doesnt tell them about the fair housing law during the sign-up process, according to city officials and registered landlords. PERSON22, the fair housing officer, said he distributes copies of the law at the citys foreclosure auctions. Three [ORGANIZATION] ago, frustrated at the citys inaction, fair housing advocates tried to make the case for enforcing the law in person, emails and memos show. But the first city attorney they met with, in [PERSON], was reassigned, soon afterwards, to traffic [STREET]. A second attorney told them that [ORGANIZATION]7 that hed been given the go-ahead to take legal action in one of the cases, but - after several [ORGANIZATION]4 of confusion - they learned he had left to work for the [ORGANIZATION] Board of Education. By [DATE] of DATE5, city attorneys had bad news. Many of the complaints were now more than three [ORGANIZATION] old too old to prosecute, they argued, because the statute of limitations had expired. The housing advocates were dismayed. The city had sat on these cases for [ORGANIZATION], and now the lawyers were saying it was too late to act on them. After setting new deadlines for the more recent cases, a third attorney assigned to work on fair housing left. PERSON23 filed a complaint against ORG23 .... in [DATE]1, and city records show the fair housing officer found probable cause of discrimination. ORG23 representatives denied the allegations in a meeting with the city, according to [ORGANIZATION] case file. While the records show that the fair housing officer referred the case to the corporation counsels office, theres no indication the city took any formal enforcement action. After [ORGANIZATION] of following up and waiting, PERSON24 stopped calling [ORGANIZATION] to ask about her complaint, not wanting to be a nuisance. It wasnt the first time she had been turned down because of her voucher, and it wouldnt be the last. I could make 10 phone calls right now, she said, and at least six of them would come back and say, No Section 8.  The post [ORGANIZATION] not enforcing its fair housing law16 appeared first on ORG217.

buffalo,2020-12-10T00:00:00Z,VentureBeat,WGRZ,homeless,[ORGANIZATION] votes to prohibit businesses from using facial recognition without public notice,"In the wake of the ORG0 movement, an increasing number of cities and states have expressed concerns about facial recognition technology and its applications. [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], GPE2 and [PERSON], [PERSON] are among the metros where law enforcement is prohibited from using facial recognition. In [PERSON], companies must get consent before collecting biometric information of any kind, including face images. GPE6 recently passed2 a moratorium on the use of biometric identification in schools until [ORGANIZATION], and lawmakers in [PERSON] have advanced a suspension3 of government use of any biometric surveillance system within the commonwealth. More recently, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] approved a ballot initiative banning the use of facial recognition by police and city agencies. The GPE6 City Council bill, which was sponsored by [PERSON]0 Councilman PERSON0, doesnt outright ban the use of facial recognition technologies by businesses. However, it does impose restrictions on the ways brick-and-mortar locations like retailers, which might use facial recognition to prevent theft or personalize certain services, can deploy it. Businesses that fail to post a warning about collecting biometric data must pay 500. Businesses found selling data will face fines of 5,000. In this aspect, the bill falls short of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] recently-passed ordinance regarding biometric data collection, which bans all private use of biometric data in places of public accommodation, including stores, banks, restaurants, public transit stations, homeless shelters, doctors offices, rental properties, retirement homes, and a variety of other types of businesses excepting workplaces_. Its scheduled to take effect starting DATE1. I commend ORG2 for protecting GPE6ers from facial recognition and other biometric tracking. No one should have to risk being profiled by a racist algorithm just for buying milk at the neighborhood store, [PERSON], executive director of [ORGANIZATION], said. While this is just a first step towards comprehensively banning biometric surveillance, its a crucial one. We shouldnt allow giant companies to sell our biometric data simply because we want to buy necessities. Far too many companies use biometric surveillance systems to profile customers of color, even though they are biased. If companies dont comply with the new law, we have a simple message well see you in [STREET]. Numerous studies and [PERSON] ownanalyses4of public benchmark data have shown facial recognition algorithms are susceptible to bias. One issue is that the data sets used to train the algorithms skew white and male. [ORGANIZATION]found5that 81 of people in the three face-image collections most widely cited in academic studies have lighter-colored skin. Academics have found that photographic technology and techniques can also favor lighter skin, including everything from sepia-tinged film to low-contrast digital cameras. The algorithms are often misused in the field, as well, which tends to amplify their underlying biases. Areport6from [ORGANIZATION] details how police feed facial recognition software flawed data, including composite sketches and pictures of celebrities who share physical features with suspects. The GPE6 [INSTITUTION] and othersreportedly7edit photos with blur effects and 3D modelers to make them more conducive to algorithmic face searches. ORG7, [ORGANIZATION], and ORG9 have self-imposed moratoriums on the sale of facial recognition systems. But some vendors, like [ORGANIZATION]0 and [PERSON]1-based [ORGANIZATION]1, are aiming to fill the gap with customers, including [PERSON]2 and [ORGANIZATION]2.  1 38utm_mediumnov-19-sidebaramp38utm_contenttext-linkamp38utm_campaigndec-10-logmein-webinar  2  3  4  5  6  7"

She survived the lethality of racist policy survived breast cancer like my mother and partner, at a time when Black women are the most likely to die of that disease. But [ORGANIZATION] wasnt able to survive racist violence. For Black people to survive both racist policy and racist violence is grueling. To live as a Black [ORGANIZATION]n is to be a survivor.[PERSON] isnt ready to truly understand the [PERSON] shooting[ORGANIZATION]s killer denied all this. Racist theories deny the racist structure of [ORGANIZATION]n policies, the ubiquity of racist violence, and the obvious and ongoing structural violence revealed by racial disparities. The heartbeat of being racist is denial. The deeper the denial, the more diabolical the racist theory.The most diabolical of all racist ideas operating [ORGANIZATION]-the theory reaching the very depths of denialism, the theory that replaces reality perhaps more than any other-is the [ORGANIZATION] theory, or [ORGANIZATION], a white-supremacist conspiracy theory cited in a screed linked to the [PERSON] shooter. But versions of [ORGANIZATION] have also been spread by [ORGANIZATION], PERSON4, and many other powerful political and media figures in GPE2 [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] denies the greatest white privilege life itself. It denies the greatest Black deprivation life itself.[ORGANIZATION] theorists believe that Democrats, liberals, progressives, immigrants, Black people, Asians, Latino people, Muslims, abortionists, and Jews are trying to replace the native-born and original white populations in their countries. No longer would I just accept our replacement, the author of the [PERSON] screed said. No longer would I just accept our genocide. No longer will I willingly serve the people who are trying to end me and my race. I would have to take the fight to the replacers myself.What group did the [PERSON] shooter choose to target? He selected an obvious, visible, and large group of replacers. He chose Black people, he explained, because all black people are replacers just by existing in [LOCATION] countries.Imagine how much a white supremacist has to replace reality in order to believe that white people-who remain on the higher end of nearly every racial disparity-are being killed off, that they are being replaced, that they are being harmed, and that to protect themselves, they need to attack the very Black people who are actually on the lower end of nearly every racial disparity. The [ORGANIZATION] theory wholly replaces reality, presenting the dying as the living, and the living as the dying.Black people are more likely than white people to die in pregnancy, before their first birthdays, and from heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, strokes, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease, and [ORGANIZATION] of the 10 leading causes of death in GPE2.From [PERSON], the overall life expectancy in GPE2 fell by [PERSON], the steepest decline since World War II. Latino [ORGANIZATION]ns and Black [ORGANIZATION]ns saw the largest drop in life expectancy [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], respectively, while white [ORGANIZATION]ns faced the smallest decline [ORGANIZATION], according to a report from the CDC.From the [ORGANIZATION] issue [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION] can be hazardous to your healthThe racial disparities in life expectancy had been narrowing for [LOCATION]0. In [LOCATION]1, white [ORGANIZATION]ns expected to live [LOCATION]2 than Black [ORGANIZATION]ns. In [LOCATION]3, the gap was [LOCATION]4. But the disproportionate impact of [ORGANIZATION] people reversed the trend. In [LOCATION]5, white [ORGANIZATION]ns were expected to live [LOCATION]6 longer than Black [ORGANIZATION]ns.According to a preliminary analysis, life expectancy in GPE2 continued to decline in [LOCATION]7, while bouncing back in other wealthy countries. This continued [PERSON] decline was almost entirely driven by deaths among white [ORGANIZATION]ns, according to estimates-not because people of color are replacing them but, in part, because white people accounted for a larger share of people opposing [PERSON] vaccines and the policies that reduce the spread of the disease, according to researchers. Some of the very people pushing the [ORGANIZATION] theory were convincing their white viewers, readers, and constituents to resist shutdowns, to not wear masks, to not get vaccinated. Why? As my ORG2 colleague PERSON5 observed back in May [LOCATION]5 To restrict the freedom of white [ORGANIZATION]ns, just because nonwhite [ORGANIZATION]ns are dying, is an egregious violation of the racial contract.Tragically, white people are still dying of racist whiteness and blaming their deaths on Black and Latino people, who are dying at even higher rates from the same racist whiteness-its structural violence, its unending terror, its vicious neglect. The most prominent [ORGANIZATION] theorists, who claim to care about white lives, dont seem to care about white lives as they pour toxic disinformation and racist ideas into white communities, causing many white people to hardly care about people of color. If theres anything white people should have learned from the pandemic, it is this To not care about people of color is to not care about people.Before I begin I will say that I was not born racist nor grew up to be racist, the screed said. I simply became racist after I learned the truth.PERSON6 [LOCATION] power, white violenceThe [PERSON] killer started to be racist when he learned to deny the truth. The historical truth is that racist policy has allowed white [ORGANIZATION]ns to enjoy remarkable unearned privilege. Efforts to roll back racist policy, to create equity, are not an attack on white people but an attack on racism. As white privileges are rolled back, the privileges of living in a democratic, healthy, safe, equitable, and just society are rolled forward for everyone in the society, including white people.But n [ORGANIZATION] theorists refuse to acknowledge all the porous conditions and policies causing white people to die at high rates from all the leading causes of death-and people of color to die at even higher rates. They refuse to discuss racial disparities in mortality, in life expectancy. But if communities of color are particularly vulnerable, they have also responded to death and harm and disease by caring for others. Latino [ORGANIZATION]ns 21 percent, African [ORGANIZATION]ns 20.3 percent, and Asian [ORGANIZATION]ns 19.7 percent have a higher reported prevalence of caregiving than [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]ns 16.9 percent. African [ORGANIZATION]n caregivers are more likely to experience high burdens from caregiving than their white peers, and on average, spend [TIME] per week on caregiving.[ORGANIZATION], the [LOCATION]9 mother of a retired [PERSON] fire commissioner, visited her husband at a nursing home, a visit she made DATE20 without fail. After her visit on [ORGANIZATION], she stopped by [ORGANIZATION] for groceries. She was killed. PERSON8, DATE21, shopped all the time at [ORGANIZATION] for her brother and his family. We dont really have family in the area, so it was just a great help that she could do something for us like that, her brother, [ORGANIZATION], told [PERSON]. [PERSON] needed this help because he is recovering from leukemia. His sister was killed too.Black and Latino people with acute myeloid leukemia [ORGANIZATION] are more likely to die of the disease than white people. Structural racism assessed by census tract variables accounts for nearly all Black-[LOCATION] and Hispanic-[LOCATION] disparity in [ORGANIZATION] survival, researchers found in a recent study in [LOCATION].Structural racism killed Black people in east [PERSON] and then the gunman killed the survivors. In DATE22, a local report found the [PERSON]-Niagara region to be one of the most segregated in the nation. Segregation imposes a wide range of costs on people of color, impairing their health, education, job access, and wealth, [LOCATION]. Individuals living in segregated neighborhoods tend to have less access to services that allow adequate standards of living, and their economic mobility is severely impaired. The neighborhood that the white supremacist targeted had long experienced food apartheid the [ORGANIZATION] grocery store was the only nearby source of fresh, nutritious food, reported The [PERSON] News.The victims of this white supremacist had been striving to address the effects of racist policy and make up for the lack of goods and services in this Black community. PERSON11 often drove people to this sole grocery store and had gone to the soup kitchen before going to [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION]. The white supremacist killed PERSON12 as he helped someone put packages in their car.PERSON13 The intersectionality of hatePearly Young-Miss Pearly, as the DATE23 was known-ran a food pantry in the area for DATE24. At church, she taught [LOCATION] school, worked with youth, and often cooked large pots of vegetable soup for everyone. PERSON14, a DATE25 member of a group called [ORGANIZATION], had written several letters to [PERSON] publications calling for stricter gun-control measures to keep her community safe. She was killed by a man armed with an assault rifle and the lethal idea that Black people like her were the replacers. The horror is unspeakable, like when enslavers cast themselves as benevolently paternal, and cast the enslaved, who they tortured, as violent beasts.It is one thing to deny the racist policy structure harming and killing Black people and other people. But the depths of racist denial are reached when white supremacists frame Black people as the primary perpetrators and white people as the primary victims of racial harm. This ideology stirs and justifies white-supremacist terror and the terrible veiling of lethally racist policy structure. Black people are facing the double terror of racist policy and racist violence. Victims of racism are being mass murdered again and again.But through it all, through all the pain and mourning, through all the [ORGANIZATION] theories replacing reality, Black people have been like the victims of this latest mass murder finding bliss with [PERSON], caring for the sick and shut in, and never wavering in our anti-racist resistance. Black people have never wavered in our efforts to abolish the double terror, have never wavered in our struggle to live, have never wavered in allying with other people facing similar racist terrors, have never wavered in the human pursuit of joy, of peace, of beauty. And we never will."

We have to quickly dispense with the notion that [ORGANIZATION]5, [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION], and ORG9 are private entities that can do what they want.

The main impetus for the initiative had originated in long-standing grievances of some ethnic groups living within [ORGANIZATION]an Union member states, as well as [ORGANIZATION]4 candidate countries.

Appealing to centrist so-called constructors who could replace PERSON80, the premier called for the limpid backing of liberals, popular party members and socialists. PERSON81 said former premier [ORGANIZATION]7 whom he blamed for a grave act of irresponsibility had opened a crisis that must find in this forum its clarification with transparency with respect to the clear action which marked my mandate. PERSON81 is seeking enough so-called constructors to replace PERSON80 crucially in the ORG94 where he no longer has a majority and where he will face the second of the two confidence votes on [ORGANIZATION]. We need the widest possible consensus among willing forces, PERSON81 said as he addressed the possible constructors who could save his executive. PERSON81 said the crisis had dissipated energies in sterile polemics that it was without any foundation, and that the government had improved the [PERSON] Recovery Plan which [ORGANIZATION]7 had cited as the reason for his defection. He said the use of the [ORGANIZATION]an Stability Mechanism for health spending doesnt come into it. The premier said the crisis had damaged the country, and what has happened cannot be cancelled, effectively rebuffing [ORGANIZATION]7s tentative overtures to do a U-turn and return to the administration he brought down. PERSON81 said GPE52 deserves a cohesive government and called on lawmakers to now help it turn the page. He said the Recovery Plan would be a collective and shared effort. PERSON81 said that his aim was to continue to bring about reform, From the start I worked for the creation of the prospect of a board, courageous design for DATE51 of reform based on sustainability, social and territorial cohesion and the full development of the human person, PERSON81 said as he appealed to the lawmakers to back his executive, That vision is still present [ORGANIZATION]6.

The premier faces the first of two crunch confidence votes in the lower chamber, with an even stiffer test coming in the ORG94 on [ORGANIZATION] if his executive survives in the ORG70 on [ORGANIZATION]. He is set to appeal to so-called constructor lawmakers from outside the ruling coalition to vote for the government and stop it collapsing in the middle of the [PERSON]-10 pandemic. The two senior partners in the ruling coalition, ORG96 and the centre-left [PERSON] ORG98, have already rejected the idea of patching things up with ex-premier [ORGANIZATION]7. But the ORG98 has kept the door open to individual PERSON80 lawmakers and two have said that they will break ranks from the centrist group. The centre-right opposition has called for snap elections, arguing that, even if the government survives the confidence votes, if will be too weak to effectively rule the country. Life Senator and Holocaust survivor [ORGANIZATION] said she will defy medical advice and will be in [LOCATION] to vote for the government, describing the crisis as incomprehensible.181 PERSON84 Appeals for Rejection of Evil Attacking GPE60182 Ruling ORG90 ORG91 leader [PERSON], while speaking at a church in GPE59 in southern GPE60, warned those gathered that an evil is attacking GPE60 and the [ORGANIZATION]00.

PERSON86 and [ORGANIZATION]4 arent political twins. But PERSON86, perhaps sensing which [STREET] the wind is blowing, has come a long [STREET] since DATE28, when he was saluted as the antidote to the nationalism of PERSON90 and Donald [ORGANIZATION], PERSON88 writes.

Another potential enforcement measure would be to copy GPE60s so-called enhanced monitoring system for those who are supposed to be self-isolating.191 [PERSON] Liberal Democrats to Campaign to Bring Back [ORGANIZATION]4 Free Movement192 The leader of [ORGANIZATION]11, which branded the Leave vote a national humiliation, is campaigning to bring back freedom of movement with the [ORGANIZATION]4, opening up migration to an unlimited number of [ORGANIZATION]ans to live and work in the [PERSON]. PERSON93 took over as leader of [ORGANIZATION]11 after the partys embarrassing losses under former leader PERSON94, who campaigned to force the [PERSON] to stay in the [ORGANIZATION]4 if they won enough seats to take control of [ORGANIZATION]12. Without regret, after PERSON95 had lost her own constituency in the DATE21 DATE83 poll, she said that she was proud that Liberal Democrats were the unapologetic voice of Remain.193 [PERSON] Police Chief Now is Really Not the Time For Free Speech, Protest194 The chief constable of [ORGANIZATION]13 has urged lockdown protesters to accept that now is really not the time for freedom of speech and the right to assembly.195 [PERSON] Will This Crp Ever End? Gardening is Racist, [ORGANIZATION] Professor196 The British pastime of gardening is rooted in racial injustice, a professor who has been active in a [ORGANIZATION]14-style iconoclastic push in [ORGANIZATION]15 has claimed.

Distressing details of the aftermath of the DATE28 radical [ORGANIZATION]6ic terror attack reveal that PERSON99 was not killed instantly when suicide bomber [ORGANIZATION]00, who had been ferried to GPE65 from GPE66 by [ORGANIZATION]17 in [ORGANIZATION]4, triggered his bomb, as was previously believed, but remained conscious for over an hour, and may have survived her injuries if she had received adequate medical attention.199 [PERSON] Khans GPE67 Up to Forty Males Fight [STREET] Battle With Swords, Knives, [PERSON] Bottles200 A mob of up to 40 males fought a running battle on the streets of GPE67 with swords, knives, and broken bottles, despite [LOCATION]s draconian anti-coronavirus lockdown. [ORGANIZATION]18 officers covering GPE69 reported on social media that they had responded to a large fight in GPE70 involving up to 40 males fighting with swords and bottles, managing to chase two from the scene and detained them after they were identified as having carried swords during the fight.201 [PERSON] Left-Wing [ORGANIZATION]19 Names and Shames Tory MPs Who Joined Far-Right OR[ORGANIZATION]7202 GPE65s leading left-wing newspaper The [ORGANIZATION]19 has published a list of Conservative MPs and prominent personalities who joined the social media platform OR[ORGANIZATION]7, which the newspaper claims is favoured by the far-right and [ORGANIZATION] supporters. The [ORGANIZATION]20 the [ORGANIZATION]5 edition of GPE65s [ORGANIZATION]19 newspaper claimed that at least 14 Conservative MPs had joined OR[ORGANIZATION]7 before it was disappeared off the internet, after being removed from ORG9 and [ORGANIZATION]0 Play app stores, and [ORGANIZATION] Web Services ultimately pulling the companys access to their internet servers. The social media network has since insisted it will be back soon.203 [PERSON] Minister [PERSON] Can be Lifted by DATE27 to be Replaced by Tiers Again204 A senior minister has confirmed that lockdown restrictions will go on at least until DATE27, when he hopes that they will start to be lifted and replaced by the tiered system again. [LOCATION] went into its third lockdown on DATE2 4th and while initially, Prime Minister [ORGANIZATION]8 would not give a firm deadline suggesting mid-[DATE] if things go well the emergency legislation passed on [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]8 made the measures legally enforceable until [DATE]. Though Mr [ORGANIZATION]01 claimed that he did not believe restrictions would be needed for that long, the [PERSON] was effectively put in a state of shutdown for up to three [ORGANIZATION]7.205 [PERSON] Statues to be [ORGANIZATION] Purges206 Historical monuments and statues in GPE65 will be granted new legal protections from baying mobs and the revisionist purges carried out by left-wing [ORGANIZATION]25-controlled councils, [ORGANIZATION]26 Secretary [ORGANIZATION]02 announced on [ORGANIZATION]5. Mr [ORGANIZATION]03 said that the change in law will mandate that all memorials, monuments, historical statues, plaques, and [STREET] names will have to go through an official planning process, rather than being left to the mercy of local [ORGANIZATION]27-run councils.207 [PERSON] When [PERSON] Theories Come True [ORGANIZATION]5 Times Under Fire for Branding [PERSON] Vax Passports as Freedom Certificates208 [ORGANIZATION]09 is facing a social media backlash for pushing [PERSON]-19 vaccination passports as freedom certificates with many noting that the idea was considered a crazy conspiracy theory only a few [ORGANIZATION]7 ago.209 [ORGANIZATION] in British Hospital210 [ORGANIZATION]04, a key aide to Polish President [ORGANIZATION]05, will intervene with the British Ambassador to GPE60 in an attempt to help the family of a comatose Pole in a British hospital facing the end of life support. Acting on the authority of the Polish president, I will meet British Ambassador [ORGANIZATION]06 to discuss the case of the Pole in a coma in a GPE71 hospital, tweeted [ORGANIZATION]04 on [ORGANIZATION]5. The middle-aged Polish man who has lived in [LOCATION] for over ten [LOCATION]s was admitted to hospital in DATE72 having suffered cardiac arrest for [TIME], during which, according to the hospitals authorities, the individual suffered permanent brain damage. The hospital therefore applied to [STREET] for permission to terminate his life support.211 Second Dose in [LOCATION] After ORG29 Vaccine Reportedly Leaves Dozen Israelis With Facial Paralysis212 At least 13 Israelis have suffered mild facial paralysis as a side effect after getting the ORG29 vaccine, media reported, citing health ministry officials. According to Israeli news site [ORGANIZATION]29, doctors estimate that the number of similar cases could be higher and are questioning if they should administer the second dose of the vaccine to those who suffered facial paralysis. However, [ORGANIZATION] recommends they should go ahead, but only if the paralysis passes, the report says.213 LOC8 Hit by Icy Blast as Snow Blankets Parts of GPE72 The LOC9 desert has been hit by an icy blast with temperatures dipping below freezing. Snow also blanketed parts of GPE73 which saw the mercury hit 28 degrees [ORGANIZATION]. A photographer has captured images of camels after a snowfall in the GPE74 region in northwestern GPE73.

Relatives left the village on [ORGANIZATION]1 29, while [ORGANIZATION]11 stayed behind. Azeri forces later captured the village and following the ceasefire agreement she was reported missing. When [ORGANIZATION]11s body was discovered, it had been mutilated nearly beyond recognition. Her brother [ORGANIZATION]13 only recognized her by her clothing. Relatives also reported that [ORGANIZATION]14s feet, hands and ears had been cut off as part of her torture. These types of atrocities are reminiscent of those committed during previous pogroms and genocides against the Armenian Christian community. [ORGANIZATION]14 is one of many Armenians who were killed needlessly at the hands of Azeri forces in the GPE77 region. Azerbaijans dehumanization of Armenian Christians is also influenced by [PERSON]0. It is a combination which builds concern for the remaining Armenian Christian community in GPE77.219 [PERSON]2 Wants to Prosecute Online Blasphemy Committed Abroad220 [PERSON]2 is threatening to prosecute non-[PERSON]2is in foreign countries for breaking its blasphemy laws online. The country, which is no stranger to censorship, seems to be copying [PERSON]3, which also tries to prosecute foreigners found guilty of criticizing the Chinese communist party. The decision seems to be focused on [LOCATION], an [ORGANIZATION]6ic sect whose beliefs are considered blasphemous in [PERSON]2. The [PERSON]2 Telecommunications Authority PTA sent a legal notice to [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]A demanding that it shuts down its website, [URL] , or get charged with blasphemy, a crime that carries a ten-[LOCATION] prison sentence.221 Chinese-[PERSON] Socialite Who Rubbed Elbows With [ORGANIZATION]15 Jumps to Her Death222 Chinese-[PERSON] socialite [ORGANIZATION]16, DATE78, jumped to her death from her penthouse in [PERSON]4 on [DATE].

Both died immediately after the fall.223 [ORGANIZATION] Christians Killed for Their Faith Increased by 60 Percent in DATE80 For [LOCATION]s I have been warning that Christian persecution was rising all over the globe, but we have never seen anything like the past [LOCATION]. Christians are being slaughtered all across [LOCATION]0, they are being taken to concentration camps in [PERSON]5, thousands of churches have been brutally shut down under a new wave of persecution in [PERSON]3, and millions of believers throughout [LOCATION]1 must live knowing that each new day may be their last. Of course most [ORGANIZATION] have never heard about any of this because the mainstream media wont cover it. Thankfully, there are organizations that do keep track of what is happening to Christians around the globe, and one of them is [ORGANIZATION]34[PERSON]A. According to the group, the number of Christians that were killed for their faith was 60 percent higher in [LOCATION]6 than it was in DATE83 The watchdog organization [ORGANIZATION]34[PERSON]A says levels of Christian persecution are at a record high around the world. [ORGANIZATION]34 reports that levels of Christian persecution are at a record high, revealing that the number of Christians murdered for their faith rose 60 percent in [LOCATION]6. A 6 percent rise in a single [LOCATION] would be bad. A 60 percent increase is a nightmare.225 [ORGANIZATION] Which [DATE] Explain How Animals See Magnetic Fields for [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION]35 claim to have observed a reaction showing quantum physics directly impacting biochemistry, which they suspect explains how certain animals can perceive the Earths magnetic field. Researchers have long suspected that some part of various animals visual systems, including migratory birds, allows them to perceive the Earths magnetic fields, affording them the ability to navigate vast distances during migratory periods, but have never been able to find the mechanism. Until now, that is. The [ORGANIZATION]36 team used a custom microscope, which can detect extremely faint flashes of light, on a culture of human cells which contained an extremely light-sensitive material that can respond to changes in a magnetic field. Photoreceptors, called cryptochromes, are found in the cells of numerous species, including migratory birds and dogs and, curiously, humans.227 The [PERSON]4 Migrants Fleeing to the [PERSON]228 The [PERSON] will introduce a new visa at the end of DATE2 that will give 5.4 million [PERSON]4 residents a staggering 70 of the territorys population the right to come and live in the [PERSON], and eventually become citizens. It is making this generous offer to residents of its former colony because it believes [PERSON]3 is undermining [PERSON]4s rights and freedoms. Not everyone will come. Some of those eligible to leave have expressed their determination to stay and continue the fight for democracy. In the end, GPE65 estimates that about 300,000 will take up the visa offer over [DATE] [LOCATION]s.229 [PERSON] Scientist Who Led Charge Against [PERSON] Lab Leak Theory Admits He Was Trying to Protect Chinese Scientists230 The GPE7 scientist behind an effort to stymie debate surrounding the possibility that [ORGANIZATION] could have accidentally escaped from [ORGANIZATION]37 admitted through a spokesman that he did so to protect Chinese scientists from online criticism. Dr. [ORGANIZATION]18, the president of the GPE24-based [ORGANIZATION]38, orchestrated a statement published in [ORGANIZATION]39 in [DATE], prior to any serious research on the origins of [ORGANIZATION], condemning conspiracy theories that suggest the virus doesnt have a natural origin.231 Anti-Vaxxers Who Refuse [PERSON] Jab Could be Banned From Pubs, Restaurants or Even Their Workplaces Under Radical New Plan232 [PERSON]7 Premier [ORGANIZATION]19 has revealed she is considering implementing regulations that would prohibited residents who have not vaccinated from entering certain venues233 [PERSON]7 Records No New Coronavirus Cases Yet Again GPE95 [ORGANIZATION]ure Mounts on Paranoid Premiers to Open the Borders or Risk Losing Millions2DATE78 [PERSON]7 has reported zero locally acquired coronavirus cases on [ORGANIZATION] for DATE87 [PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION] Still Try to Solve the Mystery of How [PERSON] Spread Around the FAC12 Hotel in a Fortnight236 [PERSON]8 reported zero new locally acquired cases of coronavirus on [ORGANIZATION].237 Kidnapped Nigerian Catholic Priest Hacked to Death With Machetes238 A Nigerian Catholic priest abducted [LOCATION]3 was hacked to death with machetes by his kidnappers, according to a report [ORGANIZATION]. The lifeless body of Father [ORGANIZATION]20, a priest of [ORGANIZATION]40, in [PERSON]9 expansive [LOCATION]2, was discovered tied to a tree near the [STREET] where he had been kidnapped, so severely disfigured by machetes that recognition was difficult.239 [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] for Denouncing New World Order240 [ORGANIZATION]5 has censored a video of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]21, archbishop emeritus of GPE90, for suggesting that globalist leaders are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to bring about a new world order.241 [ORGANIZATION]22 PERSON90 GPE65 Must Get a Grip on Immigration242 Reform [PERSON] leader Nigel [ORGANIZATION]22 has said that [ORGANIZATION]8s government must get a grip not only on legal immigration, but stop the flow of illegal aliens from coming across [LOCATION]3. The [PERSON] saw nearly 8,500 illegals make it from [ORGANIZATION], predominantly GPE44, across [LOCATION]3 in small boats last [LOCATION]. A [ORGANIZATION]41 report from [LOCATION]3 revealed that the total number of attempted illegal crossings by boat including successful, intercepted, and where evidence of illegal crossing was found was 15,000 for the whole of [LOCATION]6.243 German Police Detain 23 Illegal Migrants, Hand Them Over to GPE91 German police discovered 23 migrants in three vans they stopped near the town of [PERSON] near the border with [LOCATION]. Twenty men and three women were crammed into a very small space, the [ORGANIZATION]42 news agency reported. All migrants and three smugglers were handed over to [LOCATION]. Police checked the vans on [ORGANIZATION] on the FAC13 motorway between the towns of [PERSON] and [PERSON], which lie five and ten kilometers, respectively, from the Czech town of GPE95. According to the German police, migrants and their smugglers were from GPE96. Two smugglers had a criminal record in GPE61 for [ORGANIZATION] Reportedly Defying [ORGANIZATION]4 [STREET] Ruling and Continues to [PERSON] to GPE97246 Despite a [ORGANIZATION]an [STREET] of Justice ruling, GPE50 continues to deport migrants to GPE97, [ORGANIZATION]44 reports. According to [ORGANIZATION]45, GPE50 continues to expel people. GPE50 has warned in the past that despite the top [ORGANIZATION]4 courts ruling, it would continue to defend its borders. The [ORGANIZATION]03-KDNP parliamentary majority and the government will do everything in its power to maintain the border fence, live military and police patrols and keep the transit zones operational, said Hungarian State Secretary of [ORGANIZATION]47 [ORGANIZATION]25 in [DATE] of last [LOCATION].247 Migrant [PERSON] Near GPE98 Border on Their [STREET] to the [PERSON]248 Thousands of Central [PERSON] migrants trekking to the [PERSON] are hoping to find a welcome mat at the southern border after President-elect [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]0 said he would start to unravel President [ORGANIZATION]s border and immigration policies on DATE90 in the [ORGANIZATION]6. The group of about 8,000 migrants made up of families and young children entered GPE98 on [ORGANIZATION] but encountered a line of ORGDATE78 troops and immigration officials who used tear gas and batons to halt their march across the country to the Mexican border and eventually into the [PERSON]. For now, the caravan remains stalled near the GPE98 border as [LOCATION]9s Inauguration Day nears.249 A Message to Anyone Who Feels Like [ORGANIZATION]26 In [ORGANIZATION]27 DATE92 The ideal set up by the [ORGANIZATION]48 was something huge, terrible, and glittering . . . all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting three hundred million people all with the same face.251 Activists [ORGANIZATION]0s Embrace of [ORGANIZATION] a Blow to Womens Rights252 President-Elect [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]0s promise to embrace transgender ideology will likely include supporting biological men who say their gender identity is female to compete in sports against biological women. Attorneys representing transgender athletes and women athletes expect [ORGANIZATION]0s [ORGANIZATION] to reverse course in two lawsuits in GPE18 and GPE100 that the [ORGANIZATION] administration had backed to protect womens rights.253 [ORGANIZATION] is Not a Free Speech Platform254 Many have flocked to [ORGANIZATION], a privacy-focused platform that resembles [ORGANIZATION]5, after the recent vast censorship from [ORGANIZATION]9 giants.

In addition, there is the explosion in the cost of rent and energy, which is contributing to the impoverishment of the middle class and those who are already below the poverty line. The government does not want to remove taxes on gasoline because it is good for the environment. Premier PERSON5, for his part, has decided to offer 500 to [PERSON]ers to help them with inflation. 66 18 [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, And ORG3 to be Sued Over [PERSON] by [PERSON] via [ORGANIZATION] emphasis ours [ORGANIZATION] has filed a lawsuit against [ORGANIZATION], on behalf of ORG6 and ORG7 employees, and plans to sue all major airlines, 18 altogether, plus ORG8 ORG2 and [ORGANIZATION], contending that the vaccine mandates imposed by these agencies on the airlines employees infringed on their constitutional, religious, and medical liberties. The lawsuit against [ORGANIZATION] was filed in federal [STREET] in [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION], with over 100 plaintiffs pursuing litigation.

Citizens of the state can now connect their ID and drivers licenses to [PERSON]3 Wallet to get a digital identification. A similar feature has already been rolled out in GPE7. At certain [PERSON]4 checkpoints at airports participating in the program like FAC0 and GPE3 International, residents of [ORGANIZATION] can use their iPhone or [PERSON]3 Watch to verify their identity. The digital ID will not replace the physical ID. The states website clearly states that law enforcement will not accept the mobile ID, meaning residents still have to carry their physical ID anyway. 72 Authorities Investigating Whether Retired Federal Agent Had Advanced Notice of GPE8 Shooting73 Authorities are reportedly investigating whether a retired federal agent, who allegedly regularly communicated with GPE8 supermarket shooter [LOCATION]0 online, had [TIME] advanced notice that the [ORGANIZATION] shooting would occur.

Among the highlights, [LOCATION]0 told guests at [PERSON], I thank all of you for being here, and I want you to enjoy the rest of the recession. In a speech before an audience of policemen, [LOCATION]0 asked, How many police officers have multiple time and put a lion and had to do things that theyd have to think theyd have to do? Whereas [LOCATION]8 domestic policy malapropisms are generally subjects of amusement or derision with few consequences, the same cannot be said of his parallel misstatements when it comes to foreign policy. Consider the war in [PERSON]1. In [LOCATION], as [LOCATION]n troops were situated on the border with [PERSON]1 awaiting [LOCATION]n President [LOCATION]1 marching orders, [LOCATION]0 gave a press conference in which he exposed ORG28 disagreements by noting that the alliance would be divided over how to respond to a minor incursion by [LOCATION]n forces. Confusion, and worse, impulsiveness, have been the hallmarks of [LOCATION]8 decisions no less than his pronouncements. The helter-skelter withdrawal of [PERSON]2 forces from [PERSON]3 [ORGANIZATION] remains the paramount example of the impulsive nature of [LOCATION]8 foreign policy. [LOCATION]0 ordered [PERSON]2 forces to withdraw, ending a DATE9 war in humiliation and defeat without first coordinating the move with [PERSON]2 allies [DATE] [STREET] Ordered Release of [ORGANIZATION] Document Reveals 82  97 of [ORGANIZATION] A recently released confidential document reveals that a startling majority of in utero babies died after pregnant women were injected with the [ORGANIZATION] vaccine. [ORGANIZATION] requested documents related to vaccine licensing via a Freedom of Information Act Request, then sued ORG31 ORG32. In [LOCATION]0, a federal judge ordered the ORG32 incrementally release the documents it claimed would take [LOCATION]1 to process. ORG30 has posted [ORGANIZATION]s confidential documents as they have become available. In the most recent release, on [LOCATION]2, a document titled reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf disclosed on page 12 that by [LOCATION]3, 270 women had received the mRNA injection during pregnancy. But 238 cases were apparently not followed no outcome provided. And, therefore, the pregnancy outcomes for those women are unknown. The mere fact that 88 of the pregnant women injected were not followed throughout their pregnancies is deeply concerning since 1[ORGANIZATION]7 of the 270 pregnant women had some type of adverse reaction [DATE] nonserious, 75 serious according to page 12 of the same document. Among those 34 pregnancies that are known, the report indicates that 28 babies died either in utero or upon birth. Only one outcome was reported as normal, and the remaining five were reported as pending. 85 [PERSON]4 Police [LOCATION]4 Wanted for Stabbing Teen Girl Dies While Being Taken Into Custody86 [PERSON]5, [LOCATION]  [PERSON]4 police say a [LOCATION]5 suspect wanted for stabbing a teen girl died as officers were attempting to bring him into custody. According to a news release, [LOCATION]2 died at ORG34 in [PERSON]6 early [ORGANIZATION]5 morning. The ordeal began around 830 p.m. [ORGANIZATION] when [PERSON]4 officers were called to [PERSON] for a stabbing. They discovered a [LOCATION]6 girl outside of the home, bleeding from multiple stab wounds to her arms, legs and head. She was rushed to the hospital and is in stable condition. Investigators found a bloody knife inside the home. Witnesses provided police a description of [LOCATION]3 and a K9 team tracked him, eventually finding him facedown in the backyard of a FAC5 property. As [LOCATION]3 was being taken into custody, he became unresponsive, police say. Medics revived him before he was taken to ORG35. The [PERSON]7 ORG36 office will perform an autopsy on [LOCATION]3s body in order to determine the exact cause of death 87 [LOCATION]5 The Right to Bear Arms is an Important Safeguard Against Potential Tyranny of Government88 Space X and ORG37 CEO [LOCATION]5 stated in a [LOCATION]7 interview that, while he espouses the idea of strict background checks and licenses for certain firearm owners, people should generally be free to own and bear firearms in [PERSON]8. 89 [LOCATION]5 [PERSON] to Ask Her Followers Whos More Trustworthy Billionaires or Politicians90 The social media feud between [PERSON]2woman [LOCATION]6 D-[PERSON]9 and ORG37 CEO [LOCATION]5 continued [LOCATION]7 when [LOCATION]7 dared the politician to create a poll asking her followers who they find more trustworthy, billionaires or politicians. 91 ORG26 [ORGANIZATION] The left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing among [PERSON] army of fact-checkers, specifically on the topic of whether or not the [PERSON] is an energy-independent country, and at what point in time this may have been true or false. They also disagree on what facts should be used to define if that independence was reestablished during [LOCATION]8 term in office, and lost under the current administration. But what is certain is that the result is more censorship on ORG26 and ORG22, affecting posts by ORG39 MRC 27 times within [LOCATION]8 in [LOCATION]9. Both have labeled this content as missing context, which could therefore be misleading. 93 Five [ORGANIZATION]0 Cities Face Lawsuits Over Unmanned Voting Drop Boxes94 [ORGANIZATION]0 on [LOCATION]7 announced it has filed lawsuits on behalf of voters in [ORGANIZATION]0s five largest cities over illegal unmanned absentee voting drop boxes. [ORGANIZATION]2, [ORGANIZATION]3, GPE[ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6 face lawsuits for reportedly using the drop boxes, which are prohibited by [ORGANIZATION]0 election law. [ORGANIZATION]1 Special Counsel [LOCATION]9 said in a press release that the five cities made an agreement with the nonprofit [ORGANIZATION]2 to use the drop boxes to get these cities residents to vote. 95 Investigators Knock Down Claims PERSON30 Administration Doctored [PERSON] Numbers96 [ORGANIZATION] investigators have rejected a former health department employees claim that she was fired for refusing to doctor [PERSON] stats to benefit Gov. [PERSON]. The [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]ment of Healths [ORGANIZATION]4 found insufficient or no evidence that data scientist PERSON32 was told to manipulate or misrepresent pandemic numbers, [ORGANIZATION]5 reported. PERSON33, who ran [ORGANIZATION]s [PERSON]-19 data dashboard, received national attention after accusing superiors of fudging data to bolster PERSON30 case to ease restrictions. [ORGANIZATION] officials denied her charges from the outset. 97 PERSON34 Coming Out on Top in [STREET] of Public Opinion, Experts Say98 PERSON34 is coming out on top in the [STREET] of public opinion  and that could be even more important than whether he wins his bombshell defamation case against PERSON35, experts say. Now that the [ORGANIZATION]0 Pirates of the [LOCATION] star has told his side publicly, legal and PR professionals told [ORGANIZATION]7 a jury ruling in his favor doesnt matter as much. When PERSON34 stepped off the stand, I think he already won based on his definition of winning, said [LOCATION] civil attorney [PERSON]. Because he already obtained the favor of the [STREET] of public opinion once he told his story. 99 PERSON37 Announces Bid for Re-Election, [PERSON] in New Poll100 Rep. PERSON37 formally announced her bid for re-election [LOCATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]1 as the publication of a new poll that shows her 30 points behind her main Republican primary challenger. The survey conducted [ORGANIZATION]2 by [ORGANIZATION]8 reported that 56 of [ORGANIZATION]7 Republicans would vote for attorney PERSON38 while just 26 would back PERSON39. [ORGANIZATION]8, which has endorsed [ORGANIZATION]0, also found that 12 of voters are planning to back state Sen. [ORGANIZATION]1, while 6 are undecided. 101 Man Stabbed to Death by Door-to-Door Salesman During Fight, Authorities Say102 A [ORGANIZATION]3 [ORGANIZATION]8 man was stabbed to death [LOCATION]7 after trying to start a fight with a door-to-door salesman, authorities said. [ORGANIZATION]2, the DATE[ORGANIZATION]7 working for a company contracted by [ORGANIZATION]9 to solicit customers, has been charged with murder and two weapons offenses, [ORGANIZATION]0 said. The altercation took [STREET] shortly after the [ORGANIZATION]3 knocked on [ORGANIZATION]4 door, officials said. [ORGANIZATION]5 told [ORGANIZATION]3 he wasnt interested and the salesman left, according to the prosecutors office 103 Off-Duty Border Agent Rushed Into [PERSON]0 School With Borrowed Shotgun to Save Students104 [ORGANIZATION]6, who works as a [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION] agent and lives in [PERSON]0[LOCATION], got a chilling set of texts from his wife, a teacher at the now-famous [ORGANIZATION]. He rushed to the scene and aided in the rescue of several rooms full of children, including his own daughter, [ORGANIZATION]7. 105 Onlookers Urged Police to Charge Into [LOCATION] School106 GPE30, [LOCATION] AP  Frustrated onlookers urged police officers to charge into the [LOCATION] elementary school where a gunmans rampage killed 19 children and two teachers, witnesses said [ORGANIZATION]5, as investigators worked to track the massacre that lasted upwards of [TIME] and ended when the [ORGANIZATION]6 shooter was killed by a [ORGANIZATION]2 team. Go in there! Go in there! nearby women shouted at the officers soon after the attack began, said [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]7, who saw the scene from outside his house, across the [STREET] from [ORGANIZATION] School in the close-knit town of [PERSON]0. [ORGANIZATION]9 said the officers did not go in. PERSON50, whose fourth grade daughter, PERSON51, was killed in the attack, said he raced to the school when he heard about the shooting, arriving while police were still gathered outside the building. Upset that police were not moving in, he raised the idea of charging into the school with several other bystanders. Lets just rush in because the cops arent doing anything like they are supposed to, he said. More could have been done. They were unprepared, he added. [TIME], [ORGANIZATION]9 had watched as [PERSON] crashed his truck into a ditch outside the school, grabbed his AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle and shot at two people outside a nearby funeral home who ran away uninjured 107 Probe Finds No Link Between GPE31 School and Possible Tumor Cluster108 An investigation into a possible brain cancer cluster found no evidence a GPE31 school was the cause of tumors diagnosed in former students, officials declared [LOCATION]7. During a press conference, local and state officials said a probe into [ORGANIZATION]3, located in GPE32, found there was no cause and effect relationship between those illnesses and the building and grounds at [ORGANIZATION]3. [ORGANIZATION]8 we are very happy to announce that our extensive testing for both radon and radiation in the interior and exterior of the school building produced no evidence of cancer-causing hazards that warrant further investigation, said GPE32 Mayor [PERSON] during the press conference posted on the townships [PERSON] page. This is terrific news for the current students of [ORGANIZATION]3 and their parents, who worried about their safety, along with current staff members, and is also great news for all former students who attended and staff who worked at [ORGANIZATION]3. The investigation was jumpstarted after it was discovered more 122 people once connected to the school had a primary brain tumor and another 75 were diagnosed with other rare forms of cancer, according to [ORGANIZATION]4. 109 Prominent Journalists, [ORGANIZATION]s Fall for Hoax Claiming Gov. [PERSON] Paid [PERSON]0 Victims Families for Photo-Ops110 Left-wing activists and prominent journalists that write for liberal publications spread a hoax on [LOCATION]7 that [LOCATION] Governor Greg [PERSON] paid the families of the [PERSON]0, [LOCATION] shooting massacre victims for photo ops. The shocking false claims came from the ORG25 account [ORGANIZATION]5, which stated that following the [ORGANIZATION] School mass shooting, a representative for Governor [PERSON] showed up to his residence and attempted to coerce his family. The post has since gone viral. 111 PERSON56 [PERSON] a One World Government Its Not a Conspiracy Theory112 Senator PERSON56 appeared on [ORGANIZATION]6 [LOCATION]7 and discussed the ongoing ORG84 gathering in [ORGANIZATION], remarking that it is not a conspiracy theory to suggest the organisation is seeking a one world government, rather it is in their mission statement. PERSON57 urged that The real danger here thats even more dangerous than all their phony caring about carbon footprint, the real danger is this look how bad your government is in a country where you get to vote for these people. This would be a government, a world government where you dont get to vote on anybody. This is everybodys worst nightmare, PERSON57 asserted, referring to the penetration of the [ORGANIZATION]7, to quote its head PERSON58, into national governments. 113 Shoplifting Suspect [PERSON]ed 108 Times After Stealing From GPE34 [ORGANIZATION]8 Repeatedly114 [ORGANIZATION]9 PERSON59 has now been arrested for the 108th time for repeatedly stealing from a GPE34 [ORGANIZATION]8 store. But since the arrests are under petit larceny, [ORGANIZATION] law says such misdemeanor crimes arent eligible for monetary bail. [STREET] officials have tried placing [PERSON]0 under the care of [ORGANIZATION]9, but this alternative to jail hasnt stopped the suspect from habitual shoplifting. 115 [PERSON]1 Lied About [PERSON]2 So [ORGANIZATION] Wouldnt Dismiss [PERSON] Feds116 GPE36  Former [PERSON] [PERSON]2 campaign lawyer [PERSON] [PERSON]1 lied to an [ORGANIZATION] official because he knew the bureau would have been more skeptical of since-discredited allegations of a [PERSON]5 link to [LOCATION] had they known he was acting on behalf of the [PERSON]2 campaign and an internet executive, a federal prosecutor charged [LOCATION]. He knew he had to conceal his representation of the [PERSON]2 campaign and [PERSON]6 to push the ORG61 allegations to the [ORGANIZATION], prosecutor [PERSON]7 told jurors in his closing argument in GPE38 federal [STREET]. The chances of the [ORGANIZATION] investigating would be diminished, would be seriously less if [PERSON]1 had been up front with former [ORGANIZATION] general counsel [PERSON]8 about his clients, [PERSON]9 added. 117 Swiss Billionaire Behind Dem Dark Money Donations Despite Not Being [PERSON] Citizen118 A Swiss [ORGANIZATION]0 billionaire has donated tens of millions of dollars to Democratic politicians and progressive causes in dark money contributions  and [ORGANIZATION]0 is likely funneling millions more to influence midterm elections in [ORGANIZATION]1, sources say. One GPE39-based think tank estimates that, since [ORGANIZATION]2, nonprofits linked to ORG62 have funneled more than 253 million to Democratic candidates and related causes, such as voter registration initiatives that benefit the party and efforts to impeach former President [PERSON]5, through a dizzying array of related nonprofits. The foreign dark money revolving door is at it again, this time with their eyes set on the midterms, said [ORGANIZATION]1, executive director of the conservative [PERSON]8ns for [ORGANIZATION]. ORG62 has already funneled hundreds of millions through his nonprofits to liberal groups that influence our elections, and now those very same groups are poised to engage in every policy and political fight all the [STREET] until [ORGANIZATION]1. 119 [PERSON]0 Governor [PERSON] After He Was Misled About Police Response in [PERSON]0 Shooting120 Update [ORGANIZATION]3 [LOCATION] Governor Greg [PERSON] R said he was misled about the police response to the school shooting in [PERSON]1, and is livid about what happened. 121 Universities Reinstate Mask Mandates Around the Country122 As [ORGANIZATION]4 draws to an end, [PERSON]8n universities around the country are reinstating mask mandates. ORG64 sent out an email to its students on [ORGANIZATION]5, stating that its mask mandate will go back into effect beginning [LOCATION], [DATE] and remain in [STREET] through [ORGANIZATION]5, DATE[DATE]5. Not all students are on board with the policy change, however. We are already one of the strictest schools with [PERSON] not only do we have to be vaccinated and boosted, but we also have to be tested [ORGANIZATION]8 and fill out a symptom monitoring survey, said [ORGANIZATION]2, a freshman at the university. The ORG65 website states, effective [ORGANIZATION]5, [DATE], face masks are once again required indoors across [LOCATION], except when working alone or separated from others by 6 feet or more. Regardless of how students may feel, more universities around the nation are following suit and implementing mask mandates again. 123 Watch [PERSON]0, [ORGANIZATION] ORG67 Convention, [ORGANIZATION] Officers Disgusting Pigs1[ORGANIZATION]7 [ORGANIZATION], which returned DATE40 following a hiatus during the [PERSON] pandemic, was met with anti-gun activists swarming the conventions [PERSON]2, [LOCATION] location on [LOCATION] in response to massacre at [ORGANIZATION] School on [ORGANIZATION]. 125 [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON]3 [PERSON]4 Mass Grave Debunked by Academics126 DATE41, the leaders of the [PERSON]5 First Nation Band ORG69 te [ORGANIZATION] announced the discovery of a mass grave of more than 200 Indigenous children detected at a residential school in [PERSON]5. We had a knowing in our community that we were able to verify. To our knowledge, these missing children are undocumented deaths, [ORGANIZATION]3, chief of [ORGANIZATION], said in a statement on [PERSON]. The band called the discovery, [PERSON]6  or the missing. Whats still missing, however, according to a number of Canadian academics, is proof of the remains in the ground. Since DATE43 announcement, there have been no excavations at [PERSON]4 nor any dates set for any such work to commence. Nothing has been taken out of the ground so far, according to a ORG69 te [ORGANIZATION] spokesman. 127 Doctor Gave [PERSON]-19 Shot to Hundreds of Kids DATE44 A [PERSON]7 doctor is facing no professional discipline after admitting to giving the Covid-19 vaccine to at least 500 kids DATE45, despite the shot not being approved for children DATE46. According to the [PERSON]7 Star, Dr. [ORGANIZATION]4 from [PERSON]8 stands by his decision and claims he did it to protect children. 129 Interview [ORGANIZATION]5 on His First Feature Film, Trucker Rebellion The Battle for [PERSON]130 Over the course of the pandemic, ORG71 video journalist [ORGANIZATION]5 [ORGANIZATION] has morphed himself from a warehouse worker in [PERSON]9 to a successful GPE50 documentary filmmaker with a sold-out premiere. His first feature film, called Trucker Rebellion The Battle for [PERSON] documents his time embedded in the blockade at [DATE] main crossing with GPE51 where truckers and farmers led an uprising against remaining [PERSON] restrictions and vaccine mandates.

Police say that they responded to reports of someone carrying a rifle in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood [TIME]. The suspect was described as a man in either their DATE47 or DATE48, wearing a long jacket and a baseball hat, according to [ORGANIZATION]. 133 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] for Provincial Employees134 GPE53 has become the latest province to rescind its Covid vaccination policy for employees, including workers in long-term care homes, fire departments and many other settings. Given the current epidemiology of the province, a decision has been made not to extend the policy, read a statement by ORG74 health department on [LOCATION]7. The decision comes into effect on DATE[DATE], and will apply to those who first fell under the mandate on DATE50. 135 [ORGANIZATION]7 Says ORG75 Decision to Allow Parole Opportunity for [PERSON] Shooter Violates Sense of Justice136 Conservative leadership frontrunner [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]7 released a statement on [LOCATION] condemning the Canadian ORG75 over its decision to not allow a sentence of DATE51 for the [PERSON] mosque shooter. To[ORGANIZATION] decision by the ORG75 of [PERSON]3 to reduce the sentence of [ORGANIZATION]9, who pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted murder for his attack on Muslim worshippers at FAC8 in [PERSON] City on DATE53 violates our sense of justice, wrote [ORGANIZATION]7. 137 [PERSON] Starts Vaccine Campaign Against Monkeypox138 [PERSON] has started its vaccine campaign against monkeypox, immunizing those who have been in close contact with the disease. The provinces interim public health director, Dr. PERSON80, said that the province now has 25 confirmed cases, with 30 suspected cases under investigation. 139 ORG78 in GPE56? Likely in a City Near You as Well!140 There has been no lack of attention on ORG79 as of late, in large part thanks to the incredible work of our team of independent journalists in GPE57, which you can find at [ORGANIZATION][URL] , and [ORGANIZATION] from our very own [ORGANIZATION]5, which you can watch at [ORGANIZATION], but for many implications of the actions of ORG81 still seem far off but are they? We are far beyond the absurd narrative that concerns over the [ORGANIZATION]7 are conspiratorial, most of the alleged conspiracy theories out there are in fact direct quotes from PERSON81 himself, like his shocking admission that half of PERSON82 cabinet are [ORGANIZATION]7 young global leaders, and that his organization intentionally penetrates foreign cabinets. For all the concern over foreign interference by certain politicians, this should be at the forefront of those conversations. Despite all of this, many are still relatively unworried about the [ORGANIZATION]7s activities. They believe that the aspirations of this group are far off pipedreams for some global movers and shakers, not locally influential realities but they are wrong. Personally founded by PERSON58, ORG83 is a ORG84 initiative comprised of 500 hubs in 500 cities that bring together over 15,000 leading young adult advocates to focus on four pillars of activism which include [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. 141 PERSON83 Cancels Fancy Fundraiser Appearance Due to Protesters Wanting Freedom Back142 What was supposed to be an expensive in-person evening with the prime minister this past [ORGANIZATION] quickly turned into guests paying 1,000 each to watch [PERSON] appear virtually for [TIME] instead.

The guard responded in the affirmative, uhmm hmmm. The team of six journalists ORG71 sent to GPE57, [PERSON], to cover the DATE55 cloister of ORG81 made a [TIME] detour on the [STREET] home through [ORGANIZATION]0, to report on the 75th ORG87, an event hosted by the ORG85. However, the team was not met with open arms and a vigorous defence of press freedoms upon their arrival 145 Dutch PM Sees Hope for [ORGANIZATION]1 Agreeing to [LOCATION]n [PERSON] Although [ORGANIZATION]1 is still resisting the sixth ORG88 sanctions package against [LOCATION], Dutch Prime Minister PERSON87 has told C[ORGANIZATION]5 in an interview that an agreement between other ORG88 member states and [ORGANIZATION]1 on the proposed oil embargo could be reached by DATE56. While PERSON88 did not provide any details on how he envisioned such a compromise, the ORG90 news outlet has previously reported on the matter, citing an ORG88 diplomat who suggested that pipeline oil transport would not be affected by the embargo, only imports by sea  this was one of [ORGANIZATION]1s key requests. 147 ORG88 Urges [ORGANIZATION] Violators148 The ORG91 on [LOCATION] announced the introduction of an anonymous online platform for people to report any violations of sanctions on [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION]3. Aware of anyone violating ORG88 sanctions on [LOCATION] or [ORGANIZATION]3?

The commission also said on its website that sharing first-hand information can be a powerful tool to help uncover cases of violations, including evasion and circumvention. 1[DATE] [ORGANIZATION] Over [LOCATION]n Shutdown Fears150 Gas rationing in [LOCATION] may be coming down the pike should PERSON89 follow through on his threat to cut off supplies to those who refuse to pay [LOCATION] in rubles, the [ORGANIZATION]s energy commissioner has warned. DATE57, the ORG88 has announced that it is crafting contingency plans, including rationing gas in DATE58 in the event of a complete shut down of [LOCATION]n gas shipments to the bloc. As many have already warned, a shortage of gas could be devastating to major [LOCATION]an economies like [ORGANIZATION]4, which rely on abundant, cheap energy to function. 151 French Police [PERSON] ORG95-Supporting Teen Over Imminent Terror Attack152 French police in the department of [ORGANIZATION]5 have arrested an [ORGANIZATION]6 they claim was plotting to carry out a terrorist attack over DATE59 and pledged allegiance to the ORG96 terror group.

[ORGANIZATION]7 panels on a range of topics from climate change to the metaverse have revealed some startling and controversial projects, including an individual carbon tracker and global surveillance for viral outbreaks. The problem with ORG81 isnt that its some shadowy cabal secretly pulling the strings of world leaders, [PERSON]02 senior journalist PERSON96 said from GPE57, where hes covering the [ORGANIZATION]7s DATE55 meeting. The organization is quite open about its agenda to phase out oil and gas, recalibrate free speech, and push for social credit-style carbon emissions tracking. 165 [ORGANIZATION]7 Reports Closing Thoughts as Rebels [PERSON] GPE57166 The curtain has closed in GPE57, [PERSON], on another DATE55 meeting of ORG81.

President PERSON99 joined other senior [LOCATION] officials in denouncing suggestions that [PERSON]1 should cede territory to [LOCATION] in return for peace.

A [LOCATION] man who survived [LOCATION]n beatings and death threats recounted his ordeal. [LOCATION] said it would retrain [LOCATION] teachers in occupied regions, part of [PERSON]04 effort to establish control over the territory.

In a video posted on social networking site, ORG25, [LOCATION]00 can be seen dismissing the ongoing conflict in [PERSON]1 and warning GPE73 that it will be next. 175 [LOCATION] Squeezes [PERSON]1 in the East176 [LOCATION]n forces on [LOCATION] pounded the last [LOCATION] strongholds in a separatist-controlled eastern province of [PERSON]1, including a city where authorities said 1,500 people have been killed and 60 of residential buildings destroyed since the start of the war.

The cities are the last areas under [LOCATION] control in [LOCATION], one of two provinces that make up the region. [LOCATION]n forces have made slow but persistent advances as they bombarded and sought to encircle both GPE76 and [PERSON]. The [LOCATION]ns are pounding residential neighborhoods relentlessly, regional governor [LOCATION]02 wrote in a [PERSON]05 post [LOCATION].

PERSON20 PERSON21 is a little biased, PERSON23 said, speaking to [ORGANIZATION]7 on [PERSON]. It showed implicit bias when he said all Asians are economically sound, well, we can afford tutoring.

The problem with the internet is anonymity, according to them. Wouldnt we all be better off if we were forced to identify ourselves before using social media platforms?

Those red flag orders went into effect on [PERSON]4. [PERSON]ts take the definition of this new game directly from ORG[ORGANIZATION]2 and examine it A red flag law is a gun violence protection law that permits police or family members to petition a state [STREET] to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves. A judge makes the determination to issue the order based on statements and actions made by the gun owner in question. After a set time, the guns are returned to the person from whom they were seized unless another [STREET] hearing extends the period of confiscation. Such orders are known as [ORGANIZATION] ERPO in [PERSON]8, [PERSON]9, [PERSON]7, and [ORGANIZATION]0, as Risk Protection Orders in [PERSON] as Gun Violence Restraining Orders in GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 as risk warrants in [ORGANIZATION]2 and as Proceedings for the Seizure and Retention of a [ORGANIZATION] in GPE[ORGANIZATION]2. Returning to the incident in [PERSON]7, take a look at this excerpt from [PERSON] from [PERSON]5 Neither of the officers were injured. Their names werent released. It wasnt clear why the red flag order was issued. A spokeswoman for the [PERSON]7 Judiciary denied a request from ORG[ORGANIZATION]8 to release protection order requests associated with the home, citing the law which states the orders are confidential unless a [STREET] rules otherwise. PERSON[ORGANIZATION]2, the mans niece, told ORG[ORGANIZATION]8 that one of her aunts requested the protective order against PERSON24, but she declined to say why. [PERSON]7s law, which went into effect [PERSON]6, is more broad in that it allows certain health care providers to seek an order, in addition to family members and law enforcement. LOOK HOW THINGS WORK IN THE TOTALITARIAN HEIR TO THE SOVIET [LOCATION]0ION THAT [ORGANIZATION]4 HAS BECOME! Sounds as if its so[LOCATION]ing right out of PERSON[LOCATION], but here it is The names of the cops were not released. [ORGANIZATION] could not report on associated case actions. PERSON[ORGANIZATION]8 of the ORG28 [PERSON]7 Judiciary using a law to prevent the publics knowledge without [STREET] approval.

Everyone with the [ORGANIZATION]70 Spartans patch and the ???? ?a? or ???O? ???? written on their sleeves?  Translation Come and Take it!  Yes, they will. They are. For now, theyre attempting to do it without a fightpassing the legislation or circumventing it, rather and forcing the compliance of the citizenry. They are in the process of doing far more, and another episode really su[PERSON]arizes the key concept the Totalitarian mindset of elected officials. This piece is entitled, GPE[ORGANIZATION]6 Democrat threatens [LOCATION] if Americans dont hand over their guns. This threat is not figurative it is literal. I strongly reco[PERSON]end reading the whole article. Democratic Congressman PERSON27 D, GPE[LOCATION] is proposing that the government offer up to 1,000 for semi-automatic weapons, and a buy-back to [STREET] those firearms in the hands of the governmentfor an estimated cost of 15 billion This man should be removed from office i[PERSON]ediately, no questions askedplaced upon administrative leave and then brought to bear for his statement. The mindset is the danger this is not the exception among politicians, but the norm. In these neo-feudal times, you the citizen are expected to wear your uniform, the tan called [ORGANIZATION] fabric composition substituted for a color pants, and the red shirt of ORG29 or the [ORGANIZATION] blue shirt of ORG[ORGANIZATION]7. Wear them, and the little name tag, and give half of what you make to the governmentand allow them to craft your livesas you obey. Once again, the PERSON28 character in The [PERSON] portrayed by PERSON29 characters lines were correct An elected legislature can trample a mans rights as easily as a king. They are coming for the guns. They are marching forward with their legislation, to provide legitimacy for their actions under the color of law. Their doorkickers are ass-kickers, in good shape and sharp reflexes with good mental acumen. They are psychologically protected to allow them to act with full force without restraint protected with direct deposit of their check, protected with life insurance, and protected with healthcare for their familiesall of their basics taken care of, plus a badge theyre covered, when they come for the citizens. The last step for a full-blown tyranny before the actual collapse political, military, economic, or a combination thereof is evident in the tyrannical measures and inflictions they foster against their own populace.98 Report PERSON[ORGANIZATION]7 [PERSON] [PERSON]1 Probe of [PERSON]2 Workplace Safety99 According to the [PERSON]9 Post, [PERSON]1 will launch an extensive safety review of [PERSON]2 and [PERSON]4, assessing the culture of the two private companies tapped to fly the agencys astronauts.

Shes also the first high-profile politician that I know who spent [DATE]0 mocking her own constituents as drug-addled nincompoops, only to, in the end, receive their backing. PERSON34 record of contempt for her own people is nonpareil. The [STREET] she openly and endlessly complains about the loons in her state is akin to an elderly crank who never stops complaining about the one time the cable company once tried to upcharge him for [LOCATION]3. On multiple occasions, PERSON[ORGANIZATION]3 has referred to her home state as crazy, a [LOCATION] lab for democracy, and an accursed [STREET] no good ever emerges from. Not once, it seems, did she ever stop to think how this obloquy reflects on her an [ORGANIZATION]n, after all. One is reminded of PERSON36 classic quote By dint of railing at idiots, one runs the risk of becoming an idiot oneself. Despite her best attempts to shower voters with disdain, PERSON[ORGANIZATION]3 defeated her opponent, PERSON37, a decorated war pilot with the distinction of being the first woman to ever fly a [PERSON]5 [ORGANIZATION] combat mission.

The cast includes [ORGANIZATION]21 and [ORGANIZATION]22, who play PERSON45ian parents who coerce their DATE[ORGANIZATION]6 son into what the film calls a gay conversion therapy program. Not surprisingly, the media are promoting the film. In a brief review, the [PERSON]9 Post claimed that, by one estimate, nearly 700,000 Americans have been subjected to whats known as conversion therapy, a practice that attempts to change ones sexual orientation and  without evidence of efficacy  is still legal in 41 states. Think they have an agenda? Why not frame it In nine states, clients constitutional rights have been violated by state laws preventing them from getting the professional counseling they need to help them recover their natural sexuality. And In 14 states, parents are barred from securing licensed reparative therapy for their children. In his paper, [ORGANIZATION] SOCE Effective? Are They Harmful? What the Evidence Shows, [PERSON]30 Senior Fellow for Policy [ORGANIZATION]23 su[PERSON]arizes Critics of SOCE make two claims  that it is ineffective, and that it is harmful. Six studies or surveys from [ORGANIZATION]1 are reviewed, all of which show that SOCE can be effective for some clients in bringing about significant change in some components of sexual orientation. Few harms were reported. Older reports, including 600 studies and five meta-analyses, showed the same. One widely-cited report on harms, with a sample selected for that purpose, offered almost entirely anecdotal rather than statistical evidence. These studies make clear that the evidence for the effectiveness of SOCE far outweighs the evidence of its harm.  [ORGANIZATION], Representative [ORGANIZATION]24 Make my Day Gun control advocates are tactically referring to this proposed effort as a buyback for the same reason restauranteurs call the Patagonian toothfish a Chilean sea bass on their menus. A government buyback of guns may sound much more palatable for the American public than a forcible government confiscation of firearms, but it doesnt change the nature of the thing. The actual choice for Americans, under [ORGANIZATION]24s proposal, would be to sell their guns to the government, surrender them with no recompense, or have the government forcibly confiscate them, with offenders facing prosecution or violence at the hands of government agents. This is, of course, not a choice at all, but it presents the veneer of choice, meant to hide the constitutional rights that would be stolen from American citizens. But whats most amazing about all of this is the ease with which the confiscation of heretofore-legal firearms from millions of Americans is being proposed in open forums DATE44. It is, after all, impossibly illogical to conclude that such an action by the federal government would not be in direct violation of the Second Amendment.[ORGANIZATION]22 Its Official  [PERSON] is [PERSON] in [DATE] as [PERSON]21 Votes to Make it Optional to [ORGANIZATION] on the Birth Certificate  and Turncoat Liberal Speaker Made the Casting Vote[ORGANIZATION]23 [PERSON]20 has passed landmark transgender rights laws through the lower house which include parents having to opt in to have a babys sex recorded on birth certificates.[ORGANIZATION]24 Mentally Retarded Children Being Sterilized Under Trans Agenda[ORGANIZATION][LOCATION] Watch the most censored and banned broadcast in the world and learn about the globalist plans for you and your family before its too late [ORGANIZATION]26 breaks down the globalists [PERSON], which is meant in part to sterilize mentally ill children with hormone treatments.[ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]8 Shock Video Kids Brainwashed to Hate White People[ORGANIZATION]27 Social justice indoctrination camp Children as young as [ORGANIZATION]2 brainwashed to hate white people and identify as different genders.

baltimore,2016-08-21T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,The Baltimore Sun,affordable housing,PART 2: Working in [ORGANIZATION]: Its Downtown and Business Parks Went Up and Down With The Economy,"Baseball cap says [ORGANIZATION] Celebrates [ORGANIZATION]. Photo by [PERSON] The baseball caps handed out [ORGANIZATION] said [ORGANIZATION] Celebrates [ORGANIZATION], and on the back there was the cryptic embroidery 5K125M. It meant 5,000 homes, a [ORGANIZATION]7 of [ORGANIZATION] single family and townhouses, and 125 million in land sales. While the two companies were described as partners, the relationship was really that of buyer and seller. Using the raw land it purchased in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] sold developed lots to [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] then built houses on the lots to sell to homebuyers -- and did it quickly and cheaply. Not too many companies have these kinds of relationships, said [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] chairman, president and CEO. PERSON4 Land The relationship illustrates a key financial aspect of the entire [ORGANIZATION] project [PERSON] undeveloped farmland at low prices, improve it with streets, water, sewer, shops and amenities, and sell it for many times its original cost. [PERSON] low sell high. At the celebration, there was some gentle ribbing on both sides about the most constant source of friction in the relationship the price of land. We dont charge as much for the lots as we should, joked a [ORGANIZATION] executive. In [DATE], the first nine lots [ORGANIZATION] bought from [ORGANIZATION] cost 45,900 or 5,100 apiece. [ORGANIZATION], residential lots were going for 20 times that amount or more. This building at FAC0 parkways once was the [ORGANIZATION] head[ORGANIZATION]7s. Now it houses [LOCATION] that James [ORGANIZATION] set up to support affordable housing projects. Photo by [PERSON] Yet among the ironies of the [PERSON] event was that [ORGANIZATION], now a publicly traded company, had abandoned its attractive head[ORGANIZATION]7s in downtown [ORGANIZATION] DATE5 and hustled off to [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] home state. The departure from the planned community where the homebuilding giant grew up had disappointed [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] officials, but no one brought it up at a celebration geared toward happy recollections. By that time, the [ORGANIZATION] Co. was about done selling building lots to single-family homebuilders. Not far from the GPE2 ballroom was the last of a dozen model home parks, where [ORGANIZATION] and other builders, some of them home-grown but smaller, had displayed their wares. [ORGANIZATION] after the celebration, [ORGANIZATION] itself would disappear from downtown [ORGANIZATION] in a 12 billion sale to [ORGANIZATION], one of the biggest GPE3 real estate deals ever recorded. The two companies that created [ORGANIZATION] were among the dozens of companies that have come and gone over [PERSON]. But unlike the tech companies that have merged or evaporated, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] left behind permanent structures in which people live and work, like the DATE8 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] model in which this essay is being written. During their time, the two publicly traded companies were a visible corporate presence in [ORGANIZATION], with executives and their spouses serving on nonprofit and community boards. The companies were generous financial supporters of community causes. [PERSON] and [PERSON] While Jim [ORGANIZATION] preached his grand social vision of a garden for growing people, those people needed shelter and jobs, shops and services -- and the businesses that provided them. Those homes and workplaces were essential to the economic model that would make [ORGANIZATION] a viable enterprise. As noted in DATE9 essay1, before [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] was largely a farming community with minimal employment outside of agriculture and retail. The smattering of residents in suburban developments mostly commuted into [PERSON], still a city of 900,000 people, 50 larger than it is [LOCATION]0. There were only two major employment centers in the county -- [ORGANIZATION], a center for defense work where, much like [LOCATION]0, few people knew what they did and the [ORGANIZATION] corridor. [LOCATION]1, and still [LOCATION]0, ORG9 is the largest private employer in [ORGANIZATION], now with 5,000 employees, working mostly on federal research projects. Until FAC2 between the GPE5 and [PERSON] beltways was fully completed in [LOCATION]2, [ORGANIZATION] was the major north-south route on [ORGANIZATION], and already looking seedy. Warehouses, junkyards and industrial operations were concentrated there, and just east were the freight railroad tracks that serve as the border between [ORGANIZATION] and the neighboring GPE7, from which it was lopped off in [LOCATION]3. Aside from [ORGANIZATION] shopping centers -- more on those [LOCATION]4 -- the principal employment centers were to be in downtown [ORGANIZATION] and east of [PERSON], ringing the edges of the new towns residential growth. With few people living there and the highways unfinished, [ORGANIZATION] itself built the first office buildings on the farmland that became downtown. It built a hotel there as well, before there was a market to support one, the low-slung ORG10. The hotel later added the current tower, becoming the [ORGANIZATION] Inn, and then in [LOCATION]5, [ORGANIZATION] finally unloaded the property to become the ORG12 it still is [LOCATION]0. The company slowly added seven more office buildings over [LOCATION]6, but it saved the choicest spots until the population rose and increased the value of the land. [PERSON] For the east side of [ORGANIZATION], the company followed the pattern of developing business sites for others to build on. The first business to build there was ORG13, which at the time did environmental studies, later branching into medical and nuclear equipment. PERSON8 chose [ORGANIZATION] because of its central location and because of a promised lifestyle that would make it easy to recruit highly educated workers. It was more of a dream [STREET] at that time, PERSON9 told the [PERSON] Sun in a [LOCATION]7 interview. But the promise for me was that this was a [STREET] that would attract and hold scientists and engineers. PERSON9 would become the first chair of the new [ORGANIZATION] ORG15. It was a refrain that would echo through the [LOCATION]6 from firms large and small about the decision to locate in [ORGANIZATION]. The first reason related to the time-honored real estate mantra of location, location, location, the central location that led [ORGANIZATION] to scarf up 14,000 acres of farmland. The second reason was the educated workforce, including a concentration of scientists and engineers. For [LOCATION]6, [ORGANIZATION] had more cachet than [ORGANIZATION] as a business address, said [PERSON]0, the countys economic development director from [LOCATION]9. He recounted the tale of a developer who wanted his new office buildings to have a [ORGANIZATION] address, despite its GPE8 zip code. Go ahead and call it [ORGANIZATION] anyway, [PERSON]1 told him. A postal inspector told them to knock it off. ORG16 Then Out This aerial photo shows the existing water tower and [PERSON] on the left, FAC5 on the upper right, [ORGANIZATION] intersection with [ORGANIZATION] at the bottom, and ORG17 buildings in the middle. Photo for [ORGANIZATION] by [PERSON]2 [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] Archives. PERSON9s modest industrial building was small potatoes compared to the major sale for the biggest parcel on the east side of [ORGANIZATION] to one of the worlds largest corporations, [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] sold 1,125 acres south of [ORGANIZATION]75 between [PERSON] and FAC5 for what was to become [ORGANIZATION]. It was projected to employ more than 10,000 people, manufacturing and distributing appliances, similar to an existing appliance park in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]0. Imagine how different the [ORGANIZATION] economy would be [LOCATION]0 if manufacturing had been its core industry. Ultimately, ORG21 only built four mammoth buildings on a third of the site, and employment topped at 2,800 in [DATE]0, when the company closed the air conditioner plant. [DATE]1, it shuttered the microwave oven plant as it began importing machines from [ORGANIZATION]1 and [ORGANIZATION]2. It finally shut the range plant in [DATE]2 as it acquired a more productive [ORGANIZATION]3 facility. The saga illustrates the vagaries of the economy and the fluctuating dynamics of individual industries that were constantly challenging the profitability of the [ORGANIZATION] project. From the time [ORGANIZATION] started acquiring land in [DATE]3, there have been seven national recessions. The most devastating for [ORGANIZATION]s [ORGANIZATION] project was the DATE8-75 downturn that combined the Arab oil embargo, high inflation and high unemployment. Land sales plummeted and [ORGANIZATION] Research and Development [ORGANIZATION] -- the [ORGANIZATION] Co. division that was building [ORGANIZATION] -- would have gone bankrupt except for an infusion of cash from ORG25, original financier of [ORGANIZATION]s entire [ORGANIZATION] project. [ORGANIZATION] bought back the two-thirds of the land that ORG21 never used, and later, as ORG21 pulled out, some of those buildings, as well. In the long run, while the 10,000 well-paid ORG21 manufacturing and office workers never materialized, [ORGANIZATION] used the land to create [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0, which eventually would include one of the largest concentrations of high tech businesses in the [PERSON]-GPE5 corridor. By [DATE]5, [ORGANIZATION]0 would become a hot location, but it was a long time coming, [DATE]6 after ORG21s initial deal. [ORGANIZATION] As difficult as the [DATE]7 recession had been for [ORGANIZATION]s project, the [DATE]2s recession was more severe for the [ORGANIZATION]4 economy because of the cutbacks in defense spending from the collapse of [ORGANIZATION]5 ending the Cold War. As the commercial real estate market struggled to overcome this, as well as digest speculative overbuilding from [DATE]9, [ORGANIZATION] sold only one measly acre of land in [ORGANIZATION]0 -- for a parking lot. I aggressively sat by the phone, waiting for it to ring, recalled [PERSON]3, [ORGANIZATION] vice president for business land sales. The situation in [ORGANIZATION]0 was so dire that an empty glass-and-marble five-story office building was sold to the county government at a fire-sale price, becoming head[ORGANIZATION]7s for several agencies, including the newly privatized [ORGANIZATION]0. Then along came [ORGANIZATION]1. The fast-growing company, founded by a graduate of [ORGANIZATION] High School, supplied hardware and software to restaurants and hotels worldwide. Its 700 employees were scattered among several buildings in [ORGANIZATION]6. A few top executives already lived in [ORGANIZATION], and we felt relocating there could help our technical recruiting efforts, its chief financial officer told me. In [DATE]5, it put up the first [ORGANIZATION]0 office building visible from FAC5. For a brief time from [DATE]5 to [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]0 and other [ORGANIZATION] locations were the epicenter of an explosion of fiber optics research, with [ORGANIZATION]3 the biggest player, employing 1,500 people at one point and raising 1 billion in its initial stock offering. Companies large and small were trying to capture a share of the photonics revolution, boosting communications and Internet speeds through fiber optic cables. The movement was so large that we at [ORGANIZATION]4 produced a special section for a national engineering conference in [PERSON] on fiber optics in [PERSON], featuring all two-dozen [ORGANIZATION]4 companies. Those that survived the end of the boomlet transformed themselves by merger or acquisition. Some simply went out of business. The [ORGANIZATION]1 sign that graced its building for [ORGANIZATION]1 has been replaced by its new owner, [ORGANIZATION]5, repeating the continual pattern where large high tech firms eat small tech firms. There are few large head[ORGANIZATION]7s of home-grown businesses anymore. [ORGANIZATION]6, the hospital conglomerate that has agreed to occupy the newest downtown [ORGANIZATION] structure going up at FAC0, is an exception. Not only is the [ORGANIZATION]1 sign gone, so is [ORGANIZATION]7, the once-thousand-strong audience monitoring firm for radio stations on [ORGANIZATION]2 Parkway at [ORGANIZATION]4. It was purchased by [ORGANIZATION]8, which now has a smaller presence here. The [ORGANIZATION]9 building on Little [ORGANIZATION]1 Parkway across from the community college, once the head[ORGANIZATION]7s for a 13-paper chain of community newspapers, has stood vacant for [ORGANIZATION]2 and is slated for affordable housing. Long-time community leaders note the loss in corporate presence here. The business community used to be very much involved in social issues here ... as corporate citizens, observed [PERSON]4, president of the [ORGANIZATION] Association for 26 [ORGANIZATION]2. Now, there are a lot of corporate addresses and absentee ownership, noted [PERSON]5, head of [LOCATION]1, an advertising and marketing firm. Not Like [ORGANIZATION] Whats even odder about this long run-down of the business underpinnings of [ORGANIZATION] and its role as a key employment center for the region is that [ORGANIZATION]0 may officially be part of [ORGANIZATION], but by look and feel it and the other local business parks could be anywhere. Their landlords and tenants generate millions for the [ORGANIZATION] Association lien, but theres little sense that they are part of [ORGANIZATION] at all. The majority of employees in [ORGANIZATION]0, or any [ORGANIZATION] business park, do not live in [ORGANIZATION], much as the majority of [ORGANIZATION] residents do not work in the new town, as was the case from [ORGANIZATION]3. Only one out of five working [ORGANIZATION] residents has commuting times of [TIME] or less, and close to half 45 have commuting times of [TIME] or more. Living and working here, as I have been able to do for half my career, might have been the ideal, but it has never been true for the vast majority of residents. lives in [ORGANIZATION]0, except for one long-term-stay hotel. There is no mixed use, and but a puny strip of retail. Larger office buildings have their own cafeterias, or at least delis. Even with 12,000 or more people working there, pedestrian traffic is nil. Even [ORGANIZATION]0s [STREET] names have none of the striking weirdness of [ORGANIZATION] residential cul-de-sacs, drawn from American literature. Instead, they are named for American inventors and scientists [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8, [PERSON]9, [ORGANIZATION]0. On [ORGANIZATION]4, the surface parking lots that encircle the buildings are empty. There is still prime acreage for sale in [ORGANIZATION]0, and while the focus of [ORGANIZATION] development has shifted to downtown, former [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]1, who guided the renewed plan for the center of [ORGANIZATION], said, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 has got to adapt as well. [ORGANIZATION]2, who succeeded [PERSON]0 as [ORGANIZATION]3 economic development director and later become GPE7 executive, agreed that [ORGANIZATION]0 needs a mixed use development. People like to live where they work, [ORGANIZATION]4 said, recalling her experience as a top executive of [LOCATION]3 on [ORGANIZATION]7 in [ORGANIZATION] west of [ORGANIZATION]0, where there was a bar in the building, a deli, a dry cleaner, and hotels and restaurants that the staff used nearby. A Familiar Setting The former [ORGANIZATION] Co. head[ORGANIZATION]7s now a grocery store, with a health space on the lowest level. Photo by [PERSON] The room on the top of the old [ORGANIZATION] Co. head[ORGANIZATION]7s was as familiar to me as any in [ORGANIZATION]. The modern chandeliers with parallel panes of glass are gone, the air ducts exposed and the floor bare, but the balconies still overlook LOC2. I have this visual memory of a late [DATE]7 [ORGANIZATION]9 meeting of the [ORGANIZATION] Co. there, with top executives sitting at an elevated table, getting ready to start the meeting. One called out to me, a lowly business reporter for a [ORGANIZATION]6 community paper, about a news brief that had run with the headline [ORGANIZATION] has bad [ORGANIZATION]7. Heck, it was just a rewrite of a press release, and maybe the headline did overblow the financial results, but whats the big deal? The big deal that I didnt realize till then was that in [ORGANIZATION]8 before the Internet put everything online, stock analysts would subscribe to dinky local publications where public companies operated, looking for clues and problems the companies would not freely disclose. The space once called [ORGANIZATION]8, and later [ORGANIZATION]9, was long the scene of the [ORGANIZATION]9 party of The [ORGANIZATION] Foundation, where you were likely to see all the movers and shakers in town. It was the site of memorial services as well. This was also where [LOCATION]5, the [ORGANIZATION] Co. successor, had unveiled some of the first illustrations of how [ORGANIZATION] downtown might look. Afterward, [PERSON]4 and I would briefly discuss my book idea, he suggesting I should write about [ORGANIZATION] as a lived experience, as I am doing in these installments. In this room [PERSON]0, I sat among mostly old friends and acquaintances to get an update on the downtown plans that may, at long last, 36 [ORGANIZATION]2 after the original target date for completion, accomplish the goal of [ORGANIZATION] downtown as a complete city, not just a better suburb, as Jim [ORGANIZATION] had said. Other people had their own memories of the room, now an unoccupied floor over the [LOCATION]6 grocery. This is where I had my prom, said [ORGANIZATION] Executive [ORGANIZATION]5, who graduated from nearby [LOCATION]7 as [ORGANIZATION] was being built in the [DATE]7. The [PERSON]3 event was ostensibly to provide an update on the progress of the downtown plan to put the final touches on the remaining 391 acres of town center, already 10 [ORGANIZATION]2 in the works and six [ORGANIZATION]2 since its formal passage. [PERSON]6, [ORGANIZATION]6 introduced legislation moving forward the final elements of the plan. [ORGANIZATION] is not inevitable, he told an audience of about 150 invited guests, all previously involved in the planning. We need to jump start the plan. ... We need to make sure this happens before were all 95 [ORGANIZATION]2 old. Health will occupy this new building being completed at [ORGANIZATION]. Photo by [PERSON] The key is to make the new [ORGANIZATION] core into a [STREET] to live, work and play, built around the towns first public structure, a revived FAC21, [ORGANIZATION]6 said. [ORGANIZATION] Hughes Corp., [LOCATION]9 spin-off, is calling this area [PERSON]. It combines apartments, retail, offices and public institutions in a walkable mix with a decidedly urban feel. Plans call for 6,400 residential units -- up 900 from the [PERSON]8 plan -- 4.3 million square feet of office space, 1.25 million square feet of retail and a 640-room hotel. Building a [PERSON]9 city is one of the reasons I moved here from [PERSON] County, said [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] Chair [ORGANIZATION]7. Revitalization is the right word for what were doing here, and the enhanced center of culture and commerce already in the works is exactly what we need. His council colleague [ORGANIZATION]8, whose West [ORGANIZATION] district includes downtown, told the audience, If [ORGANIZATION] is only a great [STREET] to raise a family, what are we missing? How are we bringing young people into the community? Having lived here 44 [ORGANIZATION]2, I continue to wait for the promise to happen, [ORGANIZATION]9 said. The cocktail hour reception was really a pep rally for the final implementation of the downtown plan. A key element, long planned but not much publicized, is a proposed 93 million tax increment financing, dubbed a [ORGANIZATION]. It authorizes the county to float bonds based on the tax proceeds from future development to pay for infrastructure, in this case a 2,500-space parking garage designed to service FAC22 in the evenings and DATE51, and office buildings during DATE52. When the county council began holding extended hearings on the proposals DATE53, it became clear why supporters of the plan needed to be rallied. Speaker after speaker in two [TIME] sessions decried the plans. Key sticking points are the [ORGANIZATION] -- many called it a handout to the developer, a free ride -- and [TIME] Member [ORGANIZATION]0 push to increase the amount of affordable housing from 10 to 15. That increase was favored even by some of those backing other elements of the plan. Too Dense, Too High, Too Many The densest part of the new development called [PERSON]. Illustration by [ORGANIZATION] Hughes Corp. Over and over, the council heard people say there were too many apartments, they would overload the schools, the hospital, the roads traffic would be terrible, like the mall at DATE54 but [PERSON]. The proposed buildings were too high most of the residences are seven stories and the few tall office buildings are 14 stories. There would be too many people and too much density -- though the amount of [ORGANIZATION] and trees shown on site maps and renderings is more than downtown [ORGANIZATION]8 or [ORGANIZATION]9. [ORGANIZATION]1 had moved her family to [ORGANIZATION] for the schools and pathways. Im very concerned with the urbanization. ... The density of this plan seems to have no limit. We wanted the suburban lifestyle. If we wanted a city, we had plenty of other choices, [ORGANIZATION]2 said. That sort thinking runs counter to most of those who developed the downtown plan, like [ORGANIZATION]1, who devoted immense time and energy as county executive to enacting it. People want to live in cities, urban centers that are walk-able and bike-able, said [ORGANIZATION]3, now an economic development consultant. You want the right mix. Whats the scale whats the mix? How tall should a building be? [ORGANIZATION]3 faced opposition all along the [STREET]. I dont begrudge peoples anxieties about change, [ORGANIZATION]3 said. But things change while youre fighting change. Weve had a great 50 [ORGANIZATION]2 in [ORGANIZATION], said [ORGANIZATION]3, DATE57, born and raised in [ORGANIZATION] and now raising his own family here.

An ORG6 spokesperson confirmed that no employees were hurt at the shooting, according to ORG7.

In a telephone briefing with reporters on [LOCATION]1, PERSON9, the [PERSON] ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, cited efforts in [PERSON]5, where a partnership that includes the [PERSON] Agency for International Development has begun to assist the redevelopment and repopulating of northern [PERSON]5 by [PERSON] and Christians that had been run out during ISIS.55 Democratic Governor [PERSON] for Leftist Who Firebombed ORG6 Facility56 The Democratic Governor of [PERSON]2 believes there is one person to blame for an incident in which a far-left activist tried to firebomb an ORG6 facility President [PERSON].

The results validate the concerns of many Democrats that the party is moving too far left and losing moderate voters in the process.61 [PERSON]7 [ORGANIZATION]3 Manufactured the Case Against General [PERSON]8 The newest piece of information comes courtesy of [ORGANIZATION]4 in his piece, [PERSON]9 Case Highlights Multiple Insurance Policy Motives by [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6 Operatives. Up to this point, I confess, I bought into the story that [PERSON] [PERSON]9 was working on behalf of [PERSON]7 and failed to register under the Foreign Agent Registration Act. In short, he was guilty of a FARA violation. But thats not the real story. [PERSON]9 was set up. What do I mean? There is no evidence that [PERSON] [PERSON]9 sought out Government of [PERSON]7 representative and asked to go to work for them. That has been the conventional wisdom. But it turns out that [PERSON]9 was not working for the Government of [PERSON]7. [PERSON]9s firm was hired by [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]4. Here is what ORG21 reported in [LOCATION]5 As part of its contract with ORG22, the [PERSON]9 [ORGANIZATION] hired researchers to examine [PERSON]1, a reclusive Islamic cleric who lives in exile in rural [PERSON]8. [PERSON]2 has blamed [PERSON]3 opposition group for an attempted [LOCATION]6 coup and has sought his extradition. On [LOCATION]7, [PERSON] newspaper published a [PERSON]9 op-ed that called [PERSON]4 radical cleric and said the [PERSON] government should not provide him a safe haven. At least three possibilities exist with respect to the motive for producing this report-1 it was initiated by the Government of [PERSON]7 using [ORGANIZATION] as a cut out, or 2 [ORGANIZATION] was asked by someone linked to the [PERSON]5 Campaign or ORG25 to hire [PERSON]9s company to do the work, or 3 [ORGANIZATION] did this on its own. Regardless of the motive, what we now know is that ORG25, courtesy of either an [ORGANIZATION]6 FISA or the ORG26, was monitoring communications with [PERSON] [PERSON]9. The [ORGANIZATION]6 Director of ORG27, [PERSON]6, led the charge in pressing [PERSON]9 to file a belated FARA. That filing was then used as evidence that [PERSON]9 lied.63 Meet the Madam [PERSON]7 [PERSON] Spotlight on [PERSON]5-Linked Socialite64 Questions swirl around role of [PERSON]8 in [PERSON]7s trafficking crimes Following the arrest of pedophile financier [PERSON] [PERSON]7 last [ORGANIZATION], many outlets have turned their attention to his longtime confiante, socialite heiress [PERSON]8  who has been accused by three women of procuring and training young girls to perform massage and sexual acts on the [LOCATION]9 registered sex offender and his associates. [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]0, comes from money. Her father was publisher Robert [ORGANIZATION]1  who himself faced accusations of being a ORG28 double and possibly triple agent and a bad character who was almost certainly financed by [PERSON]9, according to [LOCATION]. Robert [ORGANIZATION]1 died in [ORGANIZATION]1 when he fell from his yacht, the [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]3  however the circumstances surrounding his demise have been rife with speculation including that it was a ORG28 assassination  a theory which attorney and longtime [PERSON]7 associate [ORGANIZATION]4 slammed in a [ORGANIZATION]2 op-ed. It is unknown exactly how [PERSON]7 and [PERSON]8 met  however they reportedly dated [ORGANIZATION]3, shortly after her fathers death. After breaking up, they remained good friends. In [ORGANIZATION]4, [PERSON]7 renamed a now-defunct GPE20 company [ORGANIZATION]3 Corp, which was dissolved in [ORGANIZATION]5 per [PERSON]1. In [ORGANIZATION]2, [PERSON]7 described [ORGANIZATION]1 as his best friend, who was not on his payroll  yet seems to organize much of his life.65 Pushing Back Against Anti-[PERSON]nism66 For [DATE], Republicans and Christians have passively allowed leftists to infect our youth with anti-[PERSON]nism and instill a culture of glorified debauchery while systemically secularizing our government. All references of [PERSON]s Christian founding have been removed from public education. Historian [ORGANIZATION]5 is pushing back by publishing his [ORGANIZATION]. Democrats sought to destroy [ORGANIZATION]6, co-founder of [PERSON]2, for donating to [PERSON]s reelection campaign. Unlike most Republicans, [PERSON] pushed back. He boldly defended [ORGANIZATION]8 and [PERSON]2 with the following tweet67 Sexual Predators Within [PERSON]s Power Elite What Youre Not Being Told68 Politics, religion, sports, government, entertainment, business, armed forces it doesnt matter what arena youre talking about, they are all riddled with the kind of seedy, sleazy, decadent, dodgy, depraved, immoral, corrupt behavior that somehow gets a free pass when it involves the wealthy and powerful elite in [PERSON]. In this age of partisan politics and a deeply polarized populace, corruption  especially when it involves sexual debauchery, depravity and predatory behavior  has become the great equalizer. Take [PERSON] [PERSON]7, the hedge fund billionaire  convicted serial pedophile recently arrested on charges of molesting, raping and sex trafficking dozens of young girls. It is believed that [PERSON]7 operated his own personal sex trafficking ring not only for his personal pleasure but also for the pleasure of his friends and business associates. According to [PERSON]3, several of the young women.say they were offered to the rich and famous as sex partners at [PERSON]7s parties. At various times, [PERSON]7 ferried his friends about on his private plane, nicknamed [ORGANIZATION]. This is part of [PERSON]s seedy underbelly. As I documented in the in-depth piece I wrote [ORGANIZATION]7, child sex trafficking  the buying and selling of women, young girls and boys for sex, some as young as 9 DATE34 old  has become big business in [PERSON]. It is the fastest growing business in organized crime and the second most-lucrative commodity traded illegally after drugs and guns.69 Stunning Video Maps Out All of the 4,000 [ORGANIZATION] by [PERSON]4 Since [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]8 [PERSON]4 has released a stunning visualisation of all the exoplanets it has ever spotted, including those from dedicated world-hunting crafts [LOCATION] and TE[ORGANIZATION].

And the elite trembles. [PERSON]7 had already been condemned on similar charges in the past but had got off with a light sentence thanks to a plea deal brokered by former [LOCATION] attorney and current [PERSON]6 Secretary [ORGANIZATION]ander [PERSON]2. [PERSON]2 is now being highly criticized for the decision and is facing calls to resign. Besides [PERSON]2, [PERSON] is also being accused of entertaining relations with [PERSON]7 whom he praised in a declaration DATE32 [PERSON]7 [PERSON]9 Account Aimed at Supporting [PERSON]3 Suspended Without Explanation76 [PERSON]7, of the biggest [PERSON]9 accounts aimed specifically at supporting [PERSON]8 founder [PERSON]3, has been suspended from [PERSON]9 without any explanation.

Now the German defense minister needs to win over a majority of ORG40 to secure the presidency of [ORGANIZATION]. She remains an enigma to many, but is hoping some high-profile advisers can help change that. By [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7 and [PERSON]8 [PERSON]5, who is currently being shielded from journalists like a pop star from groupies, is taking a break in front of F[ORGANIZATION]1 in [PERSON] [LOCATION]an Quarter. She repeatedly throws her arms around. Now I need a bit of movement, she says. It is [TIME] on DATE33, and the aspiring president of [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] executive, is on her [STREET] to her hotel after [TIME] at her desk and phone. It is cold this late in the evening, and the center-right Christian Democrat [LOCATION] politician is wearing only a pink cardigan. But the cold doesnt seem to bother her. [PERSON]9 is bursting with energy, and gushes about her new job The young people working for the transition team, the languages, the international surroundings. After her DATE34 at the head of the stiff and scandal-plagued ORG44 in GPE25, [PERSON]0 seems like she has been liberated. In her steep political ascent, she was often protected by people at the very top, but now she has to fight for herself, and conduct a campaign on her own  or almost alone, given the small, occasionally colorful flock of advisers at her side79 [PERSON] Warning [ORGANIZATION]0s [PERSON] is Just Dress Rehearsal for Vulnerable GPE26  Expert80 THE [ORGANIZATION]0ROPEAN [LOCATION] has shot itself in the foot with its attempts to strong-arm GPE27 into signing up for a wide-ranging agreement covering financial services  but [PERSON] is likely to try a similar strategy when it comes to GPE28 as [PERSON] looms, a senior economist has predicted.81 GPE29 [PERSON]0 Has First Fireworks Show Since [LOCATION]6 Terror Attack82 The first firework display in [PERSON]0 since the terrorist attack of [DATE] [LOCATION]6 has taken [STREET] in celebration of DATE36 ORG45.

[PERSON]1 is the 75th anniversary of the failed assassination attempt on the Nazi dictator. German Chancellor [PERSON] [PERSON]1 on [ORGANIZATION] urged strong opposition from all sections of German society against the resurgence of right-wing extremism. In her [LOCATION] video address, [PERSON]2 before the 75th anniversary of the assassination attempt on Nazi dictator [PERSON] [PERSON]2, she paid tribute to those who opposed the [PERSON]5 rule, and took action. They followed their conscience and thereby shaped a part of [PERSON]1s history that otherwise would have been solely defined by the darkness of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]1 said. 85 New Syphilis Cases Now Outnumber HIV Across [LOCATION]86 A new report from ORG47 has shown a dramatic increase in new cases of [LOCATION] across [LOCATION], outnumbering new cases of HIV.

The [ORGANIZATION]1 data, published on [PERSON]6, predicts that the population of the [ORGANIZATION]0 as a whole will decline rapidly after peaking at 525 million in [PERSON]7, falling to 492.9 million by [PERSON]8. If correct, it means the Polish population has already peaked at 38 million and will steadily decline to 27.5 million in [PERSON]9 losing over a quarter of its population.89 Publish [PERSON]6 Name on [ORGANIZATION]2 and Youre Out in [PERSON]390 Since [PERSON]7 was convicted for defying [STREET] order, [ORGANIZATION]2 introduced a ban about [PERSON]8  all sharings of links regarding the dangerous person, would result in closed accounts. In [PERSON]3, it is enough to write his name on the social media platform to become banned for as long as up to DATE50. One who published a [ORGANIZATION]2 note about [PERSON]7, was journalist [PERSON]9, editor for the podcast Ingrid and [PERSON]. PERSON60 wrote that she unfortunately did not believe that Donald [PERSON] would grant asylum for [PERSON]8, due to the close [LOCATION]-GPE26 relations.91 GPE26 Khans [PERSON]4 Charges Green Tax on President [PERSON]s Diplomatic Vehicle92 Transport for [PERSON]4 [ORGANIZATION]5 has imposed 34.50 in green taxes on a vehicle that was part of President Donald [PERSON]s motorcade during his [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON]5 in DATE51.

According to sources, some of the suspects  all [PERSON]8ians  worked for a charity organization in [PERSON]7. The sources added that investigators want to know whether the cell had planned any operations outside [PERSON]7 while they were here. The sources said after confiscating the groups laptops, mobile phones and documents, state security detectives are currently examining and analyzing them to prepare a complete case file. The sources said the terrorist group had been tracked down after state security received tips from local and foreign sources, including suspects arrested in [PERSON]8, concerning the cell members and the danger they pose due to their military training. A statement by the interior ministry on [LOCATION]2 carried by the state-run news agency [ORGANIZATION]8 said the militants were allegedly members of a terrorist cell, including some who have been convicted of terrorism and sentenced to jail in [PERSON]8. Those arrested carry [PERSON]8ian nationalities and belong to the [ORGANIZATION]7 organization, the ministry said.

DATE54 [PERSON]8 outlawed the [ORGANIZATION]7 and declared it a terrorist organization. [PERSON]8 and its allies, including LOC2 powerhouses [PERSON]9 and GPE40, consider the [ORGANIZATION]7 a terrorist organization.95 ORG61 Monk and Devotees Attacked in F[ORGANIZATION]5 in GPE41 Station by [PERSON] as Provoked by Two [ORGANIZATION], While Returning From [PERSON]96 Hindu Monk and Devotees of ORG61 are badly assaulted by [PERSON] in GPE41 under provocation of [ORGANIZATION] and their husbands in [ORGANIZATION] service. No action taken so far. PERSON64  Haridwar  [LOCATION], [PERSON] This is very embarrassing that a ORG61 Monk and devotees were attacked, assaulted and humiliated in F[ORGANIZATION]5 in GPE41 Station by [PERSON] as provoked by two Muslim women, while returning from [PERSON]. But, there is no time for the [LOCATION] Railway Minister, [ORGANIZATION] Minister and GPE42 Chief Minister, anyway. ORG61 is a internationally famed philanthropic organization which is mostly renowned for its relief work in any calamity or disaster with various social welfare activities as run by the organisation. A Hindu monk who is in charge of the GPE43 branch of the ORG61 in [LOCATION] and nine other devotees returning from the [PERSON] yatra, including three women, were allegedly beaten up by a group of ORG64 personnel at GPE41 station on DATE56 past DATE57 midnight. PERSON65 popularly known as PERSON66 and some of the devotees lodged a complaint with ORG65 in GPE45 on DATE57 and have also tweeted to [LOCATION] railway minister [PERSON] and GPE46 chief minister PERSON68 about the incident. But, any reaction, intervention or appropriate steps yet to be reported unfortunately. We boarded the GPE45-bound [ORGANIZATION] from GPE47 on [TIME] and all of us had reservations in an [ORGANIZATION] coach. Two Muslim women named PERSON69 and [ORGANIZATION]0 in reserved seat no 26 and 28 in no coach no 13 with another two Muslim women requested us to let them sit in our berths. We agreed, PERSON65 said. According to the monk, at [TIME], they asked the women to sit in their reserved seats, as some elderly persons with the monk extremely needed some rests. Surprisingly, their behaviour changed all on a sudden and they refused to vacate the berths. They also threatened us that we would be taught a lesson when the train reached GPE41. One of them claimed that her husband was a senior government official in [ORGANIZATION]n [ORGANIZATION] IRPS. We did not get into any further argument and accommodated ourselves in the remaining berths, said PERSON659798 Terrified ORG68 Hi-Fi Workers Detail How Teenage Gangs Are Targeting Their Stores in Swarming Rip and Run Theft Rampages99 Thieves have increasingly swarmed stores across GPE48 taking costly items in a rip and run manner, with [ORGANIZATION] as the hottest commodity.100 GPE49 Mayor Were Not Going to Cooperate in ORG6 Raids101 GPE49s mayor announced [LOCATION]2 that his city would not be the one to cooperate in a series of targeted immigration enforcement raids taking [STREET] on [ORGANIZATION].

Governor [PERSON]1 was responding to the attack, during which [PERSON], who was armed with a rifle, was shot dead after throwing Molotov cocktails at the building and nearby cars. [PERSON]2 was an [ORGANIZATION]0 activist and reportedly wrote a manifesto explaining the motives behind the attack. However, according to presidential candidate [PERSON]3, President [PERSON] is to blame. [PERSON]3 said [PERSON] was intentionally trying to create anxiety and fear among undocumented families. He also tried to deliberately mislead people about the nature of the attack by claiming it is unknown whether [PERSON]2 was targeting detainees or staff, when it was established almost immediately that the incident was an anti-ORG6 attack. Comment Typical communist  full of lies. More and more it seems Democrats are the party of the Anti-Christ. 104 [ORGANIZATION]0 Should Charter Migrant Flights, Says Italian FM105 ORG71 foreign minister has called for recent problems posed by mass migration to be solved within a [LOCATION]an framework.

If you ask anybody walking on the side of the [STREET] somewhere in the middle of the world they will tell you, [PERSON] the great, but we dont live those values here. That hypocrisy is one that I am bothered by. I want [PERSON] the great to be [PERSON] the great. Of course, there was no question asking what she means by hypocrisy.

[ORGANIZATION] a living fire alarm of the danger of welcoming immigrants who hate [PERSON]. It was certainly a hot take, and it underlined once again that the liberal elites  the ones who claim to love democracy and free speech  will not tolerate criticism of PERSON81 PERSON90 responded in kind on DATE56 PERSON92 Needless to say, the Left went berserk[ORGANIZATION] and her allies in [ORGANIZATION]0 immediately demanded that this show be pulled off the air. They didnt rebut what we said, any of our points or even acknowledge them. They just tried to silence us. Thats how they operate. And of course they called us racist. On one level thats amusing given how absurd the charge is. This show more than any other show on television has taken an aggressive position in favor of colorblind equality and against racism, particularly the casual racism of the modern world left. We despise the current habit of judging people on the basis of their skin color. Its wrong. We say that virtually [TIME]. Racist? No. Were against racism, adamantly. PERSON81 consistently puts her own race at the center of the conversation, but to us, its irrelevant. PERSON93, for example, would by the standards of identity politics by PERSON81s standards seem to have everything in common with [ORGANIZATION]. Like PERSON81 she was born in [PERSON], moved to [LOCATION] and eventually came to this country. Unlike PERSON81, PERSON95 loves and cares about [PERSON]. She believes our country is superior to the country she came from and she says that. For saying that, the left despises her. PERSON81s friend PERSON96 once tweeted that PERSON95 deserves to be mutilated for her beliefs. So two Somali immigrants, one among the most impressive people in [PERSON], the other among the least, its not about race. But of course PERSON81 and her friends already know that. Nothing they say on the subject race is sincere. Its all a hustle designed to get them what they want. PERSON81 has made a career of denouncing anyone and anything in her [STREET] as racist. That would include virtually all of her political and personal opponents. It includes even inanimate objects like the proposed border wall, thats racist. So is [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]0, so is the entire state of GPE72, she once tweeted.124 [ORGANIZATION] Brainwashing by fake news, universities and establishment culture leads to this [PERSON] reporter PERSON97 interviews leftists protesting upcoming ORG6 deportation raids set to begin [ORGANIZATION], and tries to make sense of their twisted logic that stems from fake news and emotion-driven narratives. Can you imagine thinking this [STREET]?126 Liberal [ORGANIZATION]1 Rules for [PERSON]s Effort to Defund [ORGANIZATION]2 The [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]1 [STREET] of Appeals, typically liberal-leaning in its rulings, came down [PERSON] on the side of President [PERSON] and his ban on federal funds going to family planning facilities where abortions are performed. In its 7-4 decision, the [ORGANIZATION]1 ruled in favor of allowing the [PERSON] administrations [ORGANIZATION] rule to stand while a [ORGANIZATION]5 lawsuit against it makes its [STREET] through the courts.128 [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION],  Says [ORGANIZATION]6 [PERSON], which takes [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION] with only animal characters, is specifically depicting a white supremacist society Well, it was bound to happen. One of the woke writers at [PERSON]3 found something political to nitpick about [ORGANIZATION]7 remake of [PERSON]. Rather than let everyone enjoy one of childhoods great classics, PERSON98 tried to burst the bubble, pointing out how its a fascistic story that incorporates the white supremacists worldview. Good grief.130 GPE73 [STREET] Orders Father to Raise His Son as a Transsexual131 With DATE71 it seems more like we are simply in a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil A GPE73 father has been legally prohibited from raising his son as a boy because his ex-wife allegedly decided their son is a transgender girl and is preparing him for chemical castration at DATE72 and a future sex change surgery, which the father may be forced to help pay for. Comment The mother a doctor is a woke fool. When her son finally comes to his senses when he grows older he will come to resent his mother for putting him through this insanity132 GPE74 [ORGANIZATION]8 Melts Down Over Prospect of Canadians Being Allowed to See Pro-Life Film133 Left-wing newspapers certainly arent the defenders of free expression they used to be. GPE75-based journalist PERSON99 filed a fear-mongering report for the GPE74s [ORGANIZATION]8 newspaper DATE33, Activists condemn Canadian cinema chain for screening anti-abortion film [ORGANIZATION]9 criticized for screening Unplanned, which is said to promote falsehoods about reproductive health. Previously, the movies producers said the pro-life film had been effectively banned in GPE75 due to several prominent Canadian distributors, including ORG90, refusing to pick up the film because of its pro-life content. ORG90 has evidently changed its mind and will now run the film. Now the left-wing GPE74 paper is furious at the cinema chains audacity to actually screen a movie with a premise liberals find to be suffused with wrongthink the few liberals that have actually bothered to watch it, anyway, rather than condemning it sight unseen.

She did not specify how this b[PERSON]ance might be achieved, or who would have the last word in defining it. Seemingly suggesting that suppressing free speech to some unspecified extent would be the [STREET] to go in de[PERSON]ing with cases of extreme violence, this [PERSON] offici[PERSON] made it clear that it was once again soci[PERSON] media that politicians would like to see moderate and censor even more than they do now. 128 ORG59 [ORGANIZATION] in New Round of Layoffs129 [DATE]7 ORG35ORG59 laid off 150 employees [ORGANIZATION] as the streaming giant faces subscriber losses, slower revenue growth and a shareholder lawsuit.

And so far, the police have been successful in turning the tide, with [PERSON]7 [PERSON]ready poised to drop a law banning faci[PERSON] scanning not even [DATE] after it was adopted.

Indeed, [PERSON]2s [PERSON], An Act to amend the Youth Protection Act and other legislative provisions, was adopted on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]8 and became law on DATE52. This has many parents, and [PERSON]2ers in gener[PERSON], quite worried, since the amendment concerns the governments power over child custody. The law will prioritize the custody of children to ORG77 instead of the childs natur[PERSON] family, consequently encroaching on parent[PERSON] rights. Therefore, any family involved with youth protection services could now lose custody of their child if the department deems it best for the childs he[PERSON]th. However, the amendments brought to the bill are much more complex, thats why [PERSON], a lawyer and [PERSON] from [PERSON]3, sat down with us to better explain the bills implications and to bring attention to what he considers a potenti[PERSON] risk to our democracy.

But if we examine the present pantheon of progressive icons, and strip away their reliance on liberal-media protection and transfer them instead into the present age of tabloid promiscuity and cyber omnipresence, would we now have a very different view of their presidencies? The progressive [LOCATION]0 administration likely would never have completed its two elected terms had it operated on media protocols common [ORGANIZATION]. For [PERSON] during the failing health and death of First Lady [LOCATION]1, the president fell into a state of debilitating depression, carefully hidden from the press. DATE8, during DATE9 of [LOCATION]2 presidency, he was more or less unable to fulfill his duties due to a series of strokes that left him partially paralyzed and visually impaired. Those realities were carefully hidden from the public by the efforts of his second wife, [LOCATION]3, and physician Dr. [LOCATION]4. In the present case, we know that [LOCATION]5 is neither comatose nor is [LOCATION] running the country. The country never learned the full extent of [LOCATION]5 paralysis. Much less did it know of [LOCATION]9s past and ongoing affairs  the mechanics of which were sometimes carried out in FAC1 and with the skillful aid of his own daughter [LOCATION]6. By [LOCATION]0, [LOCATION]7, seeking a fourth term, was suffering from a series of life-threatening conditions. Worrying that the public would not vote yet again for a terminally ill president, sympathetic journalists and military physicians covered up [LOCATION]7s illnesses  on the theory that [LOCATION]9 would survive long enough to get elected to a fourth term and ensure a continued Democratic administration.  [PERSON]0, by contemporary standards, was a serial sexual harasser, if not a likely assaulter. While physically in FAC1 he carried on sexual trysts with subordinates and others without security clearances, mostly with the full knowledge of the complacent [ORGANIZATION]6 press corps. One former [PERSON]1 intern, [PERSON]2, later wrote a memoir describing losing her virginity at [LOCATION]1 to the president in FAC1 presidential bed. [PERSON]3 was not just a serial adulterer and often corrupt, but displayed a level of crudity that would now be seen as clinical, from conducting business while defecating on the toilet to exposing his genitals to staff  apparently as some sort of Freudian proof of his own, and by extension, his nations, manhood.  There is no reason to review the escapades of an impeached [LOCATION]2. Despite the efforts of a sympathetic media, many of his transgressions were in part aired to the public. They ran the full gamut of a classical sexist and misogynist, from likely sexually assaulting chance acquaintances to attempting to defame and ruin the reputations of women deemed liable to disclose past liaisons. What differentiates [LOCATION]5s womanizing from that of prior presidents, like [LOCATION]4s, is that his escapades were prior to, not during, his presidential service. A study published by the liberal [ORGANIZATION]7 found that coverage of the [LOCATION]5 presidency in [LOCATION]2 was [LOCATION]4 percent negative, as evidenced in [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]9 and [ORGANIZATION], in addition to ORG21, ORG22, ORG23 and [PERSON] parent ORG25, as well as European news outlets ORG26, ORG27 and ORG28 in [LOCATION]. The same researchers found that coverage of [LOCATION]5 was about twice as negative as had been true of reporting on [PERSON]6. NOTA BENE [PERSON]7 escapades have yet to be shared, but they will surface eventually52 Destroying GPE7 From Within, Part 353 by [PERSON]8 Once muslims have established a mosque and created an enclave they begin to grow the population. They use population to take a country over. A popular must have 2.5 children per married couple. Most places are producing less than that but the muslim populations in the [LOCATION], [LOCATION], [PERSON]0 and even GPE7 are producing 5-7 children per married couple. They will actually out populate the local people. Their population growth is where they do their dirty work on the nations they immigrate to. When the Muslim population remains at or under 2, their presence tends to fly low under the radar. In the 2  5 range, Muslims begin to seek converts, targeting those they see as disaffected, such as criminals. When the population reaches 5 they exert influence disproportionate to their numbers, becoming more aggressive and pushing for Sharia law. When the population hits the 10 mark Muslims become increasingly lawless and violent. Once the population reaches 20, there is an increase in rioting, murder, jihad militias, and destruction of non-Muslim places of worship. At [LOCATION]3, there are widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare. Once beyond [DATE], infidels and apostates are persecuted, genocide occurs, and Sharia law is implemented. After [LOCATION]4, intimidation is a [LOCATION]5 part of life along with violent jihad and some state-run genocide as the nation purges all infidels. Once the nation has rid itself of all non-Muslims, the presumption is that [LOCATION] has been attained  ORG30 What does it look like in GPE7? Not good for our kids and grandkids.

The first electrical blackout, which swept across the nation on [DATE]1, left [LOCATION]0 with only two percent connectivity amid the ongoing presidential crisis. Most of the country has been offline since [DATE]1 with limited or no connectivity being reported across large swaths of the South [LOCATION] nation. [PERSON], a private internet watchdog organization based in the [LOCATION], reported on [DATE]8 that 96 percent of the country was offline.108 [LOCATION]0s Long [STREET] to Ruin109 Few Countries Have Provided Such a Perfect Example of Socialist Policies in Practice Word from [LOCATION]1 is that locals have taken to scouring city streets for plastic garbage bags full of rubbish and, when they find them, emptying the contents so that they can resell the bags. This sounds absurd, but it is believable in a country where extreme poverty has spread like the plague. Human capital is fleeing. Oil production is plummeting, and the state-owned oil company is in default. The garbage bag, imported with dollars, is a thing of value. If anything was more predictable than the mess created by PERSON83 Bolivarian Revolution, it is the pathetic effort by socialists to deny responsibility. [ORGANIZATION] tweeted recently that [LOCATION]0s problem is that socialism has yet to be tried. It blamed the crisis on a profit-driven capitalist economy under leftist state-control. Even more preposterous is the claim by some academics that economic liberalism in the 19[LOCATION]4s spawned the socialism that has destroyed the country. Learning from history is impossible if the narrative is wrong. So lets clear the record By the time PERSON84 was elected, [LOCATION]0 already had [LOCATION]3 [DATE] of socialism under its belt and precious little, if any, experience with free markets. Military dictator [PERSON] was toppled in [ORGANIZATION]1. PERSON86, an avowed socialist, was elected president [ORGANIZATION]2. When [LOCATION]0 promulgated its [ORGANIZATION]3 constitution, PERSON87 immediately suspended Article 96, which read All can freely engage in the profitable activity of their choice, without any limitations other than those provided for in this Constitution and those established by law for security, health or other reasons of social interest. This crucial protection remained on the shelf for [ORGANIZATION]4, as a string of socialist governments employed price and exchange controls in counterproductive attempts to raise living standards. Rent control in [LOCATION]0 dates to [ORGANIZATION]5 but was not enforced by Prez PERSON88. In [ORGANIZATION]6 PERSON87 revived it, passing a new rent-control law and prohibitions on eviction. Since then, not one apartment rental building has been built, writes PERSON89 in his [DATE] book, [LOCATION]0n [ORGANIZATION]. The legendary slums that climb [LOCATION]1s hillsides are a testament to this socialist stupidity.  PERSON90 took office for a second time in [ORGANIZATION]7 and restored price and exchange controls. By [ORGANIZATION]8, facing another collapse, he reversed course again, liberating prices and opening markets. The adjustment exposed reality but was painful, especially in the face of falling oil prices. Thus, the ground was fertile for an antiestablishment candidate in [ORGANIZATION]9. PERSON84 was inaugurated in [PERSON]0, in the midst of a recovery in oil prices and with the bolivar at 576 to the dollar. He tripled down on socialism, exacerbating a long history of destroying capital that would lead to [PERSON]1 disaster.

baltimore,2018-10-11T00:00:00Z,Impact News Service,The Baltimore Sun,"homeless, homelessness",EXECUTIVE CALENDAR ([ORGANIZATION]),"The Senator from [ORGANIZATION]. S. [DATE] Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I rise to convey my strong support for the [PERSON]1s Water Infrastructure Act, which passed [ORGANIZATION] earlier [LOCATION]. With communities throughout [ORGANIZATION] and the country working to improve the quality of their drinking water, bracing for rising seas and more intense storms, and seeking to be more competitive in the global economy, this legislative package will provide welcome relief and support for critical infrastructure. I have long focused on providing resources needed to improve the maritime linchpin of my [PERSON] economy FAC0. But this economic engine needs direct [ORGANIZATION] funding to fire on all cylinders, especially as we transition to a new, supersized shipping era. DATE0, FAC1 completed an expansion project that allows bigger vessels, called [ORGANIZATION] ships, to pass through the canal. These ships, which are the length of aircraft carriers and can carry more than three times as much cargo as their competitors, are too large to dock at FAC0 [LOCATION]. That is why, in the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] water resources bill, I fought to authorize 216 million in [ORGANIZATION] funding for the FAC0 improvement project, which will deepen the [INSTITUTION] to accommodate those [ORGANIZATION] ships. I am pleased that my provision dedicating an additional 16 million to this crucial project was included in the [ORGANIZATION] water resources bill. The FAC0 improvement project is projected to double the harbors container volume, protect and grow 7,000 jobs, and generate 4.6 billion in economic activity throughout the [ORGANIZATION] region. It is a simple formula Larger ships mean more cargo, more cargo means more commerce, and more commerce means more jobs for [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [ORGANIZATION]. I am pleased that the ORG2 has to date allocated 91 million of funding to this critical project thus far, but deepening the [INSTITUTION] alone does not ensure that the [INSTITUTION] of [ORGANIZATION] can accommodate these new, gargantuan giants of the seas. We must also deepen the berths, the area where the ships dock. That is why I am proud to secure a provision in this bill that will allow the [INSTITUTION] to construct more expansive berths, and I am pleased to help secure [ORGANIZATION] S6749 a 42 million [ORGANIZATION] grant to expand these berths. By no means is FAC0 the only coastal gem in [ORGANIZATION]. In [DATE], we will be celebrating the 400th anniversary of the voyage of the [ORGANIZATION] and the settlement at GPE3, but the celebration wont be complete if the ships cant get into and out of GPE3 [INSTITUTION]. Regrettably, GPE3 [INSTITUTION] has filled up with so much sand that ships are having trouble navigating--including the centerpiece of the celebration, the newly restored [ORGANIZATION] II. That is why I secured a provision in this bill requiring the ORG2 to dredge this important landmark for the 400th anniversary. DATE5, I helped secure 14.5 million needed to ensure that this hallmark of [PERSON]1n history is swiftly deepened. With this statutory requirement and funding, GPE3 [INSTITUTION] will be able to host a great birth[ORGANIZATION]8 party in [DATE]--one that [PERSON]1ns from all corners of the country and people from around the world are going to attend. But those [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]6rs living on [ORGANIZATION] will most likely experience a little traffic on the [STREET] to the event because [ORGANIZATION] is only accessible by two bridges, which span the [ORGANIZATION] Canal. If [ORGANIZATION] is the arm of [ORGANIZATION], then these two bridges are the vital arteries delivering the islands lifeblood. The strength of those two bridges will determine the strength of the islands economy and health and well-being. Regrettably, these two [ORGANIZATION] bridges, which are owned by the [ORGANIZATION] ORG2, are structurally deficient. That is a problem for businesses that need an uninterrupted flow of commerce and residents who must have a safe means of evacuation in the event of an emergency. Imagine if there were an accident at FAC5 or the equivalent of a Hurricane [PERSON]ia. These two bridges are the only [STREET] for many [ORGANIZATION] residents to escape to safety. I am proud that this bill includes my provision directing the ORG2 to replace these critical evacuation routes, helping preserve the very safety of island residents. In a time of emergency, [ORGANIZATION] residents shouldnt have to think twice about the best [STREET] to get their families to safety. The bill also includes legislation that I have authored to help protect consumers from unjust and unreasonable increases in their electricity rates. Right [LOCATION]54, if the [ORGANIZATION] Energy Regulatory Commission has a vacancy--as is currently the case--and deadlocks 2 to 2 on whether to improve a rate increase, the increase goes forward. To make matters worse, the public cant even challenge a decision in this circumstance. That is exactly what happened in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], leading to a 2 billion increase for our regions consumers. My legislation would fix that by allowing the public to bring a challenge when [ORGANIZATION] deadlocks, as they can for every other [ORGANIZATION] decision. In sports, a tie isnt a loss, and the Fair RATES Act will ensure that a tie at [ORGANIZATION] wont mean consumers lose with higher electricity rates. We must ensure that ratepayers are protected from unjust and unreasonable increases in energy prices. The legislation will help return the power to the people when it comes to energy prices by providing an outlet for consumers to challenge rate increases. I thank Senators [PERSON] and PERSON2 for working with me to move this legislation forward, and I thank my great partner in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]man PERSON3, for his tireless work to address this issue and to protect consumers. I am pleased that this legislation contains several other key provisions that increase the funding caps for three coastal protection programs, allowing the towns of GPE4, [PERSON], and GPE6 to implement larger beach-nourishment projects--pumping sand onto the beach--to protect their communities reevaluate the LOC2 environmental restoration project to pave the [STREET] for reauthorizing this crucial project permit the town of GPE6 to use sand pumped from the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Canal that otherwise would be dumped in the ocean to fortify their town from rising seas ensure that the ORG2 takes on all the costs to repair the town of GPE6s beaches, which experience severe erosion due to the jetties at the mouth of [ORGANIZATION] Canal and require the ORG7 to appoint liaisons to minority, [PERSON], and low-income communities so these disenfranchised groups can have better access to the resources and tools provided by the [ORGANIZATION] Government to improve the quality of our ORG9 drinking water. From fortifying our communities, to dealing with the [ORGANIZATION] impacts of climate change, to eradicating the environmental contaminants of DATE8 from our water infrastructure, this legislation package will provide the funding and direction needed to help modernize the [LOCATION] water infrastructure. I thank Chairman [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON] for working with me on this important legislation. I was proud to vote in favor of [PERSON]1s Water Infrastructure Act [LOCATION]. It is something that I think is going to work very successfully for the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [ORGANIZATION]. It is something that, in my opinion, is the quintessential example of how bipartisanship should, in fact, animate the legislative process in this body. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant [PERSON] proceeded to call the roll. Ms. [PERSON]. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [PERSON]. 63 Ms. [PERSON]. Mr. President, just a little bit ago, [TIME], we had a matter before the [ORGANIZATION]0 relating to [PERSON]. 63. This was a resolution of disapproval, which would have worked to disapprove of the rule that was issued jointly by the [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, and [ORGANIZATION]3 regarding these short-term, limited duration insurance plans. I had hoped, actually, to have an opportunity to speak to this prior to the vote but was not able to. I want to take just a couple of minutes [TIME] to weigh in on this issue from an [LOCATION] perspective. I think there have been some suggestions that with this rule in [STREET], those of us who care about protecting those with preexisting conditions, somehow or another, are taking these protections away. I have weighed this carefully. In fairness, I think some of the arguments that have been made are, perhaps, not quite as clear cut as would be suggested and, perhaps, certainly, in a [ORGANIZATION]6 like mine, where we still have the highest healthcare costs in the country and some of the highest costs for coverage in the country. I think Members here in the [ORGANIZATION]0 k[LOCATION]54 full well that while I have opposed many aspects of the Affordable Care Act, I have supported and have strongly supported certain parts of it as well. Again, one of those things that I feel very strongly about is the need to ensure that we protect those who have preexisting conditions. That is a debate that, I think, is ongoing in other places as well. Yet I want to make clear that, certainly, my vote [TIME] is in no [STREET] meant to erode or undermine where I am coming from when it comes to preexisting conditions. Back to the situation that we face in GPE7, as I mentioned, we are the highest in terms of the cost of care and the highest in terms of the cost of coverage, and we are still one of those [PERSON] that has but one insurer on the exchange in GPE7. So our options are, really, pretty limited. As I am speaking to individuals about what they are hoping for when it comes to coverage, they are looking for additional options, but they are looking for affordable options as well. It is true--it is absolutely true--that these short-term plans do not offer as much or, certainly, may not offer as much in the [STREET] of coverage as those plans that are offered on the individual exchanges. I understand that, but I have had to come down on this issue on the side of more choice for consumers and more options being a good thing for consumers. In GPE7, our population, as one k[LOCATION]54s, is relatively small. We have about 720,000 people in the whole [ORGANIZATION]6, but we are talking about 18,000 people, give or take, who are enrolled on the individual exchanges [PERSON]. The [ORGANIZATION] S6750 universe here is 18,000 people when we are talking about the exchanges. In [LOCATION]7 [ORGANIZATION], which was [LOCATION]1 about which the [ORGANIZATION]4 can give us information, there were about 15,000 people who chose to pay the individual mandate penalty rather than to buy the insurance. Think about what that means. They are weighing this, and they are saying I would rather pay a fine, pay that penalty. It is not that I dont want the insurance, but I cannot afford it. So you had 18,000 people on the individual exchanges, and 15,000 people chose to pay the individual mandate penalty rather than buy the insurance. That is because, if an [LOCATION] does not get the subsidy--and a pretty heavy subsidy--the exchange plans just arent affordable. Even though you want to have that coverage--you want that insurance--wanting it doesnt necessarily get it to you if you cannot afford it. The average premium for [LOCATION]2--this is according to [ORGANIZATION]5 data--is [DATE]. What am I getting from constituents, from folks who are writing in to me and calling me? They are telling me what they are paying for their plans. For a family of four, the premium was over 2,000 a month, with a 7,500 deductible. Think about what that actually means for this family, for folks with those kinds of bills, who, basically, only have catastrophic coverage, as it is. Again, you think about the number of folks on the individual exchanges, and you think about those who choose not to pay the fines. You look at the numbers of those who receive the subsidies in the [ORGANIZATION]6 of GPE7, which is quite considerable. We also have about 10,000 or so [LOCATION]s--this is according to the [ORGANIZATION]6 division of insurance--who have enrolled in healthcare sharing ministries. This is yet another option for people out there. A significant number has turned to these healthcare sharing ministries, and these folks have managed to avoid the penalty in [LOCATION]3. In fairness, some of the ministry plans do not provide much in the [STREET] of coverage, but it is an indicator of what people feel they have to do in the face of just very, very high-cost plans. I understand where those who oppose this rule are coming from, and I have had good, long conversations about this. I guess I would ask that they turn to the realities that we are facing in a [ORGANIZATION]6 like GPE7 and just appreciate where people are coming from when you think about the 15,000 [LOCATION]s who have chosen not to buy insurance over [LOCATION]4 because it has been too expensive, but they want to have something they can afford. These short-term plans, while not ideal--I am not suggesting that they are--are an option for them to consider. What about the people who dont get subsidies and are paying over 50,000 per [ORGANIZATION]3 before their insurance covers anything? That too is a situation in which they are looking for alternatives. So perhaps these short-term plans could be a viable option. For the 10,000-some-odd people who are currently using a sharing ministry, again, these types of plans could be an alternative. For the people who may choose to drop off the individual exchanges [LOCATION]5, these plans could be a path forward for some having some level of coverage. Again, I am not saying that this is perfect, and I am not saying that this is ideal. I am saying it offers a limited option in a [STREET] in which we have very few affordable options to turn to. Another reason these shorter term plans are helpful for us and why I have heard from so many [LOCATION]s on this is that we are a [ORGANIZATION]6 in which our employment base is very, very seasonal. You have a construction industry, but it is not like it is back here. Construction is, maybe, [LOCATION]6 out of [LOCATION]7--longer in some parts of the [ORGANIZATION]6 and shorter in other parts of the [ORGANIZATION]6. Yet you have a seasonal job. Our fishing industry is a great example. If you are working in the processing end of fishing, it may be [LOCATION]8. If you are working as a crabber, it may be [LOCATION]9. If you are working on a tender up in [ORGANIZATION], it may be [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]1. Then we have [ORGANIZATION]2. Again, we would like to think that we can entice you all to come up [ORGANIZATION]3 round, but quite honestly, it too is very, very seasonal. So we need to have some level of flexibility for those many, many [LOCATION]s who move between many of these seasonal employment opportunities. Under the prior rule, a short-term insurance plan could only last for [LOCATION]8. That is not going to help out, say, those in the fishing or in the tourism industry or, again, in so many of these areas in which you need longer term coverage but you dont need a full [ORGANIZATION]3. So flexibility is something that people have been asking for as well. Where that sweet spot is, I am not sure. I am telling you that, for us, [LOCATION]8 doesnt make it. Maybe 3 [ORGANIZATION]3s is too long. Maybe we do need to look at that. I happen to think that we do, but that is an area that is open for review. The last point I would make is that I think we have to have some trust in both our [PERSON] as regulators and in individuals, the consumers. The rule that we were speaking about [TIME] really does allow [PERSON] to have a great deal of leeway in regulating at the local level. We are seeing that among many of the [PERSON]. I had a long conversation with our director of insurance up in the [ORGANIZATION]6 of GPE7. We talked about where our [ORGANIZATION]6 might take this and looked again at, perhaps, the length of these short-term, limited duration plans and how they might be regulated. Also, there is the transparency side of this, and this is something that concerns me. Some of the things we have heard are that people have bought these less expensive plans, these shorter term plans, and then, when they need them the most, they realize the coverage doesnt take care of them. That is also not a [STREET] we want anyone to be. Making sure that there is a level of transparency, that there is a level of disclosure that is real and not just the tiny boilerplate that nobody can understand--it has to be, again, transparent in that [STREET]. I think this is one of those areas where trusting in our laboratories of democracy, which are our [PERSON], to tailor plans that fit a [ORGANIZATION]6 well should not be an action that we here in the [ORGANIZATION]0 are so unwilling to take. As we look to how we do more in this [ORGANIZATION] and how we do more to help those for whom healthcare--the cost of healthcare and access to healthcare--is still their No. 1 issue, still the No. 1 subject of discussion, I have come to speak on this particular issue [LOCATION] because there are maybe 25,000 people in my [ORGANIZATION]6 who could see some benefit from these types of plans being available and also because I believe that trusting the regulators, certainly in my [ORGANIZATION]6, to handle the plans intelligently is an important part of how we move forward as well. I wanted to put that on the record [LOCATION] following the discussion from earlier [TIME] and the vote at [TIME]. [ORGANIZATION] President, I want to transition really quickly and just take [TIME] because [ORGANIZATION]6, as we all k[LOCATION]54, was a very difficult time in the [ORGANIZATION]0 as we processed the nomination of Judge [PERSON] to serve on [ORGANIZATION]7. That vote has concluded. Judge [PERSON] is [LOCATION]54 [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], and I truly wish him all the best as he begins his new term on the highest [STREET] in the land. But there is a residue--I dont k[LOCATION]54 if it is a residue. I dont k[LOCATION]54 how we make sure we are able to move forward after difficult votes that divide us all and work to come back together. I am going to speak very directly about my friend who sits right here next to me on the [ORGANIZATION]0 floor. She and I went through, probably, a similar deliberative process. It was probably the same as everybody else here on the floor, but we perhaps shared more discussion about it than I did with other colleagues. At the end of [ORGANIZATION]8, we came down on different sides, but both of us--both of us--agonized over the decision and the process. She is [LOCATION]54 enduring an active campaign against her. It is not just an active campaign against her, but there are protests at her home [ORGANIZATION]7, and she cannot travel without a police escort. I made comments as I prepared for the final vote [ORGANIZATION]6. I said We are better than this. We have to set the example here. I am really touched that after I had taken a hard vote within my caucus, [ORGANIZATION] S6751 there are some who are notably angry at me. But we are working together on the next issue of [ORGANIZATION]8, and we are moving forward. We need to set that example in this body because if we dont set it here, I dont k[LOCATION]54 how we can expect anyone on the outside to follow us. There is a need for civility. It is a hard time for us, but I would urge us all to choose our words carefully. Dont be afraid to speak with kindness toward one another. Dont be afraid to call out the good in somebody else, even though you have voted against them. We are better than what we are seeing right [LOCATION]54. I am smiling only because I feel I should recommend that my colleagues watch a movie, a documentary. I dont do that often, but after the vote on [ORGANIZATION]9, I just, by chance, picked up a DVD that had been sent to me. It is a documentary about the life and career of PERSON9--Mister [PERSON]0--Wont You Be My Neighbor? I figured I needed something kind of calming for [TIME]. It is OK to be good to one another. It is OK to accept people for who they are. It is OK to just find the good. With that, Mr. President, I thank you for allowing me to speak a little bit from the heart. I would ask us to be civil with one another [LOCATION]54, not civil when the next election comes. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]1. The clerk will call the roll. The [PERSON] proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]2. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. [PERSON]2. Mr. President, I will oppose the pending nomination of [PERSON]3 to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of [ORGANIZATION]8 [ORGANIZATION]9 Division. This is the division that leads [ORGANIZATION] enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. Mr. [PERSON]4 is not the right person for that job. In [ORGANIZATION], he said the science of climate change is contestable. He represented ORG21 in litigation over the [PERSON] explosion and oil spill. He has represented ORG22 and other industry groups in challenging ORG7 greenhouse gas regulations. He is a favorite of the [ORGANIZATION]ist Society, having chaired that groups environmental law and practice group. But his nomination is strongly opposed by groups that care about protecting the environment. [PERSON] called him an outspoken opponent of environmental and public health protection. ORG25 described him as an enemy of the environment. He is exactly the wrong person to be in this job of enforcing regulations to protect our environment. Just during [ORGANIZATION]0, the [ORGANIZATION] put out an alert to all of the members around the world. We are going to pay dearly for this current administrations decision to remove ourselves from the Paris Agreement, where literally every country on [ORGANIZATION] agreed to try to do something to clean up the mess of our environment and leave our children a better [STREET] to live. We decided, under President [PERSON]5, to be the only GPE84 to step away from it. Why? What in the world were we thinking? Can you believe that things that are happening that are easily documented can be ignored? Do you see the flooding that is going on [LOCATION]54 in [LOCATION] on a regular basis? That is just 1 of 1,000 different examples. If we dont accept responsibility in our generation to make this a better world, shame on us. We want to leave our kids a better world, but for goodness sake, do we have the political courage to do it? Will we be able to say to the President You are just wrong. We have to work together with nations around the world. The United [PERSON] should be a leader, not an apologist. The President said he wants to make [PERSON]1 first. How about [PERSON]1 first when it comes to cleaning up the environment? There is nothing wrong with that leadership. It is something we should be proud of. This man, [PERSON]3, who is aspiring to be the Assistant Attorney General, just doesnt buy into what I just said, and I cant support him as a result. S. [DATE] Mr. President, the [ORGANIZATION]1 WRDA bill--[ORGANIZATION]--that we are considering on the floor [ORGANIZATION]2 is an important step in modernizing our ORG9 water infrastructure and ensuring access to clean drinking water. It goes back to my earlier comment. If we are talking about the environment, one of the first things people say is, I want safe drinking water for myself and my family. Next to that, I want to be able to breathe in air that is not going to make me sick or hurt any member of my family. Our ORG9 infrastructure is aging and in need of significant investment. Last [ORGANIZATION]3, the [PERSON]1n [ORGANIZATION] gave our ORG9 levees, inland waterways, and drinking water infrastructure a D rating in terms of its infrastructure report card. They estimate that 80 billion is needed over [ORGANIZATION]4 to improve our ORG9 levees--80 billion. They also estimate that 4.9 billion is needed over the next 2 [ORGANIZATION]3s to maintain our inland waterways--4.9 billion-- and 1 trillion is needed over the next 25 [ORGANIZATION]3s to expand our drinking water infrastructure. These are massive numbers, and they are going to require sustained and significant [ORGANIZATION] investment if we are ever going to reach these goals. This bill--the WRDA bill--is a step in the right direction. It authorizes 6.1 billion in funding for the [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 flood control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration projects around the country. These are critical projects in every [ORGANIZATION]6. I just went down [ORGANIZATION]7 with Senator [PERSON]6 to [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] that has been under construction for [ORGANIZATION]8 is finally completed. It is an amazing investment. It is the most expensive civil infrastructure project in our ORG9 history, and it is an indication of the kind of investment that is necessary if we are going to try to tame rivers like [PERSON]. There are critical projects like that in every [ORGANIZATION]6. They improve our inland waterways to help deliver 600 million in goods and 60 percent of our grain imports [PERSON]. If we want the United [PERSON] to literally lead the world--if we want [PERSON]1 first--for goodness sake, we need to be first in investing in our infrastructure. These projects maintain levees and build reservoirs that protect millions of people and an estimated 1.3 trillion in property, and they protect the environment, they restore wetlands, and they prevent the spread of invasive species. I am especially proud that this bill includes an important cost share change for the future operations and maintenance costs at FAC8 in my [ORGANIZATION]6 of [PERSON]3. I worked with Senator [PERSON]7 on this project. The [ORGANIZATION] project is integral to ensuring that invasive [ORGANIZATION]9n carp never spread to [ORGANIZATION]. Knock on wood. We have held up that carp from going into [ORGANIZATION] and, in doing so, we have preserved an important part of the fisheries and the lake itself. I want to continue those efforts, if not redouble them. While I am proud to support passage of this authorizing bill, I also implore my colleagues to remember that unless we are willing to work together--Republicans and Democrats--to provide these authorized projects with consistent and increased appropriations [PERSON], then we are sending out press releases and not even getting the job half done. Let me say it another [STREET] It is not enough to go home and take credit for passing the WRDA bill, which is an authorization bill, if you arent also willing to pass an appropriations bill that actually provides the money to break ground on these projects. An authorization bill is just that It gives you permission to do a project, but then you need to go to the spending bill--the appropriations bill--to come up with the money to actually achieve it. Listen to this number. I want to make this part of the record as we debate water resources and infrastructure. An analysis by the ORG29 newspaper from earlier this [ORGANIZATION]3 found that while [ORGANIZATION] has authorized more than 25 billion toward [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 projects in [DATE]0 billion in [DATE]1--[ORGANIZATION] has [ORGANIZATION] S6752 only appropriated 689 million. So 25 billion authorized, 689 million appropriated. What percentage of money have we actually come up with to finish these projects? We have come up with only 689 million out of 25 billion--2.7 percent. We send out all of these press releases congratulating ourselves about projects that are never going to happen. We send out the releases and say This is going to be great for future generations. We are not doing it. We are not investing in [PERSON]1. Slow and inconsistent [ORGANIZATION] funding for these projects results in [ORGANIZATION]3s of added delay and millions in added costs. Instead of funding new projects, we have to spend more on ongoing projects because [ORGANIZATION] just doesnt get its act together--Democrats and Republicans. I am proud of the work of ORG30 on which I have been honored to serve. Both sides of the aisle do work to get their job done in record time and ensure the ORG2 has stable funding for the next fiscal [ORGANIZATION]3, but this [ORGANIZATION]3s appropriations process should not be unusual. Unless we as a [ORGANIZATION] commit every [ORGANIZATION]3 to getting our budget work done and appropriating these [ORGANIZATION] dollars, we will never get ahead on investing in our infrastructure. Our competitors like [PERSON]4 and others around the world are making massive investments in infrastructure not just in their own country but in other countries that are teaming up with them, with an economic vision for the future. What is our goal? What are we trying to achieve right here in the United [PERSON], and how are we working to build our economy and create good-paying jobs for the future? Our ORG9 water infrastructure is in need of significant investment. The good bill we are considering [LOCATION] is just a step in the right direction, but an authorization bill without appropriation is just an empty press release. I hope we can work together to ensure funding gets appropriated [PERSON] to actually complete these important projects. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The [PERSON] proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]8. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]9. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering PERSON20 Mr. [PERSON]8. Mr. President, I regret to inform our colleagues of the death of PERSON21, who died on [DATE]5, succumbing to cancer at [DATE]6. Senator [PERSON] was one of the most outspoken progressive Democrats in this body. He was born to privilege. His father was a Democratic Senator from the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [PERSON]8--a conservative Democratic Senator. His grandfather was one of our first Ambassadors to [PERSON]6. His paternal grandfather married PERSON23, who built ORG31, which most of us k[LOCATION]54 is in [PERSON]7. He came from a family of great privilege. Yet he was k[LOCATION]54n in [PERSON]8 as a person of the people, representing the people of our [ORGANIZATION]6. His first elected office was president of the Young Democrats of [PERSON]8. From there, he became a member of the [PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION]1 of [LOCATION], where he fought the establishment, took on the network in [PERSON]9, and investigated the savings and loan situation in our [ORGANIZATION]6. He really shined a lot of light on what was happening in abuses in that industry. He was chosen by then-Senator PERSON3 to head up his campaign for President. PERSON21 handled his campaign in [PERSON]8 for President and helped in other primaries around the GPE84, leading to President [PERSON] election as President of the United [PERSON]. President PERSON3 asked him to serve as the [ORGANIZATION]0 attorney for [PERSON]8, and Senator [PERSON] served as the [ORGANIZATION]0 attorney. He was k[LOCATION]54n for his independence at the [ORGANIZATION]0 Attorneys Office. He pursued white collar crime and political corruption. He indicted and convicted a former Member of [ORGANIZATION], as well as the speaker of the [PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION]1 of [LOCATION]. He recruited young talent to his office in the [ORGANIZATION]0 Attorneys Office, including PERSON25, who went on to become the Attorney General of the United [PERSON], and PERSON26, who continued to become the attorney general for the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [PERSON]8. In [DATE]7 he ran and was elected to the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]0. He worked on progressive causes, including the Voting Rights Act, which he helped to get enacted under President PERSON27, and also gun safety legislation. After leaving the [ORGANIZATION]0 after one term, he continued to be extremely active in our community. He was best k[LOCATION]54n, I believe, for his work at the University of [PERSON]8. He served three terms on the board of regents of the University of [PERSON]8 system, giving back to the school where he graduated from both undergraduate and law school, and he was k[LOCATION]54n as one of the most aggressive people in the reform of our University of [PERSON]8 System and also in the independence of the university hospital. On a personal note, let me tell you that he helped with my election to the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]0 12 [ORGANIZATION]3s ago and gave me a great deal of support and friendship and was an adviser and role model for me. I remember his being here when I took the oath of office as a Senator, walking me down the aisle. I had a great deal of pride that he was with me. He is going to be missed by all of us--just an incredible person, a person who put his principles over practical politics. It may have cost him an election, but he did what he thought was right. I can tell you that we are all proud of his service to the people of [PERSON]8 and our GPE84. Mr. President, we will miss this man, who was determined to help bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice as fast as possible. PERSON21 was born as PERSON28 in [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, on [DATE]9 to PERSON29 of [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]4, and PERSON30 of [ORGANIZATION]1. [PERSON] sister, PERSON31, was born in DATE50. In DATE51, his parents divorced, and his mother married [PERSON] [PERSON], who was then serving his second of four terms as one of [PERSON]8s [ORGANIZATION]0 Senators. Several [ORGANIZATION]3s later, [PERSON] [PERSON] formally adopted [PERSON] and his sister, PERSON34. PERSON21 illustrious family included his namesake grandfather, PERSON35, an early adviser to PERSON36, who later was appointed by President PERSON37 as [PERSON]1s second Ambassador to [PERSON]6. While [PERSON] was still a boy, his maternal grandfather married one of the richest women in [PERSON]1, PERSON23, who owned homes in [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6, [ORGANIZATION] here in [ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]8, FAC10 in the [ORGANIZATION]0, and built [PERSON]-a-Lago in [PERSON]7. [PERSON] sailed home from [ORGANIZATION]1 aboard the Sea Cloud, Posts luxurious 322-foot, four- masted barque, the largest privately owned sea-going yacht in the world at the time. PERSON21 attended public schools in [ORGANIZATION]9, [PERSON], before entering ORG41 in GPE31 as a military cadet in [DATE]. After he graduated, he enlisted in the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION] in DATE54 and served in one of the [LOCATION] last horse platoons as part of the postwar occupation of GPE32. When he returned to the United [PERSON] in DATE55, he entered the University of [PERSON]8, where he played lacrosse and football and was student body president and then earned his law degree at the University of [PERSON]8 Law School in DATE56. PERSON21 was surrounded by tremendous wealth and prestige and political power while he was growing up. The obituary that appeared in ORG45 notes that, despite the fact that [PERSON] was born into a life of privilege, he was a frugal person and quotes his daughter, [PERSON]y [PERSON], as saying, He was a man of the people despite how he grew up. His adoptive father was also a Democrat but opposed some of the New Deal legislation because he was a fiscal conservative. [PERSON], on the other hand, was a progressive from the get-go and attributed his [ORGANIZATION]-born mother as the influence, but it is clear that his father, who was k[LOCATION]54n for taking principled, if often controversial, stands on many issues, also shaped [ORGANIZATION] approach to politics and to life. [ORGANIZATION] S6753 As I said earlier, PERSON21 started his political career by serving as president of the [PERSON]8 Young Democrats. While he was president, he confronted a hotel owner in GPE34 who refused to let Black members of the organization stay at the hotel for an event being held there. In DATE57, [PERSON] was elected to represent GPE35 in the [PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION]1 of [LOCATION]. Once there, it was clear that he was willing to fight established powers. He started with the [PERSON] savings and loan, ORG47, associations following a banking scandal. In [ORGANIZATION], an autobiography cowritten by former ORG48 reporter [PERSON]0 published earlier this [ORGANIZATION]3, [PERSON] reflected, I was appalled no one was doing anything about it. The reason, he argued, was that many too many [PERSON]8 politicians were profiting from the schemes that led to the scandal. While PERSON21 had a famous last name in [PERSON]8 political circles, it was his early and enthusiastic association with Senator [PERSON] that pushed [PERSON] onto the national stage. In DATE58, [PERSON] directed [PERSON] Presidential campaign in [PERSON]8 and then helped out in other primaries, at the party convention in [LOCATION], and throughout the [LOCATION]53 election. After PERSON3 won, [PERSON] was offered a post in the new administration, and he asked to be appointed [ORGANIZATION]0 attorney for [PERSON]8. The [PERSON]8 Democratic Party establishment was wary of the young reformer nearly every Democratic [ORGANIZATION]man in the [ORGANIZATION]6 opposed his appointment. President PERSON3 questioned his brother, Attorney General [PERSON] about the opposition, saying how can I appoint him with all these people opposed to him. [PERSON] replied, Thats exactly why you are going to appoint him. As [ORGANIZATION]0 attorney, PERSON21 assembled a staff of neophyte trial attorneys that included a future Attorney General of the United [PERSON], [PERSON]4, and a future Attorney General of [PERSON]8, [PERSON]5, and many other lawyers who would become judges and successful attorneys with prominent law firms. He worked hard to establish the nonpartisan reputation of the [ORGANIZATION]0 attorneys office in [PERSON]8 and build a modern [ORGANIZATION] prosecution force that has effectively targeted political corruption in [PERSON]8 up to DATE59. [PERSON] successfully prosecuted Representative [PERSON] PERSON27, a fellow Democrat, for receiving illegal gratuities. He successfully prosecuted [PERSON]8 [ORGANIZATION]1 Speaker [PERSON]7, another Democrat, for mail fraud connected with the ORG47 scandal. In [ORGANIZATION]0, President PERSON3 visited [LOCATION], the [PERSON] 550-acre estate along [ORGANIZATION]2 in GPE35, to urge [PERSON] to run for the [ORGANIZATION]0, which he agreed to do. On [ORGANIZATION]1 that [PERSON] held his farewell luncheon with colleagues to prepare for his [ORGANIZATION]0 run, he learned that President PERSON3 had been assassinated in GPE37. [PERSON] ran as a reformer and had to win a primary against the [PERSON] beloved comptroller, [PERSON]8. [PERSON], whose campaign slogan was Working for [PERSON]8, Not the [ORGANIZATION], energized reformers within the [ORGANIZATION]6 party, attracted an army of volunteers, and won. It was [PERSON]9 only loss during six [ORGANIZATION]8 in public office. [PERSON] then went on to defeat the incumbent Republican Senator, [PERSON]0, in the general election. As a Senator, PERSON21 backed the Voting Rights Act of [ORGANIZATION]3 and the Fair Housing Act of [ORGANIZATION]4. He supported controversial decisions of [ORGANIZATION]2, including the one-man, one-vote requirement for apportionment of [ORGANIZATION]6 legislatures the prohibition of prayer in public schools and the guarantee of the rights of defendants to remain silent and to be represented by counsel. He was an early advocate for family planning and worried all his life about the detrimental health and environmental effects of worldwide overpopulation. He reached across the aisle to get things done, working with Republican colleagues such as then-Representative [PERSON]1. He regularly decried the lack of bipartisanship in the [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]. Like many of his congressional peers, PERSON21 came to office supporting [PERSON]1n involvement in [LOCATION], but as the war escalated, deaths mounted, and protests spread throughout the country, [PERSON] finally broke with President [PERSON] PERSON27 and came out against the war. Although [PERSON] was ranked 100th in seniority when he arrived in the [ORGANIZATION]0, he authored legislation to make long overdue improvements to the [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] system, many of which are still in [STREET] [LOCATION]. He helped to create the system of [ORGANIZATION] magistrates to lighten the workload of [ORGANIZATION] judges improved jury selection so that [ORGANIZATION] juries more fairly represent the make-up of their communities and worked to keep unfit, unqualified, or mentally or physically incapacitated judges off the bench. [PERSON] became an enemy of President [PERSON] by helping to defeat two of the Presidents [ORGANIZATION]3 nominees, [PERSON]4, and [PERSON]5. PERSON21 was an avid outdoorsman and hunter, but supported sensible gun safety laws, including the Firearms Registration and Licensing Act, which earned him the enmity of the gun lobby and [ORGANIZATION]4. By the time he stood for reelection in [ORGANIZATION]5, [PERSON] later admitted, he had probably supported one liberal position too many. The country had changed, and [ORGANIZATION] progressive outlook had been supplanted by the backlash to new civil rights laws, fear over race riots in [PERSON]1n cities, and a deep division over [LOCATION]. Vice President [PERSON]6, who had been Governor of [PERSON]8, called [PERSON] a radical. [PERSON] narrowly lost his reelection bid to [PERSON]7, the son of the man he had defeated in [DATE]7, 51 percent to 48 percent. I mentioned that [PERSON] was an avid outdoorsman. He was also a great horseman. One of the many causes to which he dedicated his energies after he returned to private life was the protection of [PERSON] from the inhumane practice of soring. He sought vigorous implementation of the Horse Protection Act of [ORGANIZATION]5, which he had authored while still in the [ORGANIZATION]0, and was honored by the [ORGANIZATION]0 Humane Society for his efforts. After [PERSON] left the [ORGANIZATION]0, he kept his hand in [PERSON]8 politics, supporting various reform candidates and pushing for legislation to protect his beloved [ORGANIZATION]3. He went on to serve as a member and later as chairman of the board of regents of his alma mater, the University of [PERSON]8. He was appointed to three separate terms on the regents by three different Governors in three different [ORGANIZATION]8. In [ORGANIZATION]7, [PERSON] called for the board of regents of the University of [PERSON]8 to divest its endowment from companies doing business with the apartheid regime in GPE40. In [ORGANIZATION]8, then-[PERSON]8 Governor [PERSON]8 appointed [PERSON] to the board of the University of [PERSON]8 Medical System. PERSON21 was indefatigable. He built a national and international career in law, offering his legal services pro bono in cases challenging the death penalty. As ORG45 obituary noted, At an age when his peers were considering retirement, Sen. [PERSON] worked as an attorney with the [ORGANIZATION]7 law firm [ORGANIZATION]7. He didnt need to be here for the last 20 [ORGANIZATION]3s of his life, said [PERSON]9, chairman of [ORGANIZATION]8 [ORGANIZATION]7 office. But Sen. [PERSON] chose to continue to work toward causes he deemed important. It sounds a little trite, but he really was committed to basic notions of justice and fairness, [PERSON]0 said. He was not afraid to wear that on his sleeve, and he was not afraid to stand up and be counted.  When I was sworn in as [ORGANIZATION]0 Senator for the first time in the [DATE]0th [ORGANIZATION], I was honored to have PERSON21 join Senators [PERSON]1 and [PERSON]2 and escort me to the well to take the oath of office. One of his political slogans was PERSON21 doesnt duck the tough ones. So true. [ORGANIZATION] life of service serves as an example to so many people, including me, particularly in these difficult times. Former Vice President [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] wrote in the forward to [ORGANIZATION], In reading this memoir, you cant miss the salient parallels to challenges facing our nation [LOCATION]. The issues on which [PERSON] staked his [ORGANIZATION]0 career [ORGANIZATION]0 are the same ones that still require [ORGANIZATION] S6754 our advocacy and attention. Protecting voting rights. Safeguarding our environment. Pushing back against the forces of inequality that are hollowing out the middle class. Standing up for common-sense gun safety laws. In the Gospel of [PERSON]4, there is the saying, Every one to whom much is given, of him will much be required and of him to whom men commit much they will demand the more, [PERSON]4 [DATE]. PERSON21 was given much he gave back more. I k[LOCATION]54 my [ORGANIZATION]0 colleagues will want to join me in sending our condolences to PERSON21 family his sister, PERSON34 [PERSON] Russell of GPE41, [PERSON] his four children from his first marriage, [PERSON]y [PERSON] Smith of GPE42, [PERSON], [PERSON] [PERSON] of GPE43, GPE44, Emlen [PERSON] Gaudino of [PERSON]7, GPE45, and PERSON34 [PERSON] Gollob of GPE46, GPE47 and Alexandra [PERSON] Luzzatto of [ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]8, the daughter of his second marriage. He is also survived by nine grandchildren Benjamin [PERSON] Smith, PERSON71, [PERSON]7 [PERSON] Gollob, [PERSON]garet Campbell [PERSON], PERSON74, [PERSON] [PERSON], PERSON76, PERSON77, and PERSON78. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The [PERSON] proceeded to call the roll. Ms. PERSON79. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [PERSON]0 PERSON79. Mr. President, I rise [LOCATION] to thank my colleagues for passing [PERSON]1s Water Infrastructure Act of [ORGANIZATION]1 and to discuss the importance of it to the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [ORGANIZATION]7. This legislation is going [LOCATION]54 to the Presidents desk, and it is very needed to help make our ports more competitive, to protect thousands of jobs, and to help protect our salmon habitat in the [ORGANIZATION]6 of [ORGANIZATION]7. This legislation means the ports of GPE49 and [PERSON]0 will be able to deepen their harbors to allow them to meet the much larger cargo demands to compete with other ports on the [ORGANIZATION]7, specifically in [PERSON]1. This legislation also improves the critical habitat for salmon and waterways like [ORGANIZATION]4 and [ORGANIZATION]5, and it also helps utilities make commonsense investments for the future and helps to protect our ratepayers and the environment. I am proud to have worked on this legislation with our colleagues because we need to keep moving forward on investments that help make our region competitive. Our ports are essential to our economic growth in the [ORGANIZATION]6. I always say ports are us because we have so many along [ORGANIZATION]5 and on the [ORGANIZATION]7, and trade is a cornerstone of our economy, with 95 billion in exports and 92 billion in imports [PERSON]. The fact that this legislation helps us on important maintenance and operations for both large and small ports and for locks, dams, and waterways is so important to our future. It also helps us with the important alliance that GPE49 and [PERSON]0 formed together to help our marine cargo operations at the ports, which generate 4.3 billion in economic activity and on which 48,000 jobs are dependent. What happened is that as the world market changed and large containerships could double in size the amount of products they were shipping, it was so important for our [ORGANIZATION]7 ports to be competitive and to be able to serve these large ships. These megaships, which are twice the length of the space needle and wider than a football field, carry twice the number of containers compared to ships that typically call on [ORGANIZATION]7 ports and need deeper waterways. To maintain a top-grade [STREET] through the Pacific [ORGANIZATION]6 and to compete with the Canadian ports, the [ORGANIZATION] of GPE49 and [PERSON]0 have to deepen their ports and make the navigational changes to address the large container ships. The [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 and the [ORGANIZATION]6 Seaport Alliance teamed up with the GPE49 [INSTITUTION] Navigational Improvement Project study, the [PERSON]0 [INSTITUTION] Navigational Improvement Project study, and many other partners to make sure we were making the right investments. In this legislation, the [ORGANIZATION] of GPE49 and [PERSON]0 are big economic winners. They are economic winners because we are authorizing over 29 million to deepen FAC12 in the [INSTITUTION] of GPE49 to 57 feet. When the project is completed, the [INSTITUTION] of GPE49 will be the deepest in the country. It will allow us to serve those megaships. Instead of having just 1,000 to 12,000 cargo containers, it will be 18,000 cargo containers or more. We are expecting to complete a feasibility study at the [INSTITUTION] of [PERSON]0, which is currently at 51 feet. These two projects are going to help us continue to build the reputation of the [ORGANIZATION] of GPE49 and [PERSON]0, moving our products throughout the United [PERSON] to [ORGANIZATION]9 quickly and reliably and reaching critical markets. We dont want our shippers to have to pay more because we havent made these infrastructure investments. Moving freight is what we do. This bill is about making it in our waterways as well. Deepening the waterways in the [ORGANIZATION] in GPE49 and [PERSON]0 will ensure they can compete with Canadian ports. It will help us to continue to grow our jobs in the maritime sector, and it will help us to continue to be a gateway from North [PERSON]1 to [ORGANIZATION]9 and around the world. This legislation also helps us in restoring waters adjacent to LOC21 and helps us with our salmon recovery efforts. For the last 18 [ORGANIZATION]3s, [ORGANIZATION]4 Adjacent Waters Restoration Program has focused on protecting and restoring habitat within [ORGANIZATION]4 Basin. Using this program, the [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 was able to work with places like the city of [PERSON]2 to remove a seawall on the LOC23 shoreline. Now that shoreline is a habitat for endangered salmon and the home to [PERSON] and osprey, and it is attracting visitors to the park. The [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 was also able to use the program to work with [PERSON]3 to restore critical habit along [LOCATION]. That was lost in [ORGANIZATION]2. The estuary [LOCATION]54 provides access to spawning, rearing, and feeding areas for salmon. [PERSON] second largest estuary in the United [PERSON]--is home to thousands of species that this bill will also help. Over a dozen of these species are listed as endangered or threatened, and our helping by making these improvements to clean up LOC21 and restore habitat is so important to the viability of the Pacific [ORGANIZATION]6. The bill increases funding for [ORGANIZATION]4 Adjacent Waters Restoration Program from 40 million to 60 million and the per-project funding from 5 million to 10 million. These are just expanded numbers, but they mean everything to meet the goals of the projects around LOC21. We are returning to LOC21 waterways that are unblocked and providing cleaner habitat for salmon--for threatened juvenile salmon--and opportunities in areas like [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] estuary near [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5. Another project will restore tidal flows and create open coastline inlets at the creek originating near FAC15, in [LOCATION]. This will help us to restore spawning habitats for forage fish, support salmon recovery, and improve those shoreline conditions that are so important. These projects are an example of the diversity that our region uses when it helps our ecosystem, k[LOCATION]54n as LOC21, and in helping salmon recovery. This legislation also helps in making sure those who make great improvements to water infrastructure, particularly our hydrosystems, get rewarded for doing that and ensures that they dont wait or hesitate to get that done. This legislation provides an early action provision for licensees on hydrosystems to make improvements and makes sure they will be recognized later. This provision would remove an impediment, and it encourages people to take corrective action sooner rather than later. That is good for our environment, and it is good for taxpayers and helps us save on energy. Most importantly, it does not take away any regulatory oversight from the agency but simply rewards people earlier for doing the right thing. [ORGANIZATION] S6755 I k[LOCATION]54 that FAC16 is a good example of this and will take advantage of this as they plan to rehabilitate units at FAC17 hydro project--a significant investment of over 500 million. This area needs to have these upgrades, and this provision will help them get them done sooner. In this legislation, we are also helping with one of the most challenging things we see in our waterways, and that is protecting the physical infrastructure and waterways in our hydro system from invasive species. The highly invasive [PERSON] and Zebra mussels have invaded our waterways in 20 different [PERSON]. If invasive mussel populations invade the Pacific [ORGANIZATION]6, it is estimated that it could cost our region over 500 million in [ORGANIZATION]3 costs. That would be devoting [STREET] more of our resources just to manage that infestation. LOC28 is the last major uninfected watershed in the United [PERSON], much of it to the credit of watercraft inspection stations on [ORGANIZATION]5. The LOC29 inspection stations help inspect the boats that travel up and down the river for such invasive species, and an inspection of all watercrafts is required. I am pleased that this bill authorizes money specifically for [ORGANIZATION]5 inspection stations. This helps us because, as I said, with a river that hasnt seen these invasive species, the fact that we still do these inspections is critical. Last [ORGANIZATION]3, over 9,000 boats were inspected throughout [ORGANIZATION]7, and because of the funding for [ORGANIZATION]5, these invasive species were kept out of our waters. That means they were kept out not just in [ORGANIZATION]7 but in other parts of the Pacific [ORGANIZATION]6 as well. This legislation also continues the great downpayment on the Drinking Water [ORGANIZATION]6 Revolving Fund, which was created in [ORGANIZATION]4 and has helped our [ORGANIZATION]6--millions of dollars in [ORGANIZATION]3 grants. This is so important. As we saw with the many problems in [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, and other places, many of our colleagues k[LOCATION]54 that this Drinking Water [ORGANIZATION]6 Revolving Fund is necessary for us to keep clean water in the United [PERSON]. These funds helped the city of [PERSON]8 replace its [ORGANIZATION]5 surface water treatment plant and ensured a reliable water supply to the [PERSON]8 community and surrounding area. The funds also helped the city of [PERSON]9 make improvements to its aging water system to ensure that communities have access to a clean water supply. At the end of [ORGANIZATION]2, the city of GPE60 will be celebrating the completion of [ORGANIZATION], which replaced two aging reservoirs that were leaking and that would have failed in the event of a natural disaster in the area. The city was able to complete the project with the help of the Drinking Water [ORGANIZATION]6 Revolving Fund, and I am so glad that is going to help secure more resources for that part of our [ORGANIZATION]6. This also provides [PERSON] and communities with additional financial resources to make investments in their economies for the future, and it also helps to right wrongs from [LOCATION]79. I am pleased that the bill also delivers on an [ORGANIZATION] promise from the [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 to complete the [PERSON] Village Development Plan for four [ORGANIZATION]7 who were displaced when the dams of [ORGANIZATION]5 were constructed. [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], and [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]7 all signed treaties with the [ORGANIZATION] Government in [ORGANIZATION]7, and these treaties reserved the right of the [ORGANIZATION]7 to fish, hunt, and gather at all usual and accustomed fishing places. The [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 and treaty [ORGANIZATION]7 entered into agreements on fishing access. These sites were designed for [ORGANIZATION]8-to-[ORGANIZATION]8 fishing, but out of need and the desire to be close to [ORGANIZATION]5, they have turned into permanent housing. This has resulted in very challenging and unsafe living conditions along the river. I am so glad that my colleague Senator [PERSON]1 and my colleagues from GPE65, Senator [PERSON]2 and Senator [PERSON]3--that we have been able to make it crystal clear to the [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 of Engineers that we need to correct this problem. This bill ensures that those families will get what they were promised [ORGANIZATION]3s ago. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues Senator [PERSON] and Senator [PERSON], as well as the leadership of the [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION], for all the hard work on this bipartisan legislation. When it comes to our waterways, infrastructure investment means jobs. It means the continued protection of clean water, and for us in the [ORGANIZATION]6, it means helping us preserve our salmon populations. I am so happy that we have finally taken another step to strengthen the competitiveness of our ports in the [ORGANIZATION]6. These are real jobs. In the future--near future--with this deepening, we will be able to serve larger cargo container ships, which will help us keep our competitiveness in moving product. While we move about 77 billion worth of products in [ORGANIZATION]7, we move much more than that from all [PERSON] of the United [PERSON], moving through our ports. So while it sounds like an investment in two very large [INSTITUTION] infrastructures on the [ORGANIZATION]7, I guarantee you that it affects many Midwestern [PERSON] and many products and the ability to cost-effectively ship to other parts of the world. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]. Ms. [PERSON]4. Mr. President, before my friend from [ORGANIZATION]7 [ORGANIZATION]6 leaves, I want to thank her for her advocacy on water infrastructure, and I agree with her that this is a great bipartisan bill. The distinguished Senator from [ORGANIZATION]7 [ORGANIZATION]6 mentioned [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, and I just want to thank her one more time. No one stood stronger with me and Senator [PERSON]5 in trying to help the people in [PERSON]6, and I greatly appreciate her help, support, and advocacy. [ORGANIZATION] Mr. President, in addition to praising the water resources bill, which was a great bipartisan effort--there are some wonderful wins in there for [PERSON]--specifically at this moment, I want to speak about my deep regret that DATE80, a very important resolution did not get the bipartisan votes necessary to pass on the [ORGANIZATION]0 floor. That resolution, which failed, would have stopped the administrations short-term plan rule, which is gutting comprehensive healthcare and undermining people with preexisting conditions getting the healthcare they need and deserve. About half the families in [PERSON] have someone in their family with a preexisting condition. It could be anything from high blood pressure, to diabetes, to something like cancer or whatever other illness it might be. They are in a situation [LOCATION]54, with these junk plans, as we call them, where they are going to be undermined, and they either wont be able to get any health insurance, or it will cost much, much more. I have often said that healthcare isnt political it is personal. It is not political. We all care about being able to get the healthcare we need for ourselves, our children, our moms, and our dads. When a family has a child born with a seizure disorder, they arent wondering whom their pediatrician voted for in the last election. When a single mom of two teenagers learns she has breast cancer, she is not concerned about who is up in the polls and who is down in the polls. When a senior is forced to make a decision between buying the medication that helps him breathe better or keeping his heat on, he is not interested in what is happening on ORG70. [ORGANIZATION] isnt political--not to any person I represent or to me or my own family it is personal, and it affects every one of our families, whether we are Democrats, Republicans, urban, rural, red [PERSON], and blue [PERSON]. I wish we could come together and work on ways to provide more healthcare and reduce costs based on that premise--that it is personal, not political. When people tell me their healthcare stories, I can assure you that they dont start with their political affiliation because it doesnt matter they simply want to k[LOCATION]54 that the healthcare they depend on for themselves and their families will be there. That is why I am so concerned about the short-term, limited-duration insurance plans, which we are calling junk plans because that is what they are. They may be cheap, but they dont cover much, if anything, and you dont k[LOCATION]54 until you get sick. Many of them are medically underwritten, meaning [ORGANIZATION] S6756 that insurance companies can charge whatever they like based on the applicants health, their gender, their age, their health status. Remember when being a woman was considered a preexisting condition? I certainly do. These plans are coming back. They are coming back through these junk plans. One recent study found that none of the plans cover maternity care. As a member of ORG71, I led the fight to cover maternity care and birth control services and other preventive services for women. That is pretty basic for the women of this country. And if, as a man, you think you didnt need it, well, just ask your mom whether she did. On top of that, these plans can exclude people with preexisting conditions or impose [ORGANIZATION]3ly or DATE82 caps on care. As I indicated, it is estimated that half of [PERSON] families include someone with a preexisting condition--everything from diabetes, to asthma, to arthritis, to cancer. Under the Affordable Care Act, we didnt have to worry about people with preexisting conditions being covered--until it began to be undermined through these new administrative rules put forward by the administration. [PERSON]6 is a beautiful little [PERSON] girl who was born with half a heart. I was so fortunate to meet her and her parents earlier this [ORGANIZATION]3. [PERSON]6 didnt ask for half a heart. She and her parents didnt do anything to cause it. [PERSON]6 didnt have a choice. She needs comprehensive health insurance. Unfortunately, that kind of insurance is getting less and less affordable. Thanks to short-term plans and other health insurance changes, comprehensive health insurance will cost over 12 percent more [LOCATION]5 in [PERSON] than it would otherwise cost, and it is only getting worse. [PERSON]6 should be able to focus on starting school, growing up, learning to [STREET], going to college, and having a family of her own, not whether she will pay more for insurance, if she can get it, because she was born with a preexisting condition. [PERSON]6 isnt alone. She is just one of the estimated 130 million people in our country with preexisting conditions. That is 130 million people who could be hurt either directly or indirectly by these short- term junk plans. Perhaps you are incredibly lucky, and nobody in your family has a preexisting condition. These short-term policies are a good choice, then, right? Well, just ask [PERSON]7, who came to [ORGANIZATION]8 earlier this [ORGANIZATION]3 to share his story. [PERSON]7 is self-employed. He owns a small landscape design business. In [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]7 was shopping for health insurance. He had been healthy, aside from some back pain. He told his insurance broker that he had been to the chiropractor a number of times and that the chiropractor had taken x rays but had not been able to make a diagnosis for his back pain. The broker assured [PERSON]7 that as long as he didnt have a diagnosis, he would be wasting his money if he bought anything other than a short-term insurance plan. [PERSON]7 took her advice, thinking he was signing up for a quality health insurance plan that would meet his needs. Fast-forward to DATE83 when at DATE84 [PERSON]7 was diagnosed with stage [PERSON]. What he thought was simply back pain turned out to be an aggressive form of blood cancer. After [LOCATION]6 of chemotherapy and radiation, [PERSON]7s cancer was in remission however, his doctors told him that a bone marrow transplant was his only hope for a long-term cure. Then [PERSON]7 heard from his insurance company. They refused to pay for any of his treatment--any of his treatment--even though he had insurance, including the bone marrow transplant, because they claimed the cancer was a preexisting condition even though his broker had told him that was not the case. [PERSON]7 appealed this decision and endured nine additional rounds of chemotherapy to keep his cancer in remission. After DATE85 of waiting--DATE85 of waiting--his appeal was denied. [PERSON]7 was left with no health insurance, no [STREET] to pay for a lifesaving bone marrow transplant and about 800,000 in medical bills, even though he had bought an insurance policy. [PERSON]7 eventually was able to buy some real health insurance--the kind that covers you when you get sick--and get the bone marrow transplant he needed. He is healthy again, thank goodness, but his finances arent. In his words Instead of planning a life together with my girlfriend and a future for my business, I am kept up at [TIME] worrying about staying afloat, how to pay the next bill, how to avoid bankruptcy. This is the story of too many people before the Affordable Care Act passed, requiring comprehensive coverage and requiring people with preexisting conditions to be able to get affordable coverage. As I said before, healthcare isnt political it is personal. People with preexisting conditions deserve to k[LOCATION]54 their insurance will be there when they need it. Families with a sick child deserve to focus on getting her better, not how they are going to pay the bill for the doctor, and small business owners like [PERSON]7 deserve insurance that covers them while they are sick or hurt and doesnt leave them on the verge of bankruptcy. That is what we are talking about. These current plans undermine the capacity for people to be able to get real coverage. They are less expensive, but they dont cover much, if anything, and the problem is you dont k[LOCATION]54 until you get sick. What we need and what everyone needs is the confidence that they are buying affordable insurance that will actually cover them and cover their families. Everyone deserves that kind of insurance. This isnt about politics it is about protecting what is most precious--our families and our health. Unfortunately, because of the administrations actions, we are seeing tremendous rollbacks that are putting more and more power back into the hands of insurance companies that are making their decisions based on what is best for their profits, not what is best for families. I am very disappointed that we werent able to stop that [LOCATION], but I am going to continue to try, as are my Democratic colleagues. We are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that people in the greatest country in the world k[LOCATION]54 they can have affordable healthcare coverage that actually covers their healthcare needs. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [PERSON]. Mr. [PERSON]8. Mr. President, the topic of healthcare affordability should unite us as a common cause. We all need healthcare, whether young or old or male or female, rich or poor. Not one of us will go through life without experiencing a major health concern. Even if we have a clean bill of health [LOCATION], we all face the prospect of accidents, illnesses, and the inherent universal health challenges of aging. The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but it has moved us toward a shared goal of making healthcare more affordable for everyone. Most significantly, the Affordable Care Act prevents insurers from denying coverage or increasing premiums because of a preexisting condition. This critical protection has been widely and wildly popular, and rightly so. If you dont have a preexisting condition, you probably have a family member who does. The Affordable Care Act also requires plans to cover a full set of benefits that enrollees will realistically need over the course of their lives, and, overall, it encourages [PERSON]1ns to get their health insurance so that they will have the appropriate support when they need it the most. I will be the first to recognize that there is room for improvement in our healthcare law, but we need to be working together to fix it, not allowing the [PERSON]5 administration to continue its relentless push to undermine the affordability of healthcare. Since the beginning of his administration, President [PERSON]5 has taken every possible step to weaken consumer protections in health insurance, all the while misinforming the public about what the real impact will be on their DATE86 lives. But [PERSON]1ns right [LOCATION]54 are feeling the impact. For too many hard-working families, health insurance and healthcare costs are still not affordable. To[ORGANIZATION]8, premiums are going up, healthcare prices are soaring, and the burden of cost is increasingly shifted to the patient. We should be focused on ways to strengthen our healthcare system so that it lowers out-of-pocket costs, removes barriers to healthcare, and [ORGANIZATION] S6757 incentivizes cost efficiency. But the flawed [PERSON]5 administration policy the [ORGANIZATION]0 voted on earlier [LOCATION] is a step in the wrong direction. It is a step toward terrible coverage for consumers who will not understand what their plan fails to cover until they need it. We are seeing yet another [PERSON]5 administration effort to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act that are actually working every [ORGANIZATION]8 to help [PERSON]1ns. President [PERSON]5 is creating a new loophole for some insurers to ignore [ORGANIZATION] central patient protections. This is moving us back toward a period where insurance companies could discriminate against [PERSON]1ns based on their conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, arthritis, and even pregnancy-- yes, even pregnancy. Millions of [PERSON]ders rely on [ORGANIZATION] safeguards for preexisting condition coverage. [PERSON]1ns should have the power to choose their own healthcare, but unfortunately this administration has it backward. President [PERSON]5 wants to give more power to insurers to not only choose who they cover but also what they cover. [ORGANIZATION] 10 essential healthcare benefits are truly just that they are indeed essential. The list includes things like prescription drugs, hospitalizations, and preventive care. Before the Affordable Care Act, we saw insurance companies neglect to cover services like maternity care, substance abuse disorder treatment, and mental health care. These are all truly essential elements of any true plan. The [PERSON]5 administration is allowing for risky plans that make insurance companies money while shifting costs to taxpayers and [PERSON]ders who choose to cover these essential health benefits. The [PERSON]5 policy will create a parallel market that targets only relatively healthy, less costly individuals, and that is why I am deeply disappointed by [LOCATION]s vote and the actions of this administration. The true message President [PERSON]5 is sending to the public is that he wants you to be misinformed. He wants you to make bad decisions and buy these flawed plans, increasing the profits of insurers. [PERSON]1n taxpayers will be left with the bill when patients find out that their insurance and all of the money they have put into that insurance over so many [ORGANIZATION]3s simply does not cover their healthcare needs when they need it the most. No matter where you live, how much money you make, or what your health record looks like, no one should be forced to make the impossible choice between seeking medical assistance or paying the bills for other basic necessities. Regardless of what the health condition is or when it arises, all [PERSON]1ns deserve certainty that their decision to go to a doctor will not push them into bankruptcy. Lets be clear that any Member who voted to support the [PERSON]5 administrations efforts to undermine the [ORGANIZATION] casts a vote [LOCATION] against coverage protections for preexisting conditions and against affordable, quality healthcare for all [PERSON]1n families. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from GPE68. Ms. [PERSON]9. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise [LOCATION] to share the story of one of my friends, PERSON90. PERSON91 and her husband own and operate one of ORG73 most successful small businesses--ORG74. They are also the proud parents of a beautiful baby boy. PERSON91, her family, and their business are doing great. But when I met PERSON91 last [ORGANIZATION]3, she told me her path to this point in life had not been easy. In [PERSON]3, PERSON91 left her job at a large firm--and the health insurance it provided--to pursue her dream of starting a brewery with her husband PERSON92. About 1 [ORGANIZATION]3 later, she learned that she was pregnant. During a routine checkup [PERSON]5 before her due date, PERSON91s midwife advised her to see an [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON91 didnt feel sick, so she hesitated, but the midwife urged her to go see a specialist anyway. Midway through her visit, the [ORGANIZATION] became concerned that PERSON91s life was in danger. He diagnosed her with [LOCATION] and rushed her to the hospital. PERSON91s son was born [TIME] via emergency C-section. The doctors who delivered her baby agreed that had PERSON91 waited even [TIME] to see an [ORGANIZATION], both she and her son would have died. In no uncertain terms, PERSON91 told me that she and her son owe their lives to the Affordable Care Act. Without the affordable coverage having been purchased on the Silver [ORGANIZATION]6 Health Insurance Exchange, PERSON91 would not have been able to have seen a specialist, and she and her husband, certainly, would not have been able to have afforded the 1 million in medical costs PERSON91s son incurred over the course of a DATE85-long stay in the [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON91s son is [LOCATION]54 a happy, thriving toddler, but he has a medical issue that interferes with his growth. PERSON91 and PERSON92, her husband, fear that President [PERSON]5s efforts to roll back protections for people with preexisting conditions will make it impossible for them to afford their sons health insurance. [PERSON] [PERSON]5 has not yet been able to get the support in [ORGANIZATION] he needs in order to repeal protections for people with preexisting conditions, but he has taken steps to circumvent the wheel of [ORGANIZATION] and hack away at these protections bit by bit. In [PERSON]7, he signed an Executive order to expand access to what are called junk plans. These are health insurance plans that dont cover essential services like prescription drugs, emergency room visits, or maternity care. These plans are designed for short-term use only and dont include protections for people with preexisting conditions. That means, if you sign up for one of these plans and are a cancer survivor or are a pregnant woman or are a war veteran, you could be charged a higher rate. It also means you could be forced to pay tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket for the care you receive in an emergency. Junk plans come in all shapes and sizes, but none of them comply with consumer protections established by the Affordable Care Act. ORG76 looked at junk plans in 45 [PERSON] and found that 43 percent did not include coverage for mental health services, that 71 percent did not cover outpatient prescription drugs, and that not a single one covered maternity care. Junk plans appear to be cheaper than comprehensive health insurance plans--that is, until you read the fine print. Junk plans have low [PERSON]8 premiums and astronomical out-of-pocket costs. President [PERSON]5s Executive order allows insurance companies to trick consumers into signing up for these plans. Consumers think they are getting a good deal, only to find out, as soon as they get sick, that their medical bills are not covered. The [PERSON]1n Cancer Society Cancer Action Network says junk plans pose a serious threat to cancer patients ability to access quality, affordable health coverage. It also says the present administrations rule will likely leave older and sicker [PERSON]1ns in the individual insurance marketplace, with few, if any, affordable health coverage choices and that patients who are living with serious conditions will be left paying more for the coverage they need if they can afford coverage at all. President [PERSON]5s Executive order to expand access to junk plans is not just an attack on our healthcare system, it is an attempt to send us back to [ORGANIZATION]8s when families like PERSON91s could not afford the healthcare they needed. PERSON91 told me she owes her life to the health insurance she purchased through the [ORGANIZATION]. Where would PERSON91 and her family be without it? What if she had not been able to afford a comprehensive plan? What if she had purchased a junk plan instead? There are 1.2 million GPE68ns who live with preexisting conditions. That is nearly one in two. That number includes nearly 159,000 children and nearly 270,000 people who are nearing retirement. The junk plans rule directly threatens their healthcare. PERSON96, who is the executive director of the Silver [ORGANIZATION]6 Health Insurance Exchange, summed up the risk junk plans pose. She said Junk plans are designed to basically take your preexisting condition and charge you more or tell you that you cant be on those plans at all. [ORGANIZATION] S6758 She continued If they find that youve not disclosed a preexisting medical condition . . . then youre left high and dry with no insurance. I dont want to go back to a world where GPE68ns with preexisting conditions cant get the care they need or where insurance companies arent required to cover basic services like maternity care. I was a proud cosponsor of Senator PERSON97 resolution to overturn President [PERSON]5s Executive order. In failing to pass this resolution, the [ORGANIZATION]0 [ORGANIZATION]0 has done a profound disservice to families and communities all across the country. I will continue fighting to restore protections against junk plans, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from GPE69. Economy Mr. PERSON98. Mr. President, 2 [ORGANIZATION]3s ago, when Republicans took control of the White [ORGANIZATION]1 as well as of [ORGANIZATION], we promised the [PERSON]1n people that growing the economy was going to be our No. 1 priority, and we got right to work. Under the PERSON99 administration, [PERSON]1n workers and businesses faced a lot of obstacles, including burdensome regulations and an outdated Tax Code that acted as a drag on economic growth, so we immediately focused on removing burdensome regulations. Then we focused on developing a historic, comprehensive reform of our Tax Code, which was signed into law [LOCATION]01. Now, the Tax Code isnt necessarily the first thing people think of when they think of economic growth, but the Tax Code has a huge impact on our economy. It helps to determine how much money individuals and families have to spend and save. It helps to determine whether a small business can expand and hire. A small business owner who faces a huge tax bill is highly unlikely to be able to expand her business or hire a new employee. The Tax Code helps to determine whether large businesses hire, grow, and invest in the United [PERSON]. A large business is going to find it pretty hard to create jobs or improve benefits for employees if it is struggling to stay competitive against foreign businesses that pay much less in taxes. A large business is also unlikely to keep jobs and investment in the United [PERSON] if the Tax Code makes it vastly more expensive to hire [PERSON]1n workers. Prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act [LOCATION]01, our Tax Code was not helping our economy or [PERSON]1n families. It was doing just the opposite so we took action. We cut tax rates for [PERSON]1n families, doubled the child tax credit, and nearly doubled the standard deduction. We lowered tax rates across the board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We lowered our ORG9 massive corporate tax rate, which, up until [LOCATION]02, was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We expanded business owners ability to recover the cost of investments they make in their businesses, which frees up cash that they can reinvest in their operations and their workers, and we brought the [ORGANIZATION]0 international tax system into [LOCATION]03 so [PERSON]1n businesses would not be operating at a competitive disadvantage next to their foreign counterparts. Now we are seeing the results. The economy is thriving. Our economy grew at a robust 4.2 percent in [DATE] of this [ORGANIZATION]3. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since [LOCATION]05--almost 50 [ORGANIZATION]3s ago. Think about that. In other words, it has been almost 50 [ORGANIZATION]3s since the last time unemployment was at this low level. More than 1.8 million jobs have been created since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Wages are growing at the best rate in [ORGANIZATION]3s, and incomes are up 4.2 percent. Businesses are bringing money back into the United [PERSON], and business investment is up--from an average of 1.8 percent before the [ORGANIZATION] election to an average of 10 percent so far this [ORGANIZATION]3. Small business optimism is at historic levels. Consumer confidence is at an 18-[ORGANIZATION]3 high. The list goes on. Those are a lot of stats, but they basically boil down to one thing that is, that life is getting better for [PERSON]1n families. Incomes are growing, and families have access to more jobs and opportunities and better benefits. That means fewer families have to live paycheck to paycheck, that an unexpected car repair or doctor bill is less devastating, that it is easier to afford that family vacation or the fees for piano lessons, and that more families have money to save for their kids college or for their retirement. That was the goal--getting the economy thriving again so [PERSON]1n families can thrive. I am proud to say, we are succeeding. I am proud that our policies are making life better for [PERSON]1n families. Yet we are not stopping there. We are going to keep working to secure the gains we have made for the long term and make sure every [PERSON]1n has access to a future of security and opportunity. Tribute to [PERSON]00 Mr. President, I want to take a brief moment to express my gratitude to the ORG80 chairman, Senator [PERSON]00, for his leadership over [LOCATION]79 DATE85 as we worked to confirm Judge--[LOCATION]54 [ORGANIZATION]--[PERSON]. Every [ORGANIZATION]3 confirmation process is a somewhat arduous affair, but Chairman [PERSON]01 had to contend with more than an increased workload. He had to contend with Democratic colleagues who did everything they could to delay and disrupt the process and to taint [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]s confirmation. Yet no matter what tactics the Democrats resorted to, from interrupting the confirmation hearing to withholding critical information, Chairman [PERSON]01 stayed above the fray. He carried on with what needed to be done, whether that was compiling information from [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]s time in the White [ORGANIZATION]1 or interviewing witnesses. He made sure the entire confirmation process was thorough and fair, and he ensured that Dr. [PERSON]03 and [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] were treated with dignity and respect. I am grateful we had him at the helm of the ORG80 during this process, and I am grateful that, once again, he helped to put an outstandingly qualified [ORGANIZATION] on the [ORGANIZATION]3. Tribute to [PERSON]04 Mr. President, I also want to take just [TIME] to recognize the outstanding work that [PERSON]04 has done as the [ORGANIZATION]0 Ambassador to the [ORGANIZATION]. Ambassador [PERSON]05 has been a terrific ambassador and a real leader on the Presidents foreign policy team. She has been a clear, unequivocal voice for the principles our country values, and she has been a tough and outspoken critic of the tyrannical regimes that threaten our country and the free world. I am sure the President will choose an excellent replacement, but [PERSON]04 will be a tough act to follow. I wish her all the best as she begins her next chapter. She will be missed. I yield the floor. Mr. [PERSON]06. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]06. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]07. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. [PERSON]06. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, the Senator from GPE70, Senator [PERSON]08, be recognized. She will be picking up at the end of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Climate Change Mr. [PERSON]06. Mr. President, it is a real pleasure to be joined here [LOCATION] on the [ORGANIZATION]0 floor by Senator [PERSON] [PERSON]08 of GPE70. Senator [PERSON]08 has been a tireless advocate for clean energy and is the [ORGANIZATION]0s bipartisan champion on energy efficiency, alongside Senator [PERSON]10. [ORGANIZATION] released a major warning [ORGANIZATION]6. Ninety-one authors and editors from 40 countries reviewed more than 6,000 scientific papers to assess what it would take to hold global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The report says that we will need to invest roughly five times what we do [LOCATION]54 in low- [ORGANIZATION] S6759 carbon energy and energy efficiency by [LOCATION]10. The [PERSON]08-[PERSON]10 energy efficiency legislation would help move us toward that target. The [PERSON]1n Council for an [ORGANIZATION] says that the bill would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 650 million metric tons over a 15-[ORGANIZATION]3 period. The cumulative net savings from the bill would reach nearly 100 billion. My [ORGANIZATION]6 of GPE71 is a national leader in promoting energy efficiency, so we k[LOCATION]54 how good programs like the [PERSON]08-[PERSON]10 reforms are for consumers, for businesses, and for the environment. GPE71 has consistently ranked among the top [PERSON] for energy efficiency. This [ORGANIZATION]3, we are in the top three on the [ORGANIZATION]6 Energy Efficiency Scorecard. To keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the ORG86 tells us we need renewables to grow to about half of the worlds energy mix by [LOCATION]13 and to perhaps 80 percent of the worlds energy mix by [LOCATION]14. Coal in the global electricity mix needs to be mostly phased out by [LOCATION]10. The fossil fuel industrys front groups, of which there is a considerable legion, tell us that this will raise costs on consumers, but renewables are [LOCATION]54 beating fossil fuel power on cost, and renewable costs are still [LOCATION]53ing. In a recent report on global energy trends, ORG87 notes [ORGANIZATION] and wind power recently crossed a new threshold. . . . Already among the cheapest energy sources globally, solar and wind have much further to go. The ORG87 report shows the top solar [PERSON] here in yellow, the top wind [PERSON] here in blue, and these two--GPE72 and GPE73--are in green because they are leaders in both wind and solar. If you look at the top 20 [ORGANIZATION]0 solar and wind [PERSON], three-quarters of those [PERSON] have electricity prices below the national average, so clearly renewables dont hurt energy costs. By the [STREET], these [PERSON] include some of the reddest politically, including GPE74, GPE75, [ORGANIZATION], GPE78, and GPE72. The cost transition with renewables coming down through the price of fossil fuel is showing up in [ORGANIZATION]0 solar projects purchased-power agreements. You can see in this chart from [LOCATION] that over time, solar generation costs have come down in line with new-built natural gas generation. That is what this band is. This is the price for new-built natural gas generation. This dot here represents a new project by ORG89 to sell power to the southern [ORGANIZATION] utility, ORG90, from a 100-megawatt solar array with an accompanying 30-megawatt energy storage system for 45 per megawatt hour, right in line with new natural gas plants. One industry analyst suggested that this facility effectively took the [STREET] of a peak-demand gas plant. Defenders of old, dirty energy sources paint renewables as unreliable, as intermittent, but ORG87s report finds that renewables have actually proven to strengthen grid resilience and reliability. Integrating renewable capacity into the grid has gone well in practice, and [ORGANIZATION] analyses predict increased renewable uses to improve grid security and resiliency. The grid operator in GPE78, the most heavily wind-powered [ORGANIZATION]6, figured out a while ago the algorithms to treat wind across its grid as baseload. When you pair wind or solar projects with battery storage, like that ORG92 project, then individual renewable projects become baseload power sources. You dont have to aggregate and run algorithms that is a new baseload source. The transition involves batteries, and batteries are booming. [ORGANIZATION] projects worldwide storage capacity currently around [TIME] to grow tenfold, to at least 65 gigawatt hours by [LOCATION]15 [LOCATION]15 is right around the corner--a tenfold growth. Costs are [LOCATION]53ing fast. Lithium-ion batteries are down in price 80 percent since [LOCATION]16, just in these 7 [ORGANIZATION]3s. That is an 80-percent drop in price. Regulators are adapting. The [ORGANIZATION] Energy Regulatory Commission just finalized a new rule--a unanimous and bipartisan new rule--for energy storage on [PERSON]1s electric grids. One study has predicted the rule could spur 50 gigawatts of additional energy storage across the United [PERSON], enough to power roughly 35 million homes. Energy storage is actually coming to market already. The Colorado [ORGANIZATION]6 Public Utility Commission just unanimously approved ORG96 to build 2.5 billion in renewable energy and battery storage, to retire 660 megawatts of coal-fired power, shutting down ongoing plants for cheaper, new renewable battery combinations. The request for bids didnt just smoke out this one bid it brought out a flood of renewable energy proposals at costs that beat out existing coal and natural gas facilities. The ORG86 warning was particularly serious and specific about the urgent choices before us, and we, too, need to be serious about a new direction to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. Renewable energy and energy efficiency are our pathways in that direction, along with a new technology--trapping carbon emissions to use or store them, even pulling carbon dioxide straight from the air. These carbon-captured technologies have been starved without revenue because of a failure in energy market economics, which is that there is no revenue proposition for capturing carbon pollution. Which brings me to the Nobel Prize in economics just won by [PERSON][DATE] of [PERSON]. [PERSON]12 aligns with the well-established market economics that polluters should pay for damage to the environment and to public health. That is econ [DATE]. Without that, the price signal, which is at the heart of market economics, is off, and subsidies result. The market fails. And when ORG98 estimates the fossil fuel subsidy at 700 billion per [ORGANIZATION]3 just in the United [PERSON], that is a massive market failure. [PERSON]12 recommends that we correct the enormous market failure which the fossil fuel industry [LOCATION]54 so busily protects politically. There is basically no alternative to a market solution, [PERSON]12 said in response to the Nobel Prize award. The incentives, he said, are market prices--to raise the price of goods and services that are carbon intensive and lower the ones that are less carbon intensive. The science on this, as I think most of us understand, is firmly established, and the economics are widely understood. It is the politics that keep getting in the [STREET]--the fossil fuel industry dark money politics. This is the last frontier of climate change, said [PERSON]12. I think we understand the science, he said. I think we understand the economics of abatement, he said. He said We understand pretty much the damages. But we dont understand how to bring countries together. That is where the real frontier work is going on [LOCATION]. [PERSON]1 should be leading at this frontier, not lagging. Lost in our fossil fuel politics, we are failing in leadership. History will not be kind with our failure. It is well past time for [ORGANIZATION] to wake up. Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from GPE70, saluting her once again for the leadership that I remarked on at the beginning of my remarks in working with Senator [PERSON]10 to be the [ORGANIZATION]0s bipartisan leader on energy efficiency. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from GPE70. Mrs. [PERSON]13. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator [PERSON]14, not just for those kind words but for all of the work he has done and continues to do. For the last 6 [ORGANIZATION]3s, Senator [PERSON]14 has come to the floor of this [ORGANIZATION]0 [LOCATION]19 after [LOCATION]19, every [LOCATION]19, to talk about climate change and to talk about its effects throughout the United [PERSON] and around the globe and our need to take action to address this crisis. Thank you very much, Senator [PERSON]14, for your leadership. Climate change is real, and it is a present threat to our planet. Senator [PERSON]14 talked about some of the science involved with that. It is very clear to anybody who has looked at the science who doesnt have a political agenda that this is real. It is a threat, and we need to address it. In GPE70, we are already seeing the impacts of climate change in so many ways. Rising temperatures [ORGANIZATION] S6760 are shortening our [LOCATION]21, they are disrupting our maple syrup production, and they are shortening [LOCATION]22 and our s[LOCATION]54mobiling. Ice-out occurs earlier [PERSON] on our lakes. They are causing sea level rise that can imperil businesses and homes along our seacoast. The strains on our fisheries and the increases of insect-borne diseases that endanger our wildlife can all be tied to the effects of climate change. I have here a photo that I think it is important for people to see. Moose have been one of GPE70s iconic wildlife representatives, to put it, I guess, the easiest [STREET]. The moose are something that we are very proud of in GPE70. We have seen them in the wildest parts of our [ORGANIZATION]6, some even as far south as where I live in southern GPE70. What we are seeing as the result of climate change is a 40-percent reduction in the moose in GPE70. As I said, that is happening because of increases in insect-borne diseases. If we look very closely at this picture, it looks like there are little round balls on this moose. Those are ticks. Those are ticks that have been able to attach to the moose and, in so many cases, kill the moose. They are there because it is not getting cold enough in [LOCATION]24 to kill off those ticks, so they multiply in such numbers that they attach to the moose and they kill them. You can see this is a distressed moose that has been affected by those ticks. She shouldnt look like this, but it is the ticks. Those insect-borne diseases are also responsible for something called brain worm that affects moose as well. So for our hunters and the people who enjoy the outdoors and wildlife viewing, that is being threatened [LOCATION]54 because of climate change. The beautiful maples that produce maple syrup and that produce such beautiful colors in our [LOCATION]53 foliage are being threatened because of climate change. The estimate is that in several [ORGANIZATION]8, we will no longer see either moose or maple trees in GPE70 because they will have been forced out because the warming temperatures will mean they can no longer survive. Climate change is also affecting the public health of GPE70 citizens. Rising temperatures increase smog levels. They heighten the effects of [LOCATION]26. They increase the number of children with asthma. GPE70 has one of the highest childhood asthma rates in the country, and that has gotten worse because of climate change. Scientists have proven without a doubt that CO2 and other greenhouse gases are the primary culprits for the climate changes that we are seeing and that human activity has increased the concentration of these greenhouse gases. If we are going to stop global warming, the United [PERSON] must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in every sector, starting with how we produce and consume energy. One of the things that I have learned since my [ORGANIZATION]8s as Governor is that the easiest, fastest [STREET] to reduce our energy use is through energy efficiency. It is without a doubt [PERSON]1s largest energy resource. It has contributed more to our ORG9 energy needs over the last 40 [ORGANIZATION]3s than any other fuel source. Without the economy-wide improvements in energy efficiency that have occurred since [LOCATION]29, it is estimated that [LOCATION]s economy would require 60 percent more energy than we are [LOCATION]54 consuming. In fact, savings from energy efficiency improvements over the last 40 [ORGANIZATION]3s have reduced our national energy bill by an estimated 800 billion--with a b--all while growing and expanding our economy. Put another [STREET], in the last 40 [ORGANIZATION]3s, we have saved more energy through energy efficiency than we have produced through fossil fuels and nuclear power combined. So think about that. Think about the potential of energy efficiency in addressing our energy needs. Energy efficiency is also the largest sector within the [ORGANIZATION]0 clean energy economy. It employs nearly 2.25 million [PERSON]1ns nationwide, and the majority of those people work in our small businesses. We k[LOCATION]54 that small businesses create about two-thirds of the new jobs in this country. They are overwhelmingly responsible for innovation. Sixteen times more patents are produced by small businesses. So this is where innovation is going on, and it is going on in energy efficiency. Just to reiterate, energy efficiency measures have proven time and time again to be the easiest and most cost-effective [STREET] to address climate change, while reducing energy costs and creating private sector jobs. The thing that I like about energy efficiency is that you dont have to live in a certain part of the country and you dont have to be a proponent of other types of fuel sources to appreciate and to support energy efficiency. Everyone benefits from energy efficiency. Unfortunately, since he took office, President [PERSON]5 and his administration have proposed policies that seek to undermine [PERSON]1s clean energy economy and delay our progress toward addressing climate change. The administration has proposed rollbacks to clean car standards that will force [PERSON]1ns to pay more at the gas pump and harm our environment. Here is a chart that shows very clearly what rolling back [PERSON] standards--the vehicle emissions requirements--would do. By [LOCATION]30, the rollback would add at least 158 million metric tons of carbon dioxide [ORGANIZATION]3ly. It would increase [ORGANIZATION]0 fuel consumption by 13.9 billion gallons per [ORGANIZATION]3. This is according to the [PERSON]1n Council for an [ORGANIZATION]. If we think about that in terms of fossil fuels--this fuel consumption--that is more fuel than we import from [ORGANIZATION] or GPE82 [PERSON]. Think about what that will mean for increased consumption. The administration has also proposed to replace the Clean Power Plan with regulations that would relax standards for powerplants at the expense and well-being of current and future generations. Appliance efficiency standards have been frozen in [STREET]. After four [ORGANIZATION]8 with energy efficiency as a bipartisan cornerstone of [ORGANIZATION] energy policy, the President has once again proposed profound cuts to energy efficiency and to renewable energy programs at [ORGANIZATION]00. For those of us who support energy efficiency, there can be only one response to these rollbacks We must address them head-on, and we must redouble our efforts to keep [PERSON]1 on the right track. As a result of bipartisan efforts in the [ORGANIZATION]1 and [ORGANIZATION]0--as I said, energy efficiency is one thing that we can get behind, Republicans and Democrats--[LOCATION]33 the President signed into law a spending bill that includes increased investments for clean energy programs at [ORGANIZATION]00--something that has enjoyed strong bipartisan support. In addition to increasing those investments, this appropriations bill marks the first time since [LOCATION]34--so the first time since I have been in the [ORGANIZATION]0--that [ORGANIZATION]00 will secure its funding before the start of a fiscal [ORGANIZATION]3. This financial certainty will strengthen these programs and the industries they support. The passage of [ORGANIZATION] appropriations bill that we did [LOCATION] demonstrates that [ORGANIZATION] remains committed to advancing commonsense, bipartisan policies that will strengthen our ORG9 energy efficiency. Just [ORGANIZATION]6, this [ORGANIZATION]0 adopted a bipartisan resolution that was sponsored by Senator [PERSON]10 of [LOCATION] and me, along with 19 of our colleagues, that recognizes the economic and environmental benefits that energy efficiency has contributed to this country. Senator [PERSON]10 and I are also committed to advancing our legislation to spur energy efficiency innovation and other initiatives across the most energy- intensive sectors of our economy. Senator [PERSON]14 talked about the efforts that we have engaged in over the last 7 [ORGANIZATION]3s. We have introduced our bill into [ORGANIZATION] in each [ORGANIZATION] over [LOCATION]79 7 [ORGANIZATION]3s. Each time, we are getting a little more momentum in getting this through. We have gotten certain provisions of the bill through in [DATE] [ORGANIZATION]es. It has been far too long since [ORGANIZATION] passed a comprehensive energy bill, so it is time for us to work together to pass an energy bill that includes energy efficiency. This is bipartisan legislation. If it were brought to the floor [LOCATION], I guarantee you it would pass overwhelmingly, and it would improve our ORG9 energy policies and help to grow the economy. [ORGANIZATION] S6761 We have some great examples of what is being done, and Senator [PERSON]14 talked about some of what is being done around the country to address energy efficiency and reduce our energy use. GPE70, like GPE71, is one of the [PERSON] that are part of [ORGANIZATION]02. At the [ORGANIZATION]6, local, and grassroots levels, individuals, businesses, and governments are rising to the challenge by intensifying their efforts to advance energy efficiency and clean energy. This chart shows what has happened in the [PERSON] that have been part of [ORGANIZATION]02. Carbon pollution has gone down 51 percent, and electricity prices are down 6.4 percent. For us in [ORGANIZATION], where we have very high energy costs, that is very positive. So if you dont support energy efficiency for any other reason, you should support it because it reduces costs. Look at how much in energy savings to consumers 773 million. Since [LOCATION]34, the nine [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION]02 have outperformed the national average in terms of all of these measures. Because the majority of proceeds are invested in energy efficiency, they have allowed electricity prices to [LOCATION]53, and they have saved consumers millions on their energy bills. As we look in the out[ORGANIZATION]3s, billions more are expected in savings, thanks to those investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy under [ORGANIZATION]02. In [PERSON]7 of DATE83, RGGIs nine [PERSON] agreed to strengthen their program by reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least 30 percent more by [LOCATION]13. GPE70 and other RGGI [PERSON] have shown the GPE84 that [PERSON] can make smart clean energy choices that benefit the environment while strengthening the economy. For those who say we need a market- driven approach to addressing climate change, this is a perfect example of that. Climate change represents an enormous challenge, but solutions are within reach if we put into [STREET] policies that will allow for swift action. We have a responsibility to help protect our children and grandchildren from the severe consequences of global warming. We have to start [LOCATION]54, and we have to start with energy efficiency. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note that my allergies are a result of that climate change. Mr. [PERSON]06. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SULLIGPE47N. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to [PERSON]16 Mr. SULLIGPE47N. Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer k[LOCATION]54s, I have been coming down here nearly every [LOCATION]19--usually Wednes[ORGANIZATION]8 or Thurs[ORGANIZATION]8--for the last 2 [ORGANIZATION]3s to talk about somebody who is making a big difference in my [ORGANIZATION]6, the great [ORGANIZATION]6 of GPE7. I call this person our [LOCATION] of [LOCATION]45. Most of the people who visit GPE7 do so in [LOCATION]46--I was honored the Presiding Officer and his family came up to visit [LOCATION]47--and we k[LOCATION]54 that is understandable, to come up when the [ORGANIZATION] is high in the sky, but this time of [ORGANIZATION]3 is truly magnificent in my great [ORGANIZATION]6. To borrow a phrase that is no doubt familiar to many, including some of the pages [LOCATION]48 is coming. [LOCATION]48 is coming. Every [ORGANIZATION]8, the [ORGANIZATION] comes up later and sets earlier. S[LOCATION]54 is already on the ground in some places in GPE7. In some places in the [ORGANIZATION]6, the mountains are dusted--termination dust, we call it--and that dust is quickly turning into deep s[LOCATION]54 and making its [STREET] down the mountains. It will not be long before it spreads out all throughout our communities in [LOCATION] and other cities. The whole [ORGANIZATION]6 is crackling with energy to get ready for [LOCATION]50, like we do every [ORGANIZATION]3. For some, though--particularly for the hungry and the homeless-- [LOCATION]51 in GPE7 can be incredibly difficult and incredibly challenging. Actually, as we all k[LOCATION]54 here, for the hungry and the homeless any time of [LOCATION]7 can be incredibly difficult and challenging. In [LOCATION], there is a [STREET] where everyone, no matter who you are, is greeted with dignity, respect, and a hot meal. The [STREET] is called [ORGANIZATION]03, and the person who makes sure it all happens and comes together is [PERSON]16, the executive director of [ORGANIZATION]03, and [PERSON]17 is our [LOCATION] of [LOCATION]45. Let me tell you a little bit about [PERSON]17. She was born in [LOCATION] and moved to the [ORGANIZATION]7 with her parents when she was a young teenager. When she graduated from [ORGANIZATION]04 with a degree in communications and political science, she was on her [STREET] back home to GPE7. GPE7 always calls you when you leave it, she said. Its always the [STREET] that feels most like home. She worked at a local bank and the [LOCATION] Convention and Visitors Center, where she was able to travel all around the country to talk people into visiting our great [ORGANIZATION]6, particularly in [LOCATION]52 like [LOCATION]53, like [LOCATION]54. Then her husbands job took them to LOC31, where they stayed for some time, but, once again, GPE7 beckoned, and they returned. Shortly after coming back home again, [PERSON]17 saw an ad to help run [ORGANIZATION]03, and she knew she had to go for it. She knew that passion was in her heart. The fact that it is completely local and completely community supported was a huge lure to her, she said but so was helping and working with the homeless throughout the [ORGANIZATION]6. [PERSON]17s uncle, for example, was a [LOCATION] veteran with mental health challenges after serving in [LOCATION]. For [ORGANIZATION]8, he lived on the streets in GPE49. She saw the pain that her uncles homelessness caused her mom and the rest of the family, and of course her uncle, but then he got help at a [STREET] like [ORGANIZATION]03, and she also saw the positive impact that not only had on her uncle but the entire family, the entire community. [ORGANIZATION]06 is an [LOCATION] institution. It serves breakfast and lunch every [ORGANIZATION]8--about 950 meals a [ORGANIZATION]8--to the hungry and the homeless. This requires the work of about 120 volunteers a [ORGANIZATION]8. People from all across the community come to help out. On any given [ORGANIZATION]8, you will see a business executive, maybe a pastor, a construction worker, politicians--so many, from all walks of life--serving food to the homeless and hungry. We have also seen the recipients of that generosity of food volunteering themselves, all of them--such a supportive community--working together to help one another. [ORGANIZATION]06 is so much more than a [STREET] for a meal. It serves as a mailing address for their clients. It is a [STREET] where you can call a loved one, a [STREET] to get some dry socks, a hat and a coat, warm clothing for the cold [LOCATION]51. You can get help with your GPE47 benefits. You can get help finding a job or it is a [STREET] to get out from the cold for [TIME]. [PERSON]17 said [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]8 that someone walks into [ORGANIZATION]03 is the worst [ORGANIZATION]8 of that persons life. And were there to greet them with compassion and respect. [PERSON]17 has also expanded the program to include a very popular program [LOCATION]54 in [LOCATION] called [ORGANIZATION]07, which provides after- school and [LOCATION]19end meals for children. All told, between the meals served at [ORGANIZATION]06 and for the [ORGANIZATION]07, under [PERSON]17s guidance, leadership, and passion, more than 700,000 meals were served last [ORGANIZATION]3. [PERSON]17 loves her job. She loves how supportive the community is. She loves watching people grow and helping them get the help they need--and then their coming back to help others. She said Were all very fortunate here. We get to help people, which is a passion. Not everybody can say that. [PERSON]17s work extends far beyond [ORGANIZATION]03 and the [ORGANIZATION]07. She is also very involved in [LOCATION] recovery community-- recovery from addiction, particularly in [LOCATION]79 few [ORGANIZATION]3s. [LOCATION], GPE86, like the rest of the community, isnt immune to what is happening all across the country with regard to the opioid and heroin crisis. The good news is, we are working in the [ORGANIZATION]0 and in the [ORGANIZATION]1 on this issue. We just passed a bill, a very important bill, that will help [PERSON] and communities address this, but we have a long [STREET] to go. Too many young people--people of all ages--are being lost to us because of this horrible epidemic, and, unfortunately and very tragically, [PERSON]17s son [PERSON]19, 23 [ORGANIZATION]3s old, was one of those we lost. She has put the [ORGANIZATION] the deep pain of losing her son--to good work. She has turned into a fierce advocate for those suffering from addiction. She talks about [PERSON]20 often, wanting people to k[LOCATION]54 that this can happen to anyone. That is why we need to continue to focus. Through her work and the work of so many advocates across the [ORGANIZATION]6, people are finally getting the help they need. [PERSON]17 said The peer mentorship that is going on right [LOCATION]54 is saving lives. So much progress has been made. There are so many people who have really helped to shine a light on the issue. [PERSON]17 is such a force for good in my [ORGANIZATION]6. She has tenacity, grit, courage, and a huge heart. She is doing so many things. For that, we want to thank [PERSON]17 for all she is doing. Congratulations on being our [LOCATION] of [LOCATION]45. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] Mr. [PERSON]21. Mr. President, [LOCATION] in the [ORGANIZATION]0 we were faced with two opportunities to side with cancer patients over insurance companies. In our country, almost everybody would say that we ought to side with the cancer patients over the insurance companies, but the [ORGANIZATION]0 failed again in both cases. Let me explain. To[ORGANIZATION]8, as we considered this, we wanted to make clear whose side we are on. The side the [ORGANIZATION]0 chose, and it looks like the ORG80 chose, is not the side of patients. [TIME], I testified at the ORG80s hearing on the White [ORGANIZATION]1s two nominees to [ORGANIZATION][DATE], [PERSON]22 and [PERSON]23. Both of these men have a troubling record of stripping [LOCATION]ans of their rights, and Mr. [PERSON]24 actions on healthcare are particularly threatening to millions of [PERSON]1ns--not just the 5 million [LOCATION]ans who have preexisting conditions but millions of [PERSON]1ns with preexisting conditions. Five million [LOCATION]ans [LOCATION]62, as I said, have preexisting conditions. That is half the population in my [ORGANIZATION]6. Because of the Affordable Care Act, these [LOCATION]ans can rest a little easier, k[LOCATION]54ing they cant be turned down for health coverage or have their rates skyrocket because their child has asthma or their husband has diabetes or their wife has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Mr. [PERSON]25 is willing to take that peace of mind away and throw those families into financial chaos. [LOCATION]63, he did what three career attorneys with [ORGANIZATION]12 refused to do. He filed a brief challenging the law that protects [PERSON]1ns with preexisting conditions. The next [ORGANIZATION]8, the White [ORGANIZATION]1 appointed him to a [ORGANIZATION] circuit [STREET] judgeship. Filing this brief earned him rebukes from across the legal community. Three attorneys withdrew from the case, and one actually resigned in objection to [ORGANIZATION] unprecedented action. Our Republican [ORGANIZATION]0 colleague from [LOCATION], Mr. [PERSON]26, called the brief as far-fetched as any he has ever heard. Mr. [PERSON]25 had no problem putting his name right at the top and filing it. We should not be putting on the bench for life anyone who puts partisanship ahead of cancer patients or ahead of people with diabetes or ahead of someone with high blood pressure or ahead of [PERSON]1ns healthcare. Unfortunately, the White [ORGANIZATION]1 is also chipping away at the ability of [LOCATION]ans with preexisting conditions to get affordable coverage that actually covers their conditions. Again, we are talking about 5 million [LOCATION]ans, tens of millions of [PERSON]1ns. You can talk about anxiety and autism. You can talk about heart disease or heartburn, cholesterol, stroke, thyroid issues. We are talking about families. We are talking about neighbors. We are talking about some of the people in this body. Everyone here, by the [STREET], takes care of themselves. We all have good health insurance. We dont mind, apparently, denying it to millions of others. Some Senators think it is fine to let insurance companies sell junk to our constituents back home. These insurance policies are just that They are junk. They are insurance until you need the insurance. Allowing insurance companies to sell these plans drives up healthcare for everyone. They weaken protection for anyone with a preexisting condition. Under their new rules, insurance companies could force [PERSON]1ns with preexisting conditions into these junk plans--and junk is the right word--that barely cover anything. They can charge exorbitant, unaffordable rates for a decent plan. Half of my colleagues--exactly half--voted for Senator [PERSON]27 motion. Senator [PERSON]28, from [ORGANIZATION], has been a hero on this. Half of my colleagues--all with health insurance paid for by taxpayers--have told the people Sorry, you are on your own. We are letting the insurance companies do whatever they want--rip you off, hike up your costs. That is the [STREET] it goes. It all comes down to whose side you are on. [PERSON]22, the Presidents nomination for [ORGANIZATION]13, has made it clear He stands with insurance companies, not with cancer patients. The administration has made it clear They stand with insurance companies, not kids with asthma. To[ORGANIZATION]8, the [ORGANIZATION]0 chose to stand with those insurance companies over their constituents who need prescription medicines. Honoring Journalists Mr. President, a free, independent press is critical to our democracy. Reporters do vital work, not just in [ORGANIZATION]7 but around the country. They shine a light on the important issues in our communities. Right [LOCATION]54, that means covering the addiction crisis that grips our country. To[ORGANIZATION]8 alone--if [LOCATION] is an average [ORGANIZATION]8 in [LOCATION], as I assume it is-- [DATE] people will die of an opioid overdose. Yester[ORGANIZATION]8, [DATE] died. [LOCATION]67, [DATE] will die. Fri[ORGANIZATION]8, [DATE] will die. We have been working bipartisanly to help get communities the resources they need. [LOCATION]69 we passed a bipartisan package to fight opioid addiction. It is a start. We need more help from a generally disengaged White [ORGANIZATION]1. We need a [ORGANIZATION]6 government to get out from under its corruption, [ORGANIZATION]8 to [ORGANIZATION]8, that afflicts it and get out and do what they should be doing to fight opioid addiction. Everyone has a role to play. Local journalists do vital work keeping [LOCATION]ans informed of all the resources we have in our [ORGANIZATION]6. That is why, [ORGANIZATION]2, I want to highlight another story in an [LOCATION] paper informing the public, reported by a journalist serving his community. I remind my colleagues that the media are not the enemy of the people, as the White [ORGANIZATION]1 likes to say, but they serve our communities. They live in our communities. They are part of our communities. They fight for our communities. [PERSON]29 reported for [ORGANIZATION]15 about [ORGANIZATION]16, a local addiction and mental health treatment center. [ORGANIZATION]16 is Central [LOCATION]s oldest and most comprehensive treatment center. It has been a great partner to my office in our work, along with Senator [PERSON]10, to help [LOCATION]ans fighting addiction. In my conversations with [ORGANIZATION]16 clients, it is clear what a difference this organization makes in so many lives in Central [LOCATION]. Mr. [PERSON]30 reported on [ORGANIZATION]16s Families in [ORGANIZATION], which provides education, training, and counseling support to families confronted with substance abuse problems. Through its reporting, [ORGANIZATION]15 is raising awareness about this important local resource. This kind of reporting is what journalists do every [ORGANIZATION]8 in every community in GPE87, GPE71, [LOCATION], and across the country. That is why they are deserving of respect. We should reject the out-and-out attacks by the President of the United [PERSON] and others who call journalism and journalists in the media enemies of the people. They serve their readers. They serve their viewers. They serve their communities. They deserve our respect. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from GPE71. GPE88n [PERSON] Mr. [PERSON]31. Mr. President, [LOCATION] I rise to continue my series of speeches on GPE88n hybrid warfare and the threat it poses to our national security. GPE88n hybrid warfare occurs [ORGANIZATION] S6763 below the level of direct military conflict, yet it is no less a threat to our national security and the integrity of our democracy and our society. We must reframe our thinking to understand that these are attacks from a foreign adversary on our democratic institutions, our free markets, and our open society. We recently honored our [LOCATION]53en and observed the attacks of [LOCATION]70. The 9[DATE] Commission Report, which looked into what happened after the attacks, assessed that one of our governments failures in preventing those attacks was a failure of imagination. Now, too, we have the Director of [ORGANIZATION] telling us that the system is blinking red, akin to the threats we received before 9[DATE]. We must be focused on the current problem as a national security threat. This threat requires that the United [PERSON] defend itself against hybrid attacks with the same level of commitment and resolve as we would against a military attack against our country. For far too long, we have failed to recognize that hybrid attacks are the new GPE88n form of warfare. As laid out in the GPE88n GPE84al Security Strategy of [LOCATION]71, the [PERSON]32 approach to conflict includes weaponizing tools and resources from across government and society. The GPE88n strategy states Interrelated political, military, military- technical, diplomatic, economic, informational, and other measures are being developed and implemented in order to ensure strategic deterrence and the prevention of armed conflicts. The GPE88n strategy describes the conventional and nonconventional arenas of warfare as the [ORGANIZATION]19 envisions it and how GPE88 has utilized all of the tools of statecraft to engage an adversary without, in many cases, firing a shot. These different disciplines make up a GPE88n hybrid approach to confrontation below the threshold of direct- armed conflict, a method that has been developing and escalating since the earliest [ORGANIZATION]8s of [PERSON]33 rise to power in GPE88. The main tenets of the [PERSON]32 hybrid operations are these information operations with cyber tools, which people commonly think of as hacking propaganda and disinformation manipulation of social media and malign influence, which can be deployed through political, legal, or financial channels. A further characteristic of GPE88n hybrid warfare is denial and deception used to obscure its involvement. The [ORGANIZATION]19 deploys more than one hybrid warfare tactic simultaneously to provide maximum effect. A look at the GPE88n hybrid warfare doctrine also illuminates that the [ORGANIZATION]19 sees deterrence and prevention differently than we do. This is a critical point. We see deterrence as a [STREET] to avoid conflict. They are not merely using these tactics as deterrence or strategic prevention in the [STREET] we think about these conflicts. Instead, they are deploying these tactics aggressively but below the threshold of where they assess we will respond with conventional weapons. One such example was the hybrid warfare operations the [ORGANIZATION]19 deployed in [LOCATION], including covert forces sometimes referred to as little green men and the use of coercive political tactics, including an illegitimate referendum. Now, previously I have addressed aspects of [ORGANIZATION] hybrid warfare operations against the United [PERSON] dealing with tactics of financial malign influence and multiple hybrid tools they have deployed against our democratic elections. To[ORGANIZATION]8 I will discuss another GPE88n tactic and its hybrid warfare arsenal the use of assassination, politically motivated violence, intimidation, or detention to pursue the [PERSON]32 objectives. These tactics are sometimes referred to as dirty active measures. With dirty active measures, the immediate attack is deployed against an individual who is working counter to the [PERSON]32 strategic goals by challenging [PERSON]33 power base, exposing corruption, or unearthing hybrid warfare operations. But the damage of these hybrid warfare tactics goes well beyond the individual killed, hurt, threatened, or jailed by the [ORGANIZATION]19. These tactics cause chaos, fear, and instability to bystanders and have a deterrent effect, sending a chilling message to others that might seek to challenge the [PERSON]32 rule. Further, the reach with which [PERSON]34 has deployed these weapons inside GPE88, across [LOCATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1, and even in the United [PERSON] instills fear that if the [ORGANIZATION]19 wants to get rid of you, there is [LOCATION]54here to hide. Like all aspects of GPE88n hybrid warfare, dirty active measures are part of a pattern of behavior that serve [ORGANIZATION] strategic interests. [PERSON]33 highest strategic objective is preserving his grip on power. He also seeks to operate unconstrained domestically and in the near abroad. Finally, [PERSON]34 seeks for GPE88 to be seen equal to the United [PERSON] and to regain the great power status it lost at the end of the Cold War. He k[LOCATION]54s he cannot effectively compete with the United [PERSON] in conventional ways and win. Instead, he seeks to use tools from his hybrid warfare arsenal in order to divide us from our allies and partners in the [PERSON] and weaken our democratic societies from within. The [PERSON]34 regime has been engaged in a pattern of dirty active measures for [LOCATION]73, and the tempo has only increased since he retook the Presidency in [PERSON]3. These tactics have increasing implications for the United [PERSON] and allied national security. I want to address this tactic of dirty active measures because it has taken on greater urgency due to recent events. In particular, I am thinking of the poisoning of [PERSON]35, a former GPE88n military intelligence officer, and his daughter on British soil and [PERSON]33 threat against Ambassador [PERSON]36 and other [ORGANIZATION]0 Government officials at the [LOCATION]8 Summit. These events may seem unrelated, but they are actually part of a pattern of malicious and threatening GPE88n behavior. To[ORGANIZATION]8, I will explain the connection and make recommendations for how we can deter and counter [ORGANIZATION] use of dirty active measures as part of its hybrid warfare operations below the level of military conflict. Dirty active measures have a long and sordid history in GPE88 and [PERSON]6, dating back to czarist times. For assassinations, poison was often the weapon of choice, including the attempted cyanide poisoning of [PERSON]37 in [LOCATION]74. In [LOCATION]75, [PERSON]38 opened a poison laboratory to test methods to be used against political enemies named the special room, which was also k[LOCATION]54n as the lab of death. At this lab, they developed the nerve agents k[LOCATION]54n as novichoks, which were designed to be undetectable and were recently deployed against the [PERSON]39. These tactics were amplified under [PERSON]40 and featured killings by hired assassins, staged automobile accidents, and poisonings, used inside GPE88 and deployed abroad. [PERSON]40 notoriously said [PERSON] solves all problems. No man, no problem. Given President [PERSON]33 background as a spy master, it should come as no surprise that [ORGANIZATION] use of dirty active measures have continued under his regime. Before becoming Prime Minister and President, [PERSON]34 spent the majority of his career in the [ORGANIZATION]21, the states security service, and its successor, the [ORGANIZATION]22. As GPE88n journalist [PERSON]41 wrote, the [ORGANIZATION]21s main task was always to protect the interests of whoever currently resided in the [ORGANIZATION]19. In this system, loyalty and fidelity to the state is prized above all, and [PERSON]33 values were shaped by it. In [LOCATION]76, [PERSON]34 lamented that the breakup of [PERSON]6 was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of DATE8. When he assumed power, he resurrected a system that reflected Soviet methods. He employed all of the instruments of the state, including the [ORGANIZATION]24, the courts, and security services, to protect his power base and to allow him to pursue strategic objectives in the foreign arena unconstrained. [PERSON]33 use of hybrid warfare tactics of assassination, political violence, intimidation, and detention--the dirty active measures--are tenets of this system he created to cement his hold on power. [PERSON]34 has also manipulated the [ORGANIZATION]24 and the [STREET] system to make and enforce laws that manufacture legal consent for tactics of dirty active measures. As opposition activist [PERSON]42, who survived being [ORGANIZATION] S6764 twice poisoned, wrote recently in the [ORGANIZATION]7 Post, in [PERSON] [PERSON]33 GPE88, laws are often passed with specific people in mind, whether to reward or punish. Notably, in [LOCATION]77, the GPE88n [ORGANIZATION]24 gave President [PERSON]34 permission to use GPE88n armed forces and security services to perpetrate extrajudicial killings abroad on people that [LOCATION]1 accused of extremism. Companion legislation passed [LOCATION]78 expanded the definition of extremism to include libelous statements about [PERSON]33 administration. This legislation effectively gave those who carry out dirty active measures immunity. In addition to the use of the legislative and legal mechanisms at their disposal, the [ORGANIZATION]19 unleashes a barrage of propaganda against those targeted for dirty active measures. These information operations contribute to a climate of fear targeting both the individuals the [ORGANIZATION]19 is trying to silence and the broader population. [PERSON] campaigns are also deployed after the dirty active measure is carried out, in order to sow confusion and make people doubt whether GPE88 is culpable. [PERSON]34 and his inner [STREET] have drawn a distinct narrative, branding those who oppose the [ORGANIZATION]19 as criminals, thus deeming them as deserving of punishment. They are often also accused of being part of the so-called fifth column, GPE88ns that [PERSON]34 defines as advancing foreign interests. Worse than criminals in [PERSON]33 mind are those the [ORGANIZATION]19 viewed as having been loyal in [LOCATION]79 but who are [LOCATION]54 working against the interest of the state. These people are branded as traitors, and as [ORGANIZATION]27 reported [LOCATION]33, traitors hold a special status for [PERSON]34. [PERSON]33 disdain for traitors stems from the early [ORGANIZATION]8s of the end of the Cold War, when dozens of former Soviet intelligence officers became defectors or informants for the [PERSON]. According to the [ORGANIZATION]28, Mr. [PERSON]34 cannot speak of them without a lip curl of disgust. They are beasts and swine. Treachery, he told one interviewer, is the one thing he is incapable of forgiving. It could also, he said darkly, be bad for your health. [PERSON]34 publicly threatened those considered traitors on multiple occasions. One of those episodes occurred in [LOCATION]16. After a spy swap between GPE88 and the United [PERSON], which included the recently poisoned [PERSON]44, [PERSON]34 stated ominously A person gives his whole life for his homeland, and then some . . . blank comes along and betrays such people. How will he be able to look into the eyes of his children, the pig? Whatever they got in exchange for it, those thirty pieces of silver they were given, they will choke on them. Believe me. For [PERSON]34, labeling his political opponents in these stark terms helps to justify the dirty active measures deployed against these individuals. These tactics of dirty active measures have been used with impunity inside GPE88 to silence and intimidate [ORGANIZATION]19 critics and preserve the system of power [PERSON]34 created. They have been unleashed against journalists, opposition leaders, oligarchs, and others seen as betraying the system. A [ORGANIZATION]0 Foreign Relations minority staff report from [LOCATION]81 detailed more than two dozen [ORGANIZATION]19 critics who died under mysterious circumstances in GPE88 since [PERSON]34 took power in [LOCATION]82. The report separately compiled violent attacks and harassment on human rights activists and journalists. GPE88n opposition activists are also a target of dirty active measures inside GPE88. One example was the assassination of [PERSON]45, a popular regional Governor and Deputy Prime Minister under [PERSON]46, who became disenchanted with [PERSON]33 political system. He publicly exposed extensive corruption and covert use of GPE88n hybrid warfare tactics in [LOCATION]0. [PERSON]47, a [LOCATION]1 correspondent for the [ORGANIZATION]30, described the tactics of intimidation deployed against him, including that he was stigmatized as a national traitor and an [PERSON]1n stooge. He was demonized on television and on the streets banners with [PERSON]48 face were hung on building facades framed by the words fifth column--aliens among us. These threats were followed with [PERSON]49 being brazenly assassinated steps from the [ORGANIZATION]19. [PERSON]49 appears to have been killed for exposing corruption in [PERSON]33 inner [STREET] and trying to serve as a constraint on his ability to conduct hybrid warfare operations in [LOCATION]0. These acts were clearly seen as a threat to [PERSON]33 power and his ability to act with impunity. Attacks of dirty active measures inside GPE88 continue unabated. [LOCATION]83, GPE88n journalist [PERSON]50 fell to his death after investigating the [ORGANIZATION]31 paramilitary forces linked to a close [PERSON]34 ally and GPE88n troll farm patron, [PERSON]51. Three additional GPE88n journalists who were investigating [PERSON]52-sponsored, [ORGANIZATION]19-linked military activities, particularly in [LOCATION]2, were killed under suspicious circumstances in [PERSON]7. Just [ORGANIZATION]7, the publisher of a website that exposes [ORGANIZATION]19 abuses in the criminal justice system fell ill from apparent poisoning. This attack occurred on the same [ORGANIZATION]8 he expected to receive the results of an investigation he commissioned into the deaths of the journalists in [LOCATION]2. As I have detailed here, these attacks are not officially linked back to the [ORGANIZATION]19, allowing for plausible deniability, but are part of a clear pattern of tactics deployed against those who work to expose activities that may hurt [PERSON]33 base of power. [PERSON]34 has resorted to using dirty active measures beyond [ORGANIZATION] borders, which demonstrates the willingness of the [ORGANIZATION]19 to use these tactics not only for domestic political purposes but also as part of its hybrid warfare operations to advance [ORGANIZATION] strategic interests against other countries. Similar to other tactics of hybrid warfare operations, [LOCATION]0 is usually where GPE88 deploys these tactics first, a testing ground for tools that may be deployed in the [PERSON] at a later time. We see these tactics of dirty active measures deployed in [LOCATION]0 as far back as [LOCATION]76, when the more [PERSON]ern-oriented [PERSON]53 was poisoned after he won the Presidency, beating [PERSON]54, the preferred pro-GPE88n candidate. The [ORGANIZATION]19 continues to deploy dirty active measures, including assassination, in [LOCATION]0 with impunity. [LOCATION]86, [PERSON]55, a former [ORGANIZATION]22 colonel and a former GPE88n [ORGANIZATION]24 Member, was shot in the head on a crowded [LOCATION]3 sidewalk in broad [ORGANIZATION]8light. [PERSON]56 was once a close [PERSON]34 ally who used his position to promote key [ORGANIZATION]19 priorities, including, ironically, annexing [LOCATION]. He fled to [LOCATION]0 in [DATE] of [ORGANIZATION] and began to criticize [PERSON]33 government. He was slated to provide testimony to [LOCATION] authorities that would expose [ORGANIZATION]19 deliberations prior to hybrid warfare operations against [LOCATION]0. Forebodingly, a few [ORGANIZATION]8s before his murder, he told the [ORGANIZATION]7 Post They say we are traitors in GPE88. Again, the idea that he could be shot brazenly in broad [ORGANIZATION]8light served as a warning to others who might want to expose hybrid warfare operations to think twice, and that they cant escape even if they leave GPE88. Similar tactics were deployed against [LOCATION]4 as it considered and ultimately chose to join [ORGANIZATION]32 in [LOCATION]71 and [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION]19 saw the Montenegrin Governments decision to move closer to the [PERSON] as a threat to its strategic interests, including [ORGANIZATION] ability to operate in Eastern [ORGANIZATION]1 unconstrained. When several other hybrid warfare operations, including propaganda and information operations, failed to keep [LOCATION]4 from joining the alliance, GPE88n military intelligence officers planned and attempted to execute an election [ORGANIZATION]8 coup that included a plan to assassinate the Montenegrin Prime Minister. The attempt on the Prime Ministers life was unsuccessful, fortunately. However, it showed the extremes to which the [ORGANIZATION]19 would go and the methods that were used to try to maintain its strategic interests. Beyond [LOCATION]0 and [LOCATION]4, the [ORGANIZATION]19 has increasingly demonstrated a willingness to use dirty active measures in the [PERSON], suggesting a sense that GPE88 feels it can operate with impunity even in these countries. One [PERSON]ern country where a pattern of GPE88n dirty active measures appears prominently is in [LOCATION]5. Investigative reports have [ORGANIZATION] S6765 unearthed an estimated 16 suspicious deaths over [LOCATION]79 12 [ORGANIZATION]3s, and that may not even be the totality. The most well-k[LOCATION]54n measure of GPE88n dirty active measures inside the [LOCATION]6 is [PERSON]26 [PERSON]58, a former [ORGANIZATION]21 and [ORGANIZATION]22 officer who blew the whistle on corrupt practices of the [ORGANIZATION]22. While [PERSON]58 had retired from spying, he did consulting work with the British and Spanish intelligence services, helping both governments understand connections between the GPE88n mafia, senior political figures, and the [ORGANIZATION]22. Further, he continued to speak out against the [PERSON]34 government and expose [ORGANIZATION]19 corruption. Because of these actions, the [ORGANIZATION]19 branded [PERSON]58 a traitor. He received threatening emails from a former colleague who told him to start writing a will. [PERSON]58 was later poisoned with polonium- 210. The poisoning also served as a deterrent to others. The [ORGANIZATION]8 after [PERSON]58s death, a member of the GPE88n [ORGANIZATION]24 stated The deserved punishment reached the traitor. I am sure his death will be a warning to all the traitors that GPE88n treason will not be forgiven. [PERSON]58s poisoning served as a prologue for the poisoning of [PERSON]35 12 [ORGANIZATION]3s later. [PERSON]44 was a former GPE88n military intelligence officer who was convicted of being a double agent and sentenced to prison. As I mentioned earlier, he was traded as part of a spy swap in [LOCATION]16. He was given asylum in [LOCATION]5. Press reports indicate that, similar to [PERSON]58, [PERSON]44 appeared to have been working with the Spanish, Czech, and Estonian intelligence services. [LOCATION]93, he and his daughter were poisoned by novichok sprayed on the door handle of his GPE4, [LOCATION]7, home. In conjunction with the assassination attempt, [ORGANIZATION]19 officials deflected, denied, and deployed absurd propaganda and disinformation. They unleashed an estimated 2,800 bots to cast doubt on Prime Minister [PERSON]60 assessment that GPE88 was responsible and to amplify divisions among the British people. They blamed the [PERSON] for the poisoning and suggested it was a hoax. Once the [LOCATION]6 named suspects and pointed a finger at GPE88n military intelligence, the two alleged perpetrators went on TV and absurdly claimed to be sports nutritionists with a [ORGANIZATION]3ning desire to visit a GPE4 cathedral. Again, these killings are part of a pattern. Both [PERSON]58 and [PERSON]44 were part of security services. They turned on the state and were deemed traitors. Even when they appeared to be safe, they were targeted for dirty active measures, sending the message that the [ORGANIZATION]19 was the ultimate arbiter and that they could reach traitors anytime or anywhere. This message was also directed at others who might wish to expose [PERSON]33 secrets in the future or try to constrain or challenge his power. The pattern of dirty active measures also extends to the United [PERSON]. This includes [PERSON]61, a former [ORGANIZATION]19 insider who was crucial to [PERSON]33 consolidation of the GPE88n media. [PERSON]62 was also responsible for the rise of GPE88n TV and internet platform [ORGANIZATION]33, a tool the [ORGANIZATION]19 uses to deploy propaganda and disinformation across the world, including against the United [PERSON] during the Presidential election in [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]62 was reported to have had a [LOCATION]53ing out with two members of [PERSON]33 inner [STREET], including a longtime friend k[LOCATION]54n as [PERSON]33 banker. [PERSON]62 was found dead in a [ORGANIZATION]7, [ORGANIZATION]8, hotel room in [DATE] of [LOCATION]71. The [ORGANIZATION]8 coroner concluded that the death was accidental and that he died alone, despite noting that [PERSON]62 had sustained blunt force injuries to his neck, torso, and upper and lower extremities. [PERSON]62 was allegedly planning to tell the secrets of a major component of the [PERSON]32 hybrid warfare operations to [ORGANIZATION]34 when he appeared to have conveniently died before he could explain its inner workings. Similar to other dirty active measures campaigns, the [ORGANIZATION]19 unleashed a disinformation campaign to ensure plausible deniability and generate confusion about the circumstances surrounding his death. Here, too, [PERSON]62 appears to fit the pattern of being targeted for revealing aspects of the hybrid warfare campaigns that the [ORGANIZATION]19 has come to rely on. In what appears to have been an even more brazen move for [PERSON]34, he engaged in dirty active measures while the whole world was watching. While standing next to President [PERSON]5 in [LOCATION]8, President [PERSON]34 proposed that he would allow [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]63 to interview the 12 GPE88n military intelligence officers indicted on charges of large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the [ORGANIZATION] Presidential election. But there was a catch. [PERSON]34 announced that in return, he would expect that GPE88n authorities would be able to question current and former [ORGANIZATION]0 Government officials whom [PERSON]34 described as having something to do with illegal actions on the territory of GPE88. President [PERSON]5 stood next to President [PERSON]34 during this disinformation operation and endorsed it as being an incredible offer that he and his administration actually considered. The very next [ORGANIZATION]8, GPE88n officials announced a list of [DATE] accused criminals whom they wanted to interrogate because, in the course of doing the work of the United [PERSON] of [PERSON]1, they took stances that the [ORGANIZATION]19 opposed. Among those listed was a congressional staffer who helped write the [PERSON]64 sanctions act and former [ORGANIZATION]0 Ambassador to GPE88 [PERSON] [PERSON]36, who served as the point person during [ORGANIZATION] and as Ambassador to GPE88 from [PERSON]3 to [ORGANIZATION]. During [PERSON]36s time as Ambassador to GPE88, the [ORGANIZATION]19 unleashed its hybrid warfare playbook against him. They denounced him as an enemy and had security forces follow his family. The [ORGANIZATION]19 also deployed a disinformation campaign against him that accused him of being a pedophile. The [ORGANIZATION]19 was using these active measures in an attempt to instill fear in him and others that they could be killed, hurt, or jailed for doing the work of the [ORGANIZATION]0 Government. The United [PERSON] and [PERSON]ern countries more broadly must understand that these attacks are not random they are part of a pattern, a doctrine of hybrid warfare being expressed across the globe. We need to understand that assassinations, violence, threats, and intimidation are tools and tactics that [PERSON]34 is using to achieve strategic or foreign policy goals, and these activities are harming our national security. For instance, [ORGANIZATION]27 reported in [PERSON]7 that vital [ORGANIZATION]19 informants have gone silent, leaving our intelligence community in the dark about what [ORGANIZATION] plans are for [LOCATION]96 midterm elections. The report continues that [PERSON]1n officials familiar with the intelligence concluded they have gone to ground amid more aggressive counterintelligence by [LOCATION]1, including efforts to kill spies. These are not just brutal tragedies or incidents the use of dirty active measures are purposeful and are intended to advance [PERSON]33 agenda short of using tools of conventional warfare. The United [PERSON] must lead with strong denouncements against dirty active measures and all other hybrid tactics used by GPE88 or any other country. It is particularly critical that the President denounce GPE88n threats against [ORGANIZATION]0 officials for their actions in carrying out [ORGANIZATION]0 foreign policy or advancing our national security interests. Instead, the Presidents deference to [PERSON]34 at [LOCATION]8 sent the wrong signal to [PERSON]34 in the face of his threats. Fortunately, the [ORGANIZATION]0 has taken some action, including voting 98 to 0 to protect our diplomats and other government officials implementing [ORGANIZATION]0 policy after [PERSON]34 requested they be turned over for questioning. However, our government must speak with one voice and send consistent messages that this kind of action will not be tolerated and that [PERSON]34 will pay consequences for his behavior. While it is important that we respond to these attacks, including with unequivocal denouncements of these tactics by the President and by the [ORGANIZATION], we should not be in the business of trying to respond to these attacks symmetrically. [PERSON]34 resorts to using these tactics because he believes they give him an advantage over the [PERSON]. We need to stay true to our ideals of democracy, human rights, and liberty. [ORGANIZATION] S6766 We dont need to normalize or legitimize these methods by engaging in them ourselves. Doing so would simply create a false moral equivalence that plays right into [PERSON]33 hands. Instead, we must employ responses that play to our strengths. We stand for transparency and accountability in the United [PERSON]. We stand for the rule of law. We must develop and implement a comprehensive strategy that deploys tools that are consistent with and showcase these values. We must shine a light on corruption at the highest levels of the [PERSON]34 regime. We must shine a light on how [PERSON]33 cronies are hiding their ill-gotten gains in the [PERSON]. We must deploy a systematic and strategic messaging campaign that counters the base of [PERSON]33 power, reputation, and funding. We must take these actions in concert with our allies and partners. In response to the [PERSON]44 poisoning, the United [PERSON] expelled 60 GPE88n diplomats, joining with more than 25 ally and partner nations in applying diplomatic pressure on GPE88. This action sent a strong signal that the world would not allow [PERSON]34 to act with impunity. When we act together with our allies and partners to push back against these hybrid operations, it imposes a cost to [PERSON]33 reputation on the world stage, which thwarts one of his major strategic interests. While these steps were in the right direction, they have been undermined by the Presidents words and actions. Despite punitive measures in response to the [PERSON]44 poisoning, the [ORGANIZATION]19 thought that the [LOCATION]8 summit erased that damage. Press reports indicate that [PERSON]ern and [ORGANIZATION]0 intelligence agencies assessed that the [ORGANIZATION]19 was pleased with the outcome of the summit at [LOCATION]8 and is confused as to why President [PERSON]5 is not implementing more GPE88-friendly policies. One important tool in our arsenal for holding the [ORGANIZATION]19 accountable is sanctions, including those on [PERSON]33 inner [STREET]. In particular, sanctions implemented under the [PERSON]64 Act appear to be particularly threatening to him. This act was passed in response to the death of [PERSON] [PERSON]64, who uncovered massive tax fraud and corruption that was traced back to [ORGANIZATION]19 officials. He was arrested in GPE88 and placed in jail, where he was tortured until he died. The origins of the [PERSON]64 Act were to hold accountable those in the GPE88n Government who were complicit in [PERSON]64s abuse and death by sanctioning their assets and barring them from receiving [PERSON]1n visas. Subsequently, the [PERSON]64 Act has been expanded to include others who are culpable of acts of significant corruption and abuse. GPE88 expert [PERSON]69 of [ORGANIZATION]38 testified recently at a [ORGANIZATION]39 hearing about the significance of the [PERSON]64 sanctions to [PERSON]34. She said Because the [ORGANIZATION]19 has based its economic model and its survival on kleptocracy, sanctions and other policy instruments dedicated to preventing the furtherance of corruption--or worse yet in the minds of the [ORGANIZATION]19, to providing accurate information to the GPE88n people of the extent of this corruption--are a powerful countermeasure to [ORGANIZATION] malign behavior. The [PERSON]64 sanctions, along with those designated under the Countering [PERSON]1s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, threaten [PERSON]33 power structure and present a counter-narrative of corruption and abuse by the [ORGANIZATION]19. We need to continue to use these sanctions to hold those who are complicit in dirty active measures and those who are responsible for aggression, corruption, and interfering in our elections accountable. Ratcheting up sanctions on those in [PERSON]33 inner [STREET] is a [STREET] to make [PERSON]34 and his cronies feel pain and has the potential to change their behavior. Additional sanctions should be imposed on oligarchs and high-ranking government officials to target [PERSON]33 base of power and further expose the corrupt nature of their sources of income. We should also consider declassifying the so-called 241 report compiled by the intelligence community along with the Departments of [ORGANIZATION]1 and [ORGANIZATION]6. This report required an assessment of the net worth of senior [ORGANIZATION]19 officials and oligarchs, their relationship to [PERSON]34 and his inner [STREET], and evidence of corrupt practices. If we were to release such a report--with redactions for portions with national security implications--to the public, it would further expose malign activity and unexplained streams of wealth. [ORGANIZATION] has provided many tools for the administration to implement, and it is time to utilize them fully. Implementing them in a transparent, public manner is likely to cause reputational harm to [PERSON]34 himself and restore a level of confidence in the administration here at home. However, specifically targeting sanctions this [STREET] is unlikely to cause large-scale harm to the GPE88n people or to our [ORGANIZATION]1an allies. It is very clear that implementing sanctions is far more effective when done with the cooperation of the international community. The most effective sanctions regimes are those that are implemented in a multilateral fashion. I urge the administration to engage with our allies and partners to coordinate sanctions enforcement and further escalatory steps as warranted. That includes working through diplomatic channels to ensure that the sanctions placed on GPE88 by the [ORGANIZATION]1an Union remain in [STREET]. A coordinated front of the United [PERSON] and our [ORGANIZATION]1an allies provides the greatest chance of successful implementation of sanctions and deterring further aggression by GPE88. The administration must also [STREET] a premium on exerting diplomatic pressure to isolate those who flout or do not enforce sanctions on GPE88. Another form of pressure should be an increase in assistance to pro- democracy and civil society groups in GPE88 and in nations of the former [PERSON]00. Working with these groups in conjunction with our allies, partners, and the private sector would provide another means of raising the costs of [PERSON]34 and his oligarchs. [PERSON]34 is threatened by the success of democracies and private enterprise. In addition to sanctions, we must continue to play a strong role in law enforcement, along with our allies and partners. That includes aggressive prosecution of murders and threats of violence to limit the impunity. With [PERSON]58, it took almost 10 [ORGANIZATION]3s for [LOCATION]5 to have an official inquiry into the assassination. [PERSON]01 has acted quicker in the wake of the [PERSON]44 poisoning, moving to identify suspects and hold the [ORGANIZATION]19 accountable for these actions. We need to adopt [LOCATION]6s lessons learned to ensure that those who seek to use these weapons will be prosecuted fully and without delay. We have missed too many of these dirty active measures operations for far too long. We must recognize this is an element of [ORGANIZATION] hybrid warfare. We must not fail to have the imagination to see what is happening right before our eyes. We must do more to identify and attribute these attacks from GPE88. These attacks have only grown more brazen and will not stop unless we take strong measures to counter them and send the message that dirty active measures are unacceptable and will be costly to GPE88 or any other country which uses them. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. [PERSON]70. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. [PERSON]71. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

This is the truth about systems of oppression, about modern white civilization, a fucked up rule of law lawlessness. This is it in our world.

No co[ORGANIZATION]try for old men, for yo[ORGANIZATION]g people, for the sick, disabled, poor, mentally challenged, psychiatrically impaired. This is a co[ORGANIZATION]try for no regular people. Yet, we will hear the media mental midgets yammer on and on about [PERSON] bumkins, [PERSON] flyover fucks, deplorables, or deploying any other la[ORGANIZATION]dry list of pejoratives or socio-psych mumbo jumbo for their elite brains to find more ways to subjugate the many in the name of profits, and in the words of their deep alter egos  The world of elites and beautiful and worthy and good members of society have to deal with these [PERSON]eless breeders, breathers and eaters. Really, all we want is whats best for the masses, for these misbegotten, less than high IQ, and multiple-dysf[ORGANIZATION]ctional people who in some cases, well, dont mean to be [PERSON]eless eaters, breeders, breathers, existers. But we can corral them into good deeds, and we can make so much money from their faults, chronic illnesses, their low IQs, their inbreeding, their constant bad bad bad decisions in life. Their mistakes and pain and dysf[ORGANIZATION]ction are our opport[ORGANIZATION]ity to make society the [STREET] we want it designed, with a few trillion of profits in greenbacks to boot. But we would never say this outright to PERSON8 or PERSON9 or ORG19 or what not. But reality is always local, no matter how much bullshit college sports and pro football teams and idiotic Republican and Democrat lying and spewing interferes with their noggins. For example, the outfit I work with, as a social services guy, doesnt ask our clients  developmental and intellectual disabled adults  if they have had the jab, but rather, they ask If an employer asks you to provide proof of vaccination, will that be a problem? That is the reality now  adults barely surviving, after their whole lives have been spent in special ed programs and being evaluated, separated, roomed, ho[PERSON]ed and institutionalized, and many coming from proverbial messed up families, dysf[ORGANIZATION]ction being the f[ORGANIZATION]ctional word  I have to navigate more of the same systems of oppression-poverty inducing-safety net fraying eating at our comm[ORGANIZATION]ities very souls. The chances of getting part-time work in a field tied to the five Fs food, fur, factory, filth, foliage  restaurants, dog cleaning, wareho[PERSON]es, janitorial, and landscaping are already slim, as so much is stacked against these folk. Think about the propaganda aro[ORGANIZATION]d those with developmental disabilities are more vulnerable to the covid so they need to be vaxxed first ideology. Many clients were so scared that they were more or less forced into getting the ORG10 or J amp38 J, both mRNA biomedical experimental treatments. Most live in supported ho[PERSON]ing, and most of these in group homes, sanctioned by the state, so the vaccine mandates are not j[PERSON]t inferred, but demanded. Boosterism booster x, y, z, [ORGANIZATION] will continue to r[ORGANIZATION] rampant. More will be sick. Some will die, or course. The reality is I know people who are losing jobs, and they are not sitting on piles of cash like a lot of professionals you might read about that are opting out of the forced chemical jabs. These people do not have the luxury of taking a stand with [ORGANIZATION]limited credit card limits, or fully owned homes, or hobby gardens out back with the swimming pool. These are people who read up about this planned pandemic, who take precautions, who listen to experts. Their choice is to not get jabbed. Imagine, being a teacher, PhD in physics, after [PERSON], and you have DATE8 paid and you ref[PERSON]e to do the jab but accept the draconian test and mask.

Many people I speak with and comm[ORGANIZATION]icate with are tired of the pro-pro-pro forced jab perspective we are getting from the leftist ORG31, and from [ORGANIZATION]7. I am referencing [PERSON], ORG31, DATE14, from the anti-science pro-some-science get-out-of-that-sciences [STREET] thinking coming from some of the articles posted on the site. Very sad in many ways, so sad that there is not a rob[PERSON]t disc[PERSON]sion of the vaccination that we see on ORG32, even [ORGANIZATION], and especially ORG34. Here, bullet points, direct quoting from [PERSON]  Im against any exemptions our social contract should require either all of [PERSON] to get it or that the jab be completely vol[ORGANIZATION]tary , but if theres a religio[PERSON] exemption there should beone for philosophy,20too.

Now, we are worried about more of the celebrities, this time, a professor who was sacked  Academic Fired Following [ORGANIZATION]3 Lobby Smear [PERSON]6 Speaks Out w Lowkey25 Now, think about any criticism against any [ORGANIZATION]iversity, when you are employed by the institution. I was employed by ORG39. I was an [LOCATION]0 faculty, part-time, a radical, and I fought like hell for adj[ORGANIZATION]cts, for students, etc. I was part of a group of students as a faculty member who made a human chain to stop the group of overweight sheriff posse dudes dressed up as Conquistadors on horses strutting on camp[PERSON].

[LOCATION]1 ran a front page photo of these [ORGANIZATION]dercover cops jumping out of the b[PERSON]hes, and wrangling students, clobbering male and female with forearms to the neck.

Professor [PERSON]7, [PERSON], p. 324 source28 Finally, another point from a friend [PERSON]y Felonio[PERSON] Fraudulent [LOCATION]2 Read [LOCATION]5 latest. During the panel29, the [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]9 ofthe[ORGANIZATION]erasked the questionWhy dont we blow the system up? Obvio[PERSON]ly, we j[PERSON]t cant turn off the spigot on the system we have and then say Hey! everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we havent given to anyone yet, butthere m[PERSON]t be some [STREET].[PERSON]9 then mentioned how vaccine production is antiquated and asked how sufficient disruption could occur to prompt the modernization of the existing vaccination development and approval process. [ORGANIZATION]0 responded first, saying that as a society we are behind where we need to be when it comes to moving toward a new, more technological approach and that it is now time to act to make that a reality. [TIME], [PERSON]5 stated that the superior method of vaccine production involves not growing the vir[PERSON] at all, but getting sequences, getting the appropriate protein and it sticking in on self-assembling nanoparticles, essentially referring to mRNA vaccines.[LOCATION]2 then stated The critical challenge . . . is that in order to make the transition fromgetting out ofthe tried and true egg-growingmethod . . . to something that has to be much better,you have to prove that this works and then you have got to go through all of the critical trialsphase 1, phase 2, phase 3and show that this particular product is going to be good over a period of [ORGANIZATION]1. That alone, if it works perfectly, is going to take [ORGANIZATION]2.[LOCATION]2 later statedthatthere is a need to alter the publics perceptionthat the flu is not a serio[PERSON] disease in order to increase urgency andthat it would be difficult to alter that perception along with the existing vaccine development and approval process [ORGANIZATION]less the existing system takes the posture thatI dont care what your perception is,were going to address the problemin a disruptive [STREET] and an iterative [STREET]. During the panel, [ORGANIZATION]1 statedthat we need to move as quickly as possible and urgently as possible to get these technologies that address speed and effectiveness of the vaccine before disc[PERSON]sing how the White Ho[PERSON]e Co[ORGANIZATION]cil of Economic Advisers had j[PERSON]t issued a report emphasizing thatprioritizing fast vaccines was paramo[ORGANIZATION]t. [ORGANIZATION]1 then added that a mediocre and fastvaccine was better than a mediocre and slow vaccine. He then said that we can make better vaccines and make them faster and that urgency and disruption were necessary to produce the targeted and accelerated development of one such vaccine. Later in the panel, [ORGANIZATION]1said the best [STREET] to disrupt the vaccine field in favor of faster vaccines would be the emergence of an entity of excitement out there thats completely disruptive, thats not beholden to bureaucratic strings and processes. He latervery directly said thatby faster vaccines he meant mRNA vaccines. The [ORGANIZATION]1-led [LOCATION]7 and the [LOCATION]2-led [LOCATION]8 in j[PERSON]t a few [ORGANIZATION]7 time became the biggest backers of the [LOCATION]9 [ORGANIZATION] vaccine, investing billions and co-developing the vaccine with the company, respectively. As will be explained in Part II of this series,the partnership between [LOCATION]9 and the ORG36 to co-develop what would soon become [LOCATION]9s [ORGANIZATION] vaccinewas being forged [ORGANIZATION]4, long before the official declaration of the [ORGANIZATION] crisis as a pandemic and before a vaccine was proclaimed as necessary by officials and other individuals. Not only did the [ORGANIZATION] vaccine quickly become the answer to nearly all [LOCATION]9s woes but it also provided the disruptive scenario necessary to alter the publics perceptions of what a vaccine is and eliminate existing safeguards and bureaucracy in vaccine approval. Watch the [ORGANIZATION]5 [PERSON]. As Part II of this series will show, it was an alleged mix of serendipity and foresight from [LOCATION]9s [ORGANIZATION]3 and the ORG36s [ORGANIZATION]4 that propelled [LOCATION]9 to the front of the Warp Speed race for a [ORGANIZATION] vaccine. That partnership, along with the disruptive effect of the [ORGANIZATION] crisis, created the very [PERSON] for which [LOCATION]9 had been desperately waiting since [ORGANIZATION]6 while also turning most of [LOCATION]9s executive team into billionaires and multi-millionaires in a matter of [ORGANIZATION]7. However, [LOCATION]9s [PERSON] wont last - that is, [ORGANIZATION]less the mass administration of its [ORGANIZATION] vaccine becomes an [ORGANIZATION]8 affair for millions of people worldwide. Even though real-world data since its administration began challenges the need for as well as the safety and efficacy of its vaccine, [LOCATION]9 - and its stakeholders - cannot afford to let this opport[ORGANIZATION]ity slip through fingers. To do so would mean the end of [LOCATION]9s carefully constructed ho[PERSON]e of cards.

el paso,2019-02-21T00:00:00Z,Dissident Voice,El Paso Times,"homeless, squatter","Shifting Baselines in a Time of Climate Change, Systems Stagnation, Life and Death in a Time of Amnesia","We were among the very few who were granted asylum. In DATE0 I graduated from [ORGANIZATION] and studied at [ORGANIZATION], receiving a bachelors of science.  Former refugee at a press conference1 in [ORGANIZATION], at FAC0 once volunteered at ORG2, in [ORGANIZATION], during [LOCATION]. I was chipping away at my graduate degree in English, teaching as a TA at UT-[ORGANIZATION], as well as working freelance writing gigs with both [TIME] and [TIME] newspapers, teaching one-on-one conversational English to an engineer in [PERSON] who was working for [LOCATION] getting paid one-tenth the pay as his fellow [ORGANIZATION], writing a couple of books, and being active in environmental and social justice issues tied to protesting the militarization of the border and the overuse of [ORGANIZATION] as a toxic slough and drawing down of the [PERSON] aquifer for golf courses. Heck, in [ORGANIZATION] during this time I even worked for [ORGANIZATION] helping write a media plan against a mean son-of-a-bitch who called himself a Jew for [ORGANIZATION] who set upon the clinic no abortions done there mean as cuss religious zealots who tried to block women and families from seeking [ORGANIZATION] services and such.[PERSON] started the ORG6 in [DATE] and by the time I got there, at FAC1, the dirty wars in LOC2 were really ramped up against teachers, unionists, activists, politicals on the left, priests, nuns and anyone questioning the right wing policies of [ORGANIZATION]-backed governments and the thug henchmen of those administrations, the death squads in [LOCATION], [PERSON], and [PERSON], and the contras in [LOCATION]. Part of the fallout created by those [ORGANIZATION]-trained militarists, economists and lawyers who perpetrated that harm against their own people was that many small towns and villages - regular people of the land, la tierra - were being caught in the crossfire. Entire villages were told in [TIME] by the fascists to pack up and head out of their pueblitos by sundown. Many girls, women and old ladies were raped and murdered. Beheadings of husbands and grandfathers, fetuses cut out of bellies, and torture of anyone who was suspected of going against [ORGANIZATION] Capitalism were the order of [ORGANIZATION]. As far as media coverage goes My baseline was different than that of [PERSON]. When I was in [ORGANIZATION], in [ORGANIZATION] and working along the border, there were much more robust forms of journalism and ground-truthing reporting going on than anyone [PERSON] in [LOCATION] could image. The baseline was a more open, aggressive ORG7 willing to pull away more of the onion layers to get to the truth. Really, many editors and most of the newspaper journalists had no issue with peering through the looking glass to uncover truth, and their motto was that governments do and will tell lies. Now comparing the number of print newspapers, dailies, and weeklies and [ORGANIZATION], even magazines and broadsheets, newsletters, and the like that were inking up paper in my time, and then looking at the ORG7 now, going on DATE8 of study and my own battles as a writer, anyone young can never really know what has been lost in this impetus of the ORG7 then who were striving for independence, in a good [STREET]. Its the old saws of not having their own boots on the ground then, not having an authentic real point of view because they never lived and worked then, what is termed liberally by me as the shifting baseline syndrome. Im talking about small-town journalism, medium-sized market news, and quirky and unique [ORGANIZATION]. While the so-called liberal media [ORGANIZATION] was not liberal at all, what was happening in newsrooms and with editorial boards, for the most part, in [LOCATION]0 and [LOCATION]1 was, compared to [PERSON], more nurturing to truth tellers, with a truer sense of why journalisms ethical code points us to looking at as many sides as possible to weigh in on editorial decision-making. Sort of akin to what a lot of people use as a baseline for liberal sic versus conservative, comparing [PERSON]s neoliberal democrats, for instance, to someone like [ORGANIZATION], or looking at [ORGANIZATION] Republicans such as PERSON3 [PERSON] to so-deemed ORG9 Republicans of old. When I was born, [LOCATION]3, the Republican [ORGANIZATION]0 platform was much more progressive and populist than that of [ORGANIZATION]1 of the millionaires or billionaires when looking at proverbial [PERSON]. Get a load of this, [LOCATION]4 Should any political party attempt to abolish [ORGANIZATION]2, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things, but their number is negligible and-and the president says-their number is negligible and they are stupid. PERSON5, Republican President The platform for [LOCATION]5 under the banner of [ORGANIZATION]3 included fighting for workers, the right to form a union, for health and safety measures at workplaces, for a strengthened [TIME] work, for social welfare programs for individual citizens to be strengthened, and more and more positive programs along the lines of [PERSON]s milquetoast progressives. [PERSON] was backed by [ORGANIZATION]3, and it was [ORGANIZATION] who fought to keep the tax rate for the very rich fair, which in [PERSON]s baseline would be considered [STREET] too high and communist! For instance, the top income tax bracket in [LOCATION]6 was [DATE]. And, [ORGANIZATION] fought tooth and nail to ensure that it remained at that rate. Can you imagine PERSON8 or PERSON9 or [PERSON]0 backing this? Forget the neocons, the professors of [ORGANIZATION]4 brainwashing Capitalism even wanting any tax rate other than zero percent 0.00  for the rich, for the corporations, who are now persons with full rights of person-hood. How many rich individuals and how many corporations pay no taxes [PERSON], and how many have tax shelters legit mafia-style money-laundering outfits overseas, in GPE7 or [PERSON]? We have winks and nods and complete red-faced debates and retorts against the accusation that the rich pay no taxes, or certainly not enough, with bald-faced defenses by tens of millions run-of-the-mill [LOCATION]ns who support their flavor of rich manrich woman in [LOCATION]. Imagine, rooting for millionaires and billionaires? By welfare recipients or middle-class soccer moms. What does [PERSON]1 call it, [ORGANIZATION]? For [LOCATION]7 this was considered un[LOCATION]n to support the rich over the poor! Thats one difference I have experienced - when I was a teenager and college puke, most people hated the rich for what they were. Many average working class people looked at rich as sociopaths who were only rich because they exploited the average [LOCATION]n citizen. Add to the baseline shift from [PERSON] versus back then my bosses at newspapers were not multimillionaires, and many more newspapers by a factor of 5 or 10 in [LOCATION]0 and [LOCATION]9 were independent and competitive, compared to [DATE]0. Back then, the baseline was that many reporters were vying to get the scoop on real news stories. [LOCATION] and facts were a given anything else rose to the level of pink slip offenses. That robust nature of things back then  even though for the most part, as a socialist and Marxist, I never did fit personally into any paradigm in a newsroom  was things that youd never see printed [PERSON] in the few small town newspapers left there are hardly any left across [LOCATION], anyway were vigorously printed in many more newspapers back then. From Salon4 According to [ORGANIZATION]5 research, the country has lost nearly 1,800 local newspapers since [DATE]1, and many more have lost the ability to comprehensively cover their communities. Rural counties with poorer, older populations are most at risk  500 rural papers have shuttered since [DATE]1. These communities are also less likely to see a digital start-up help fill the void  as funding for both for- and non-profit models are more available in metro areas, and many rural counties across the [PERSON]0 still lack broadband internet access, which is critical for delivering online news. More than 200 counties in the [PERSON]0 have no local paper, but thats just part of the story, or this new shifted baseline Local ownership of papers is eroding big time. Get this  nearly one-third of [PERSON]0 newspapers and two-thirds of dailies are now owned by 25 companies. GateORG6 [ORGANIZATION] is rapacious, buying up small-town papers. That means the news is controlled by Big Brother Being The Oligarchs, many times edited a thousand miles or more from the towns or counties that are supposedly being covered. Copy-editing and editorial decisions for GateORG6 originate in [PERSON]1, [PERSON]2. Its the number one small and medium newspaper owner in the [ORGANIZATION]A, and its model of efficiency means many fewer reporters and a more insipid and irrelevant TV style content which is also replicated shared widely. Murders, celebrities, food, weather not global warming pet tricks, celebrity food, celebrity weather, celebrity pet tricks, celebrity murders idiocy of the umpteenth degree. I have a case in point a massive militarized police presence was in [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5, [DATE]2, resulting in closing the main [STREET] east-west, locking down schools and the [ORGANIZATION]8 facility I worked at as a social worker. There were civilian-clothed snipers with high powered rifles w higher powered scopes all over dozens of multi-agency personnel out in public with pistols brandished, and two armored vehicles with gun turrets that rammed the offending ex-vets big pick-up truck. He had just been evicted from the [ORGANIZATION]8s homeless veterans transition center for suspect reasons. The entire homeless facility was bombarded with [ORGANIZATION]-outfitted police thugs, and no one was allowed to enter or leave the facility, creating high levels of anxiety with already PTSD-addled veterans and their homeless families. The veteran was shot seven times, after [TIME] of staged hostage negation-like stuff, even though he was alone, pinned in his own pickup truck. The [ORGANIZATION]8 leadership later said it was a coup for them this bizarre religious organization - Thank goodness we controlled the story and very few media outlets picked it up. We want to protect our brand in [PERSON]5 . . . as the number one non-profit. Now, imagine if there had been one or two beat reporters, like myself in [DATE]3, vying to find out what really happened and why so much force had been deployed for a suicidal veteran basically isolated in his pick-up who could do no harm to anyone but himself? My baseline would have been news coverage galore, and better yet, follow up coverage. [DATE]4, nothing, not even in the [PERSON]6, [PERSON]5 media market that serves millions of residents. And this is the [ORGANIZATION]8, funded by the [ORGANIZATION] taxpayer i.e., ORG22 paying for beds for those veterans to be housed. This is the shifting baseline syndrome, which is a sickness tied to outfits like the [ORGANIZATION]8 using PR flaks and using the fact there are no newspapers in [PERSON]7 to cover local news and this disturbing show of military force and what the implications of a military operation in their neighborhood might mean in the future. No less, against a veteran who was getting services from a well-known homeless center. Local news, and then news that has national and international implications, lost. Not covered. In the memory hole! Shifting baseline syndrome means the public gets shafted and the administrators and gatekeepers of information  PR and marketers and development officers - get to lie through their teeth, or in the case of my police-involved shooting incident even that term is dripping with propagandist flavor, no one knew the ramifications of the [ORGANIZATION]8s unprofessionalism and lack of trauma informed care leading up to the soldiers eviction and then the suicidal behavior and then the soldier almost killed, and now, recovering in [PERSON]8 lock-up jail serving time. And hes still suicidal, untreated. Job well done by the keepers of the information flow. Shifting baseline disease. Read the three parts of my [ORGANIZATION]8 mess here, [PERSON]. In [LOCATION], I had published pieces in small towns newspapers, and later in the [ORGANIZATION] ORG23 and [ORGANIZATION] ORG24 on LOC2n refugees, on people crossing the border seeking asylum, on groups, both religious and secular, helping undocumented people cross the border and get help once here and to apply for political asylum. Piece published on the front pages of many small town rags I worked for. My baseline then was we still had [TIME] and [TIME] rags, and weeklies, that debated hard the militarys presence in towns like [PERSON]9 or [ORGANIZATION]. Debated hard the debasement of the environment through the unchecked developers razing the desert. Debated hard the values of community health, welfare, safety and well-being over the wants and desires of small and large companies coming into communities and demanding tax abatements, giveaway land schemes, and more-more-more from the public coffers to do their trickster capitalism to make more-more-more for the owners, CEOs and stockholders. Now Democrats and Republican alike [ORGANIZATION] cheer trillions in military spending. Job creation and [ORGANIZATION]0 [LOCATION] the Greatest masturbation. - Im going back to [PERSON] In his final address to the country, in [DATE]5, while still a five-star general, and still a believer in the [LOCATION]n [STREET], in [LOCATION]n exceptionalism, in [LOCATION]s greatness both sides of the political isle yammer on and on to show their patriotism, he did at least put into check the [ORGANIZATION] military industrial complex Our military organization [PERSON] bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or [ORGANIZATION]1. Until the latest of our world conflicts, [ORGANIZATION]2 had no armaments industry. [LOCATION]n makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, [DATE] men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We [DATE] spend on military security more than the net income of all [ORGANIZATION]3 corporations. This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the [LOCATION]n experience. The total influence  economic, political, even spiritual  is felt in every city, every ORG25 house, every office of the ORG26 government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together. Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent [LOCATION]7. source8 Now, I have to back up a bit to reset this essay I continue [PERSON]  just hitting [DATE]7  to call this myopia and concerted erasure of knowledge and historical context what [PERSON]2 calls [ORGANIZATION]2 of [LOCATION] shifting baseline syndrome covering many aspects of my life, the life of [LOCATION] and the implications to the world that the [ORGANIZATION] Empire negatively effects. I explain this concept [DATE]8 as I go about living and roaming, learning and teaching, struggling and rejoicing. Here, illustratively The baseline for divers like me, in [ORGANIZATION] called FAC2 by many then, for [LOCATION]0 and [DATE]9 I was diving [DATE]8 near [PERSON] and [PERSON], out near LOC7 from the boat my buddy and I paid 500 from a lake fisherman from [ORGANIZATION]6. So, a typical dive - dozens of turtles of three or four species, dozens of moray eels of a dozen species pinnipeds like sea lions by the hundreds long beak and short beak dolphins by the dozens hammerhead sharks by the dozen over two hundred species of reef fish, crustaceans, and sponges and soft corals brown pelicans by the hundreds pelagic fish and groupers and barracuda and amazing surface fish, nudibranchs and, well, in [TIME] dive, more than what any overpaid ORG27 CGI technical wonk could create, let alone dream of. Thats the baseline for an [ORGANIZATION]0 in [ORGANIZATION]1, me, a wanna be [PERSON]3 and marine biology college major. Fast forward [ORGANIZATION]2, and the baseline of another [PERSON]4 diver, same age, well, now a decimated, overfished, multi-polluted ocean, with hardly a shadow of what I saw on typical dives in [LOCATION]0. The baseline shifted, and [PERSON], the syndrome, in the shifting baseline syndromedisease analogy, would be the arrogance, historical stupidity, and hubris to believe that a healthy and normal reef dive is what it should be as experienced in [DATE]0. The syndrome and disease of shifting baselines it that it is most likely even smart biologists might be working on staving off further decline in an ecosystem based on the present baseline. What you dont see now normalizes one to see what they see now as the correct baseline to go by. Wrong. Now transfer the shifting baseline syndromedisease to almost every aspect of [ORGANIZATION] society no, the baseline for police involvement in our lives is not a ORG28, shoot to kill first force, where we all are in fear, while witnessing pigs murder [PERSON] and African [LOCATION]ns with impunity. Judge, jury and executioner, no, is not the baseline we should be stuck with or happy with. Baseline sickness now applied to what it means to be a student - my baseline was a university where faculty had freedom to teach, that more were on the tenure track, where students would be experimenting with ideas and learning, without fear of ORG29 thugs hobbling them for life with 100 K debt or censuring like [PERSON]5 of ORG30 fame or ORG31 do regularly to researchers. Yes, the baseline in [ORGANIZATION]1 when I was coming of age was that we COULD protest in the streets without fear of felonies, without being sprayed upon with tear gas and rubber bullets at every event where cops were in small numbers, and there were no drones and militarized [ORGANIZATION] teams for peace demonstrations. Baseline was for [ORGANIZATION]1 one hell of a lot more book readers, more by a power of 10,000 regular thinkers, and more people who had newspapers in their hands and talked about local politics by a power of 1,000,000. Shifting baseline syndrome is now infecting every sector of our lives, where what is acceptable thinking, behavior, standard operating procedures and collective will NOW are so bastardized, retrograded and devolved that the conversation about anything on any tract - food-medicine-science-arts-law-education-international politics-community standards-health-safety-welfare of the environment-ownership-birth and death-cradle to cradle planning  is an effort in alien talk, as if people [PERSON] are from a completely new set of gravitaional laws. Idiots call this the new normal, another shifting baseline of not only bastardizing language but Orwellizing it. War is Peace, Lies are [LOCATION], Stupidity is Smarts. New normal! Now, back to we all are illegal aliens, where I helped push that bumper sticker in [ORGANIZATION] as a solidarity protest meme, to illustrate that no [LOCATION]n [ORGANIZATION] leaders came together to endorse the free passage of all those whites to use their great LOC8 as a haul-out like a bunch of molting fur seals. Here, my writing, [ORGANIZATION]3, for ORG32, just below. Talk about no shifting baseline for me, or in the case of this hatred of Mexicans and LOC2ns, displayed by more than just [PERSON]6 and his ilk. Oh, once you hit 50 or 60, the ramifications of this French doozy really sink in plus a change, plus cest la mme chose  the more things change the more they stay the same - It hearkens to the proverb, Turbulent changes do not affect reality on a deeper level other than to cement the status quo.What is the [ORGANIZATION] status quo when it comes to people displaced by [LOCATION]n Empire structural and military and economic and environmental violence? [ORGANIZATION]4 Their Land, and We Are the Illegal Aliens9 By [PERSON]7 [PERSON]8, [ORGANIZATION]5 We are all illegal aliens. Its a bumper sticker many of us on the frontlines of the fight against [ORGANIZATION]2 governments assault on LOC2ns plastered on our car bumpers down [ORGANIZATION] [STREET]. That was in [LOCATION].You know, when [PERSON]9 was running amok ordering his captains [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, the whole lot of them, to send bombs, ORG33-torture manuals and [ORGANIZATION] agents in order to aid terrorist contras and other despotic sorts in killing hundreds of thousands of innocents in civil wars in [PERSON] and [LOCATION] and El [PERSON]. We worked with women and children who had witnessed fathers, uncles and husbands eviscerated by [ORGANIZATION]-backed military monsters. Victims of torture, in [PERSON]2 illegally. You know, what those brave [PERSON] and ORG34-brandishing, chaise lounge Minutemen of [PERSON] would call aliens. We worked with people in faith-based communities, mainstream churches, and non-profits throughout [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and the general area known as [ORGANIZATION]. Everyone I met working with in this refugee assistance stint had humanitarian blood coursing through their veins. We were proud of our law-breaking work  we gave refuge to terrorized and sometimes half-dead civilians. We were called lawbreakers by the [PERSON]9ites and the Minutemen of that time. Communists. Pinko-fags. Those were [DATE] of low-tech surveillance and simple ORG35 lists. But what we did was human and humane, in the tradition of that very universal with roots in Quakerism belief in bearing witness and acting upon that which has been judged as unjust and inhumane. Of course, we were up against the laws of this land and coarse politically-driven judges who denied victim after victim permanent or temporary status while seeking asylum in the [ORGANIZATION]. We have so many stories of people sent back who were at best imprisoned, and in the worse cases, mutilated, disappeared, and murdered. [LOCATION]n and [PERSON]ans, that is. My readers may not want to hear the narratives and visualize the descriptions of photos of those victims of torture. Ghastly things happened to teachers, nuns, medical workers and farmers, more heinous than what weve heard happened in the cells of [PERSON]. We were there to assist, but more importantly to bear witness to our countrys terror campaign. Some of us got so riled up that later in our lives  me included  we hoofed it to LOC2. Kicked around. Wrote articles for the few newspapers in this country that even cared about poor, misbegotten, displaced people of Latin [LOCATION]. But no matter how hard-nosed we became, or how much we could withstand the photographs of womens sliced backs and beheaded fetuses, we couldnt shake the images of the children of torture at this two-story refugee house, Annunciation ORG6. It was full of scruffy-looking [PERSON]1 volunteers who had hooked up with [PERSON], the ORG6s director, through Catholic services organizations. It was their stint with public service, their spiritual duty calling. Part of their degree plans. But most were converted and slammed hard intellectually and spiritually by the violence their charges had suffered under in our name - as [ORGANIZATION] citizens paying taxes. Those PTSD-induced cartoons those children drew sucked the air out of even the hard-ass border patrol guys who used to dump the LOC2ns at [ORGANIZATION]3 door at [TIME]. Who can believe it now, that once upon a time official ORG38 and border patrol officers knowingly let their perps go  knew that [ORGANIZATION]4 and his volunteers could salve emotional and physical wounds of these tortured crossers. Their chance at freedom. Except for the piss-ant judges. And the memories of pregnant aunties being raped, their fetuses cut out alive, speared, and the laughing [PERSON]9-loved military punks in the highlands and jungle. Annunciation ORG6 was bulging at 100 people  disheveled lives jammed in. Beans always cooking. Songs. Mattresses and piles of donated clothes. Guitars strumming. Gueros, the white ones, and the Chicanos would help with in-takes  asylum transcripts, translation, dotting all the is and crossing the ts. Help with getting jobs. Odd jobs in the community. Help with making sure the refugees didnt get caught again. But it was always those by-the-letter-of-the-law jurists helping to confound the torture. More than 70 percent of our brothers and sisters seeking asylum in the [ORGANIZATION] were denied entry by some fat cat, many times cocaine-sniffing immigration judge who usually had a friend in the back pocket of some [ORGANIZATION]5 or buddy of [ORGANIZATION]5 somewhere. Then it was trying to get the denied victims off to [ORGANIZATION]8 without being caught. You remember, the [ORGANIZATION]8 back then which used to open its borders to refugees, the [ORGANIZATION]8 of shifting baseline syndrome. The judges and politicians and Minutemen all professed, Send them back. Those aliens broke our immigration laws. But we are all illegal aliens as a rejoinder went much farther than [ORGANIZATION]As mayhem in [PERSON]2. We worked in solidarity with the housekeepers, bricklayers, agricultural workers and so many other worthy Mexicans who worked their butts off in the [ORGANIZATION] for little pay and much less respect. These were workers who crossed [ORGANIZATION] to find low-paying jobs with [LOCATION]n families and businesses  working for mayors, bigwigs, even on government contracts. In [PERSON]2, [ORGANIZATION]9, [LOCATION]0, elsewhere. With a wink and a smile by the [LOCATION]n exploiters. [LOCATION]1  wetback. Squatter. [PERSON]. Illegal alien. These were the more tame epithets. But lets not kid ourselves about the genesis of this new round of empowered [PERSON] fighting against racist laws put forward by the dispassionate conservatives running the ship of fools in [LOCATION]2. This is not a country of legal immigrants. Its a country based on colonialists, undocumented white people who helped displace native tribes through broken laws and genocide. Its a country based on illegal occupation of native lands and on [LOCATION]9s lands, pure and simple. Colonialists protected by ORG26 laws that deemed free white people as the only ones who had the right to be fully-fledged citizens. [PERSON] was a violent racist act to seize lands illegally. Everything this countrys current anti-Mexican and [PERSON] border war proponents stand upon  all that doctrine and those so-called laws  is based on illegally seizing lands of Native tribes. And worse  laws that removed natives. Laws that starved natives. Laws that approved of eradicating native families, entire tribes. The current massive turnout of students and workers alike in this countrys major cities is a testament to these [LOCATION]ns backbone to fight this new exclusionary law  HR437710  a [LOCATION]3, [LOCATION]2-inspired racist act that has its roots in the Chinese Exclusion Act of [ORGANIZATION]6. Many [LOCATION]ns do express a certain humanity and dignity for the people many deem aliens, but its not awe-inspiring that some citizens of [LOCATION]4, [LOCATION]5 or [LOCATION]6, [LOCATION]7, disobey the so-called immigration laws of this country during [DATE] as landed immigrants. Lets make no bones about the motives of [ORGANIZATION]6, the author of this racist ORG6 bill He sees those brown-skinned south-of-the-border lettuce pickers, linen washers, house framers, and their [ORGANIZATION]-born children as, what? Alien gang members terrorizing communities. Anyone spouting that we are a nation of immigrants and laws has a disease, what [ORGANIZATION]7 called the illness of double-think. And until those many white [LOCATION]ns stop spewing that this is their land, a land of their laws, and a land made for [ORGANIZATION]ians, the racist Minutemen will ramp up their gun brandishing on the southern and northern borders. And racist politicians will continue to play on the fears of uniformed constituents and try to pass the [ORGANIZATION]7 Centurys racist exclusionary laws. I wonder what these [ORGANIZATION]8 Nazis would say about those childrens cartoons  images of bodies floating in rivers. Blood-soaked church walls. Military men with their M-16s trained on men while others are sketched in their rape hunch. Beautiful jungle birds flying in the sky next to [ORGANIZATION]-paid-for helicopter gunships spraying the corn and coffee fields below. Dead mommies cradling dead babies. Yeah, Im an illegal alien. We all are illegal aliens, under the laws of these creeps in high office. Humanity and caring and simple benedictions for suffering so much, those are alien traits only held by a minority in this country of exclusion, and slavery. Yeah, those creeps on hate-radio and in the newspaper columns and on ORG39, sure, they recognize all of us who see the lies and fight the injustice as aliens. And the children whose post-traumatic cartoons brought tears to men and women, some who had fought in [LOCATION]8. Simple [LOCATION]0 colorings brought tears to a county sheriff who had survived drug runners shooting up his town and unearthed bodies. Yeah, we are all illegal aliens. Except them.

Statewide Texans who have power in their households need to reduce their energy usage as much as possible to reduce stress on the states power [ORGANIZATION]. You can reduce your electricity usage by turning down the thermostats below 68 degrees, unplugging lights and appliances, and avoiding use of large appliances like ovens and washing machines. For people without power or heat, [ORGANIZATION] encourages people to close blinds and curtains, close off rooms and stuff towels in the cracks under the door. Texans should also wear layers of warm and lightweight clothing and make sure to eat and drink to warm the body up. State officials are strongly discouraging unnecessary travel due to the hazardous conditions on the roads caused by the snow and ice. If you are in need of power and are able to travel, the ORG1 website6 includes a list of warming centers across the state. We still cannot guarantee the safety of the roads. If you absolutely must [STREET], please stay off freeways and bridges, treat roads like a school zone, remember stoplights are down, and get to where you will stay [TIME] by [TIME] Roads will worsen again then.

FAC0 opened as a warming center, but it is at full capacity and it is no longer accepting more people, according to [LOCATION]. Homeless outreach teams from the sheriffs office, [INSTITUTION], and homeless outreach groups have worked to provide rides to the warming centers. [ORGANIZATION] area residents can call the [ORGANIZATION] non-emergency line at [PHONE] or 311 for information about shelter or transportation. The sheriffs office ORG6 has been providing items like coats, blankets and tents to people experiencing homelessness who are not in a warming center. People can donate [PERSON] to any of the organizations in ORG7, a coalition of organizations working to prevent homelessness. [PERSON] officials are encouraging individuals in need of shelter to go to ORG8. Families should go to ORG9. Officials have also opened three other shelters at ORG10, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. People with pets will not be turned away and they will be accommodated through ORG13, according to [PERSON].

el paso,2017-12-01T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,KFOX,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] Charge: Asset Managers are [ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]',"They also say that asset managers have been filling gaps in the financial system that emerged in the wake of the global financial crisis - theyll need to capitalize on and expand these once-niche markets. Thirdly, while they make the common point that traditional active managers feel a squeeze between passive management on the one hand and alternatives on the other, they go further in that direction than other analysts have, saying that the [STREET] to react to this squeeze is not to try to beat back the competing forces but to join them, to turn a management firm into a multi-asset solutions firm. But perhaps the most surprising of the four points is the contention that asset management has been a refuge of digital technology laggards, and that this will change in the near future, as technology giants enter the sector, flexing their data analytics and distribution muscle. The race is on. [ORGANIZATION]? One might be excused for thinking on the contrary that this field has been a technology pace setter in [ORGANIZATION], with blockchains, [ORGANIZATION], algorithmic execution, etc. Although, yes, [ORGANIZATION] sees that some firms, especially heavily quantitative alternative investment firms, have been as these authors put it leveraging technology in specific areas of their business, it also contends that the first truly technology-enabled firm has yet to emerge. Ceasing to Be [ORGANIZATION] As such firms do emerge, some of the job descriptions to which were accustomed will disappear. For example, investment analyst. Research teams with lots of human investment analysts working together - that is over - replaced by exponential advances in computing power, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and big data. [ORGANIZATION] managers are among the most innovative firms in the space, the least laggardly, and they will likely lead the [STREET] as the revolution comes. This report says that investment analysis is a task inherently suited to computers, it can be done with lots of data and correlation-seeking power, both of which are what the digital revolution has been all about. The back and middle offices will be automated or outsourced. Global utilities will emerge to be the recipient of the outsourcing of know-your-client, transfer agency, trade processing, and tax reporting functions. Of course, carbon-based people are going to have to guide the firms into this new world of streamlined front offices with silicon-based analysts. To hire the best people, the report says in a sidebar, diversity in all its forms will matter more than ever - from gender, generation, ethnicity, sexuality and disability to people with a broader range of skills, experience, and industry backgrounds. [ORGANIZATION]s research indicates that firms still have a long [STREET] to go in making diversity a reality and realizing the benefits. Filling the Financing Gaps As noted above, one of the themes of the report is the emergence of certain financing gaps since the [ORGANIZATION], which have become profitable niches or more-than-niches for alpha generators. When the authors get around to fleshing this point out, they disclose that what they have in mind includes syndicated lending activities for large infrastructure projects. We anticipate soaring growth in real assets - mainly infrastructure and to a lesser extent real estate. [ORGANIZATION] anticipates a 27.5 per annum growth rate in infrastructure through [LOCATION], slowing to 15 in [DATE] after that. People in [LOCATION], [PERSON], and LOC2 are migrating to cities, creating an urgent need for infrastructure there waste, power, and transportation. Infrastructure is shifting from pure-play, low-risk to deal sourcing, evaluation, and asset management. In real estate, asset managers in [ORGANIZATION] will make greater use of ways to gain exposure such as REITS and will expand in non-traditional areas such as rental, multi-generational, and affordable housing.Be Sociable, Share!  1"

el paso,2022-02-28T00:00:00Z,People's Daily Online - English,El Paso Times,"homeless, homelessness",Full text: The Report on Human Rights Violations in [LOCATION] in [DATE],"-- [ORGANIZATION] has the worlds highest number of [ORGANIZATION] cases and deaths, with 34.51 million confirmed cases and 480,000 fatalities, which far surpassed the numbers in [ORGANIZATION]. Average life expectancy fell by [ORGANIZATION], the biggest drop since the Second World War. -- Public security situation in [ORGANIZATION] deteriorated and violent crimes remained prevalent. There were 693 mass shootings in [DATE], up 10.1 percent from [ORGANIZATION]. More than 44,000 people were killed in gun violence. -- More than 420 bills with provisions that restrict voting access have been introduced in 49 [ORGANIZATION] states. Only 7 percent of young Americans view the country as a healthy democracy, while public trust in the government has fallen to almost historical low since [ORGANIZATION]. -- Around 81 percent of Asian American adults said violence against Asian communities is rising. Hate crimes against Asians in [PERSON] jumped 361 percent from [ORGANIZATION]. Fifty-nine percent of Americans said ethnic minority groups do not have equal job opportunities. -- In [DATE] [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] detained more than 1.7 million migrants at its southern border, including 45,000 children. Violent law enforcement claimed 557 lives, the highest number since DATE5, which more than doubled that of [ORGANIZATION]. -- A [ORGANIZATION] drone strike during its withdrawal of troops from [PERSON] killed 10 members of an Afghan family, including seven children, among which the youngest was [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] still held 39 detainees at the FAC0 prison. [ORGANIZATION], a special rapporteur on minority issues of [ORGANIZATION], said the [ORGANIZATION] legal system of human rights protection is incomplete and outdated, which has led to growing inequality. As for the [ORGANIZATION] malpractice in creating human rights crises in other countries in the name of human rights, [PERSON], a professor of international relations at [ORGANIZATION], said Americans must first fix what has gone wrong at home and rethink how they deal with the rest of the world. In [DATE], the [ORGANIZATION] public persona of human rights defender was totally debunked as the so-called [ORGANIZATION] under the guise of safeguarding human rights became a farce. At the 48th session of [ORGANIZATION] Human Rights Council, many countries blasted [ORGANIZATION] for being the biggest destroyer of human rights in the world and urged the country to address its own severe human rights violations. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] AND CONTROL Despite having worlds most advanced medical equipment and technology, [ORGANIZATION] has the biggest number of [ORGANIZATION] infections and deaths globally. The [ORGANIZATION] government never rethinks its response measures and still lacks effective anti-epidemic plans. Instead, it stoked the origins-tracing of [ORGANIZATION], and has been keen on passing the buck, shifting the blame and political manipulation. Disregard for peoples rights to life and health. Since the outbreak of [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], the epidemic prevention and control has been highly politicized, which has become a tool and a bargaining chip for Republicans and Democrats to attack, reject and confront each other. [ORGANIZATION] politicians focused only on their political gains in disregard of peoples lives and health. The federal and local governments went their own [STREET] and constrained each other, which has not only made it very difficult to integrate and coordinate the management of medical resources, but also made people disoriented about epidemic prevention and control policies. And thus various anti-intellectual words and deeds that reject science and common sense have become prevalent. Misled by political manipulation, some Americans refused to wear masks, and even launched an anti-vaccine movement, which accelerated the spread of [ORGANIZATION]. By the end of [DATE], nearly 30 percent of Americans still had not been vaccinated, according to the [ORGANIZATION] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that [ORGANIZATION] hospitals were overwhelmed as [ORGANIZATION] cases and hospitalizations caused by infections among the unvaccinated continued to surge. States, local governments and the public have now been left out on their own, American news website ORG7 said on [DATE], [DATE]. According to data from [LOCATION], by [ORGANIZATION]1, the number of confirmed [ORGANIZATION] cases in [ORGANIZATION] had exceeded 78 million and the death toll surpassed 940,000. Its number of [ORGANIZATION] deaths recorded in [DATE] has far surpassed the total for [ORGANIZATION]. According to the analysis by researchers at ORG9 and [ORGANIZATION]0, the deaths caused by [ORGANIZATION] have reduced overall life expectancy by [ORGANIZATION], the biggest drop since the Second World War. Life expectancy was estimated to fall by [ORGANIZATION]2 among African Americans and [ORGANIZATION]3 among [PERSON], while the decline was [ORGANIZATION]4 among whites. The [ORGANIZATION] governments unscientific, unequal and irresponsible epidemic prevention and control conducts have seriously undermined its peoples rights to life and health. [ORGANIZATION]1 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the pandemic has proved to be a [ORGANIZATION]6 stress test that [ORGANIZATION] flunked, and that the American peoples trust in their government has been bankrupt. Peoples mental health deteriorated due to the uncontrolled outbreak. A study published in [ORGANIZATION]2 [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]4 [DATE] found 32.8 percent of [ORGANIZATION] adults experienced elevated depressive symptoms in [DATE], compared to 27.8 percent in the early [ORGANIZATION] months of the pandemic and 8.5 percent before the pandemic. According to a public opinion poll, more than a third of Americans aged [ORGANIZATION]9 said the pandemic is a significant source of stress in their lives. The poll finds teens and young adults have faced some of the heaviest struggles as they come of age during a time of extreme turmoil, the ORG6 reported on [DATE], [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] Surgeon General PERSON2 was cited by [ORGANIZATION]3 as saying on [DATE], [DATE] that the number of suspected suicide attempts in [DATE] was 51 percent higher among adolescent girls compared to [DATE]2 in [DATE]3. The number of the homeless is staggering. [ORGANIZATION]4 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that homelessness is one of [ORGANIZATION] greatest current challenges, no matter the region. The ORG6 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the number of people without permanent shelter in [ORGANIZATION] had increased by more than 85 percent since [DATE] [DATE]. According to a report by the group [ORGANIZATION]5, more than 100,000 GPE7 schoolchildren were homeless at some point during the [ORGANIZATION]-[DATE] school year. The total number of homeless students during [DATE]8 represented nearly one-tenth of the citys [INSTITUTION] system. Some students had to live in cars, parks or abandoned buildings. [ORGANIZATION]1 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that in [LOCATION] one of every 100 residents was homeless. The elderly rights to life are flagrantly violated. [ORGANIZATION] politicians have followed the natural law of selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior, declaring that the elderly could sacrifice for the country and that the national economy is more important than the lives of the elderly. The [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] said that the vast majority of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] deaths have been among people aged [DATE]9 or older. According to [ORGANIZATION]7, an American health-oriented news website, more than half a million elderly people in [ORGANIZATION] have died from [ORGANIZATION], accounting for four-fifths of all fatalities. According to a report by [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] independent expert on older people, on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION], discrimination in the delivery of health care services, insufficient prioritization of nursing homes in responses to the virus, and lockdowns left older people more vulnerable to neglect or abuse. And there was a significant undercount of nursing home deaths in [ORGANIZATION] during the pandemic. Serious damage to the global anti-pandemic cooperation. [PERSON] vigorously pursues [ORGANIZATION]8, not only withholding anti-epidemic materials from other countries, but also prohibiting the export of domestic medical materials and buying out the production capacity of drugs that may be used to treat [ORGANIZATION] patients. [ORGANIZATION] has repeatedly coerced the [ORGANIZATION]9, interfering and dragging down global anti-pandemic cooperation. [ORGANIZATION] has engaged in vaccine nationalism, pushing some underdeveloped countries and regions into a desperate situation of having no vaccines to administer. Since March [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] has thrown away at least 15 million doses of [ORGANIZATION] vaccine, significantly more than many poor countries have prepared for their whole populations, according to [ORGANIZATION] on [DATE], [DATE]. Its really tragic that we have a situation where vaccines are being wasted while lots of African countries have not had even 5 percent of their populations vaccinated, said [ORGANIZATION], an associate professor of global health law at ORG21.South African President PERSON5 also slammed rich countries over their hoarding of vaccines, adding that they are just giving us the crumbs from their table. The greed they demonstrated was disappointing. The [PERSON] administration is still pursuing [ORGANIZATION] interests in ways that are detrimental to the interests of the rest of the world, commented an article on the website of the [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]4 magazine. II. [ORGANIZATION] LIVES [ORGANIZATION] has consistently had one of the highest rates of violent crimes in the world. Gun control measures have been stagnant and gun violence has been rife. The police are discriminatory in law enforcement, killing innocent people and causing public anger. Law enforcement officers commit crimes with impunity, and judicial injustice has been widely criticized. Wrongful and unjust cases continue to exist without being corrected and compensated effectively. Prison inmates are abused, and domestic violence as well as youth violence has increased significantly. The American people live in fear of lack of security. Deterioration of social order has accelerated the proliferation of guns. [ORGANIZATION] is the country with the largest number of privately owned guns in the world. The [ORGANIZATION] public have lost confidence in the governments social security governance and felt extremely insecure, which drives many to purchase guns to protect themselves. [ORGANIZATION] researchers estimate that Americans own 393 million of the 857 million civilian guns available, which is around 46 percent of the worlds civilian gun cache. There are 120 guns for every 100 Americans, according to the ORG22. No other nation has more civilian guns than people. ORG23 also reported on [DATE], [DATE] that over 15 million guns were sold through [ORGANIZATION]4. Ghost guns, which are assembled from parts purchased by individuals online, are even more proliferating. According to a report by [ORGANIZATION]1 website on [DATE], [DATE], over [ORGANIZATION]6, ghost guns had accounted for 25 to 50 percent of firearms recovered at crime scenes. By the beginning of [ORGANIZATION]4 [ORGANIZATION]56, ORG25 had recovered almost 400 ghost guns, about doubling the total for all of [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION]8 to go in [ORGANIZATION]9. It also reported that since DATE40, about 25,000 privately made firearms had been confiscated by local and federal law enforcement agencies nationwide. Gun violence seriously endangers peoples lives. [ORGANIZATION] has the worst gun violence in the world. According to statistics released on DATE41 by the ORG26 website, the number of fatalities from shootings in [ORGANIZATION] rose from 39,558 in [DATE]3 to 43,643 in [ORGANIZATION], and further to 44,816 in [DATE]. In [DATE], there were 693 mass shootings in [ORGANIZATION], up 10.1 percent from [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that children and teens in [ORGANIZATION] are 15 times more likely to die from gunfire than their peers in 31 other high-income countries combined, quoting data from [LOCATION]. At least 30 shootings occurred on [ORGANIZATION] campuses during DATE43 from Aug. 1 to [DATE]5, [DATE], killing at least five people and injuring 23, the highest number on record. A total of 1,229 teens aged DATE45 were killed and 3,373 injured in shootings in [ORGANIZATION] in [DATE]. On [DATE], [DATE], four students were killed in a mass shooting at a [ORGANIZATION]0 high school by a DATE47 suspect who used the same gun that his father bought on DATE48.ORG29 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that [ORGANIZATION], an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at ORG30, said that [ORGANIZATION] is the only developed country where mass shootings have happened DATE50 for DATE51. Shooting incidents have caused a large number of casualties and posed a major threat to public safety. According to an [DATE] [DATE] ORG31 survey, 48 percent of Americans see gun violence as a very big problem in the country DATE53. Police brutality tramples human life. According to data compiled by ORG32, at least 1,124 people died in [DATE] due to [ORGANIZATION] police violence. The majority of killings occurred during non-violent offenses or when there was no crime at all. The [ORGANIZATION] website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that police in [ORGANIZATION] fatally shoot about 1,000 people [ORGANIZATION]1. Police have fatally shot more than 6,300 people since DATE55, but only 91 officers have been arrested, or just 1 percent of those involved. The [ORGANIZATION] website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that a poll showed that just 22 percent of Americans believe that the [ORGANIZATION] police treat all Americans equally. Racial and ethnic groups are often subjected to unfair justice. The [ORGANIZATION] website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that a DATE58 African-American man in [ORGANIZATION]1, PERSON8, was shot and killed by police after being pulled over outside [ORGANIZATION]2 for an expired license plate. PERSON9 death was one of a string of incidents in which African-Americans were pulled over for traffic violations and killed innocently. A study of 20 million traffic stops in [ORGANIZATION]3 over DATE59 shows that African American drivers are twice as likely as white drivers to be pulled over by police. The [ORGANIZATION] website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that within [ORGANIZATION]1 of the death of [PERSON]0, who died after an officer knelt on his neck for [TIME], enforcement killed hundreds of people of ethnic minorities in [ORGANIZATION]. According to the report, since [ORGANIZATION]9 2000, there have been over 470 murders at the hands of law enforcement in [ORGANIZATION]1. Only one police officer was convicted in the history of [ORGANIZATION]1 and that was a minority man that killed a white woman. The ORG34 website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that ORG35 found that homicides with a white perpetrator and a black victim are ten times more likely to be ruled justified than cases with a black perpetrator and a white victim. Human rights violations by prison staff are commonplace. [ORGANIZATION] has the highest incarceration rate and the highest number of incarcerated people in the world. An ORG36 investigation has found that the [ORGANIZATION] federal ORG37 is a hotbed of graft, corruption and abuse. ORG38 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that crimes committed by federal prison staff in [ORGANIZATION] are not uncommon. Since [DATE]3, more than 100 [ORGANIZATION] federal prison staff members have been arrested and convicted of sexual abuse, murder and other offenses. Prisoners held in [ORGANIZATION] private prisons are at risk of being abused. ORG39 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that in [DATE]3, there were about 116,000 [ORGANIZATION] prisoners held in privately operated facilities, representing about 7 percent of all state prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners, quoting data from the [ORGANIZATION] Bureau of Justice Statistics. On [DATE] 20, [DATE], nine [PERSON]1 experts, including the [PERSON]1 Human Rights Council Working Group of Experts of People of African Descent, [PERSON]1 Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Independent Expert on the Enjoyment of all Human Rights by [PERSON], [PERSON]1 Right to Physical and [ORGANIZATION], issued a joint statement condemning [ORGANIZATION] human rights violations against [PERSON]2, a prisoner of African descent. The statement said [PERSON]3, who has been in prison for [ORGANIZATION]7, was a social activist and journalist. The [ORGANIZATION]8 suffers from a number of diseases including chronic heart disease, liver cirrhosis and high blood pressure. In [DATE] [DATE], he was diagnosed with [ORGANIZATION]. While receiving treatment for heart failure in [ORGANIZATION]0, he was handcuffed to his hospital bed for [ORGANIZATION]1 and when he was hospitalized again in [ORGANIZATION]2 for surgery, his family, lawyers and others were denied access to him. The statement calls on the [ORGANIZATION] government to comply with its international human rights obligations, take urgent measures to protect [PERSON]3s life and dignity, immediately stop the practice of withholding information, and allow outside visits to monitor his human rights situation. It also calls on the [ORGANIZATION] government to take all necessary measures to protect the lives of all detainees, especially the elderly and disabled prisoners who are disproportionately affected by the [ORGANIZATION] outbreak. The credibility of the [ORGANIZATION] judicial system is in tatters. According to statistics released by the [ORGANIZATION] National Registry of Exoneration on [ORGANIZATION]3, 2,933 people have been wrongly convicted in [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION]4, with a combined [ORGANIZATION]5 of wrongly imposed prison sentences. However, 14 [ORGANIZATION] states lack legal provisions related to compensation for wrongful convictions. The [PERSON]4 reported on [DATE], [DATE], that [PERSON]5, [ORGANIZATION]6, had maintained his innocence since his arrest at [ORGANIZATION]7. He was wrongly convicted of third-degree murder in [ORGANIZATION]8, only to be found not guilty in [DATE] before being imprisoned for [ORGANIZATION]9, the longest wrongful imprisonment in [ORGANIZATION]4 history. But under the states law, he is unlikely to receive any financial compensation. The [PERSON]5 website reported on [DATE], [DATE], that a survey showed that only 17 percent of Americans believe the [ORGANIZATION] criminal justice system treats everyone fairly. III. PLAYING WITH FAKE DEMOCRACY TRAMPLES ON POLITICAL RIGHTS Political donations bring about transfers of interests after elections, political polarization further intensifies antagonism and division in the [ORGANIZATION] society, and legislation and gerrymander restricting voting eligibility have become tools for parties to suppress the public opinion. The operation of the [ORGANIZATION] political system is moving away from the public will and social demands, the right of the majority of the public to participate in politics is essentially deprived of, and international confidence in the [ORGANIZATION] democratic system continues to decline. The American-style democracy has descended to a game of transferring interests. Money politics become increasingly rampant in [ORGANIZATION], which makes politicians more neglectful of peoples interests and demands. [PERSON]6, a political commentator and social activist at [PERSON]6, has pointed out that there is a positive correlation between Americans wealth and their influence on policy-making, and for about 70 percent on the income-wealth scale, they have no influence on policy whatsoever and are effectively disenfranchised. [PERSON]7, professor at [PERSON]7, noted in an article for [PERSON]8 that [ORGANIZATION] current system is democratic only in form, not in substance, as the nominating process is vulnerable to manipulation by plutocrats, celebrities, media figures and activists, while many presidential-primary voters mistakenly back candidates who do not reflect their views. According to [PERSON]9 on [DATE], [DATE], candidates spent 14 billion [ORGANIZATION] dollars alone on advertising for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] president election cycle. The [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 and [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION]2 reported on [DATE] 15, [DATE] that Wall [STREET] executives, their employees and trade associations invested at least 2.9 billion [ORGANIZATION] dollars into political initiatives during the [ORGANIZATION] election cycle. The [ORGANIZATION] media outlet [ORGANIZATION] said on [DATE], [DATE] that a secret-money group doled out 410 million [ORGANIZATION] dollars in [ORGANIZATION] to [LOCATION], aiding the latters efforts to win back control of the [ORGANIZATION]5. In the [ORGANIZATION] presidential election, [ORGANIZATION] pharmaceutical companies made huge political donations to both parties, and the Democratic administration, after taking office, invested an enormous sum of money back to the companies involved, with [ORGANIZATION]6 alone earning profit of nearly 1 billion [ORGANIZATION] dollars. The federal government then funneled interests directly to pharmaceutical companies by purchasing large quantities of [ORGANIZATION] vaccines, resulting in massive hoarding and waste of vaccines in [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] government gave pharmaceutical companies a free hand in pricing [ORGANIZATION] vaccines, leading to continuous increases in vaccine prices. [ORGANIZATION]7 reported that [ORGANIZATION]8 raised the price of its [ORGANIZATION] vaccine for [ORGANIZATION] from 15.5 euros to 19.5 euros, and the price of a [ORGANIZATION]6 jab increased to 25.5 euros from 19 euros. However, the production cost of a [ORGANIZATION]6 dose is estimated to be less than 3 [ORGANIZATION] dollars. Political polarization leads to an increasingly divided [ORGANIZATION] society. The election chaos in [ORGANIZATION] has further intensified political polarization and continues to tear the society apart. On [TIME] of [DATE], [DATE], prompted by the incitement and manipulation of extreme politicians, tens of thousands of Americans who rejected the [ORGANIZATION] presidential election result flooded to [LOCATION], and a large number of demonstrators forced their [STREET] into the FAC1 building and clashed with police, leaving five dead and more than 140 injured. The constitutional process to affirm the presidential election result was interrupted. A [ORGANIZATION]9 online article in [DATE] [DATE] indicated that though all 50 states certified the [ORGANIZATION] election results, 77 percent of Republican voters still questioned the legitimacy of the elected president due to allegations of electoral fraud, a phenomenon that happened for the first time in DATE84. Changes of government did not reduce or remove the political polarization in [ORGANIZATION]. The American people are becoming more incompatible with each other over such issues as pandemic prevention and control, race relations, abortion rights and gun control, while the political struggle between Democrats and Republicans over infrastructure construction, social welfare bills, government debt ceiling and other legislation related to the economy and peoples livelihood have become more intense, and the [PERSON] has been nearly dysfunctional. A Republican leader even went so far as to deliver a record [TIME] speech in the [PERSON] to block and delay a vote on a Democratic-proposed bill. The ORG31 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that [ORGANIZATION] was regarded as the most politically polarized country in a survey involving 17 advanced economies, as 90 percent of the American respondents said there are at least strong conflicts between those who support different parties, and about six-in-ten thought their fellow citizens disagree not only over policies, but also over basic facts. Confrontations between political parties restrain and harm electors right to vote. In order to win elections, Republicans and Democrats used legislation and gerrymander as well as other tactics to aggressively prevent voters who do not favor them from casting a ballot. In [DATE], 49 states in [ORGANIZATION] introduced more than 420 bills that would restrict voting. These bills either reduced the amount of time voters have to request or mail in a ballot, restricted the availability of drop-off locations, imposed stricter signature requirements for mail-in voting, or enacted new and stricter voter-ID requirements, which made mail-in voting and early voting harder and built barriers for the elderly, disabled, minorities and other groups to exercise their voting rights. [ORGANIZATION] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the state of [ORGANIZATION]6 was pushing dozens of restrictive voting bills targeting African American voters. Voting rights experts and civil rights groups have argued that the movement adds up to a national assault that would push voters of color out of the electorate. [PERSON] has become a tool to suppress the political influence of minority voters. The Democratic and Republican parties exploit their political clout in each state to increase the chances of winning by redrawing congressional districts, often at the expense of the rights of minorities.[ORGANIZATION]2 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the practice of redrawing congressional districts often targets voters of color and the gerrymandering in [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]7 and [ORGANIZATION]8 alone gave Republicans 16 to 17 more congressional seats. DATE88 newspaper [ORGANIZATION] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that [ORGANIZATION]9 redistricting aimed to keep Democrats in control of the state legislature for DATE90. ORG63 ORG64 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the redrawn congressional districts for [ORGANIZATION]7 give Republicans an unconstitutional partisan advantage, with which the Republicans can anticipate winning 67 percent to 80 percent of the congressional seats -- even though they are only likely to obtain about 55 percent of the vote. [ORGANIZATION]3s reported on [DATE], [DATE] that although [ORGANIZATION]0 has seen a significant increase of the number of people of color, its new redistricting plan intentionally diminished the power of [ORGANIZATION] and African American voters. [ORGANIZATION] Texans make up nearly 40 percent of the population, but just seven of the 38 congressional districts are predominantly [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]0 is home to the largest African American population in the country, but not one of the 38 congressional districts in the state is predominantly black. In a survey of the American public on the fairness of congressional districting, only 16 percent of the surveyed thought that congressional districts would be re-drawn fairly in their states. The international communitys confidence in [ORGANIZATION] democracy continues to decline. A national poll of [ORGANIZATION] 18- to DATE92 released on [DATE], [DATE] by [ORGANIZATION] at ORG67 showed that only 7 percent of the surveyed viewed [ORGANIZATION] as a healthy democracy, and 52 percent believed that the American democracy is either in trouble or failing. Data released by the ORG31 in [DATE] [DATE] indicated that the American public trust in the government neared a historic low since [ORGANIZATION], as only 2 percent of Americans said they can trust the [ORGANIZATION] government to do what is right just about always, and only 22 percent said they can trust the government to do what is right most of the time. In an opinion published on [DATE], [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]4 said that in DATE95 the world has been horrified by the chaos, dysfunction and insanity of American democracy, which was seen by [ORGANIZATION] allies as a shattered and washed-up has-been. British Prime Minister [PERSON]8 said what happened on FAC2 was disgraceful. German President [PERSON]9 said the FAC1 riot was the result of lies and more lies, of divisiveness and contempt for democracy, of hatred and incitement -- even from the very highest level. A research has showed that just 14 percent of Germans and fewer than 10 percent citizens in [ORGANIZATION]1 saw American democracy as a desirable model for other countries. Despite the fact that the [ORGANIZATION] democracy is proved to be a complete failure and its global image is badly damaged, the [ORGANIZATION] government held the so-called Leaders [ORGANIZATION] in a high profile, politicizing democracy and using it as a tool to form cliques and force other countries to take sides, in an attempt to split the world. The so-called Leaders [ORGANIZATION] is in essence a summit that undermines global democracy, and has been widely criticized and condemned by the international community.French political scientist PERSON20 said that it is always difficult to preach what one does so badly itself. [PERSON]5, [ORGANIZATION]1, and other American media have also commented that American democracy is falling apart and [ORGANIZATION] must first address its own failings, and that critics questioned whether [ORGANIZATION] could be an effective advocate for democracy amid problems at home. IV. INDULGING IN RACIAL DISCRIMINATION EXACERBATES SOCIAL INJUSTICE The virus of deeply-entrenched racism in [ORGANIZATION] is spreading along with the novel coronavirus, with anti-Asian hate crimes happening frequently, discrimination against Muslim communities increasing steadily, and racial persecution of indigenous populations still remaining, which has led to an even widening racial economic divide and growing racial inequality. Asian Americans face increasingly severe discrimination and violent attacks. As a result of [ORGANIZATION] politicians manipulation over racial issue, the number of attacks targeting Asian Americans has drastically increased. According to a report published on [DATE], [DATE] by [ORGANIZATION], from [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] to [DATE]0, [DATE], a total of 10,370 hate incidents against Asian American and [LOCATION] people were reported to the organization, and a majority of the incidents took [STREET] in spaces open to the public like public streets and businesses. Statistics released by ORG70 on [DATE], [DATE] showed that anti-Asian hate crimes in the city rose by 361 percent from that of [ORGANIZATION]. According to a report of [ORGANIZATION]4 on [DATE] 22, [DATE], a ORG31 survey found that 81 percent of Asian adults said violence against the group was rising. [ORGANIZATION]1 commented that no vaccine for racism. It said that Asian [ORGANIZATION]4ers live in fear of attacks, and the psychological effects of anti-Asian violence have scarred Asian communities in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that one in four Asian Americans feared that members of their household would be attacked or threatened because of their race or ethnicity. On [DATE], [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]01 PERSON21, a white male, launched gun attacks at three Asian-owned spas in [ORGANIZATION]2, killing eight people. Six of them are Asian women. The deadly shooting epitomizes an escalation of discrimination and violent attacks against Asian-Americans in the country in [ORGANIZATION]02, sparking unprecedented anger and fear. Thousands of Asians and people of other ethic groups took to the streets in massive [ORGANIZATION] rallies and marches. On [DATE]8, [DATE], an [ORGANIZATION]04 man from [ORGANIZATION]3 was deliberately knocked down to the ground and then died in [LOCATION]. On [DATE] 23, [DATE], PERSON22, a [ORGANIZATION]06 Chinese man, was attacked from behind and fell to the ground on a [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION]4. He then was repeatedly kicked in the head, which caused facial fractures. After [ORGANIZATION]07 in a coma, he eventually died in hospital. On [DATE], [DATE], three Chinese high school students were violently assaulted on a subway train on their [STREET] home from school in [ORGANIZATION]5. It was clear that they were picked on because they were Asian, said a local police officer. On [DATE] 3, [DATE], a report of [ORGANIZATION]1 documented more than 110 anti-Asian incidents in [ORGANIZATION]09 with clear evidence of racial hatred. Over [ORGANIZATION]10, in an unrelenting series of episodes with clear racial animus, people of Asian descent have been pushed, beaten, kicked, spit on and called slurs. Homes and businesses have been vandalized, said the report. That was just a tip of the iceberg of racist attacks on Asians in [ORGANIZATION].[PERSON]4 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that being regarded as a permanent alien is a painful experience shared by many Asian Americans, and under the combined effect of xenophobia and anti-communism, the [ORGANIZATION] government has been suspicious of Chinese scientists for [ORGANIZATION]12. Since the implementation of the so-called [ORGANIZATION]6 Initiative in [ORGANIZATION]13, Chinese scientists have frequently been subjected to gratuitous harassment, monitoring and crackdown by the [ORGANIZATION] government. Vile and absurd acts of the [ORGANIZATION] law enforcement authorities have been constantly exposed by the media. [ORGANIZATION]1 on [DATE], [DATE] reported on its website that about 2,000 academics at institutions including [ORGANIZATION], ORG73 and [ORGANIZATION]0 have signed an open letter, expressing concerns that the initiative unduly targets researchers of Chinese descent. The ORG75 DATE88 News reported on [DATE], [DATE] that nearly 100 ORG75 professors have jointly published an open letter condemning the [ORGANIZATION]6 Initiative, saying that it is invasive and discriminatory, disproportionately targets researchers of Chinese origin, and poses threats to scientific inquiry and academic freedom. They called for an end to the initiative. According to an investigation by [ORGANIZATION], a majority of cases under the initiative have had charges dismissed or are largely inactive. Several Asian-American civil rights groups in [ORGANIZATION] said that investigation against Chinese under the initiative would lead to discrimination and stigmatization. PERSON23, a Chinese scientist victimized by the initiative, said the current situation of scientists of Chinese origin is similar to that of [PERSON]5ese-Americans sent to internment camps during World War II, almost like a return to the PERSON24 era. On [DATE], [DATE], ORG77 published an article titled Rivalry Without Racism on its website, saying that [ORGANIZATION] foreign-policy makers consistent overexaggeration of [ORGANIZATION]6s threat to [ORGANIZATION] is a vital element of the recent surge in anti-Asian incidents. Demonizing [ORGANIZATION]6 leads to the demonization of Asians in the country, and until policymakers stop using [ORGANIZATION]6 as a punching bag for all of [ORGANIZATION] woes, Asian Americans will continue to be at risk, said the article. Discrimination and attacks against Muslims are on the rise. ORG78 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that over [ORGANIZATION]16 since the [ORGANIZATION]17 terrorist attacks, discrimination against Muslim Americans has surged. [ORGANIZATION] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that a poll found 53 percent of Americans have unfavorable views toward ORG79. In a [DATE] report, [ORGANIZATION] said it receives more complaints of bullying and [ORGANIZATION] rhetoric [ORGANIZATION]18. A report published by the [LOCATION]1 [ORGANIZATION]7 chapter on [DATE], [DATE] showed that more than half of the students surveyed across [ORGANIZATION]7 said they do not feel safe at school because they are bullied for their Muslim heritage. Thats the highest percentage the [ORGANIZATION]7 chapter has documented since the survey started in [ORGANIZATION]20. A survey released on [DATE], [DATE] by [LOCATION]2 in University of [ORGANIZATION]7, [LOCATION], found that 67.5 percent of the Muslim participants had experienced [LOCATION]-related harms and that 93.7 percent of the respondents said they had been impacted by [LOCATION] emotionally or physically. The aborigines have long suffered cruel racial persecution. [ORGANIZATION] has a long and dark history of violating the rights of indigenous people, including [ORGANIZATION], who have experienced bloody massacres, brutal expulsions and cultural genocide. An article titled [ORGANIZATION] Must Reckon With Its Own Genocides published on the website of [LOCATION]4 on [DATE], [DATE] noted that over the course of [ORGANIZATION]23, more than 350 indigenous boarding schools were funded by the [ORGANIZATION] government, which aimed to culturally assimilate indigenous children by forcibly separating them from their families and communities to distant residential facilities. Until [ORGANIZATION]24, hundreds of thousands of indigenous children had been uprooted from their homes and many had been abused to death in those boarding schools where their American GPE41n, [PERSON], and Native Hawaiian identities, languages, and beliefs were forcibly suppressed. [ORGANIZATION] is not just morally, but also legally responsible for the crime of genocide against its own people, said the article. During the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic, [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]9, [PERSON]0 and other Native Americans have struggled with disease and poverty, which, however, has all been systematically ignored. [PERSON]1, which stretches across [PERSON]2, [LOCATION] and [PERSON]3, was once among the areas with the highest rates of [ORGANIZATION] infection across the country. [PERSON]9 reported on [DATE] 24, [ORGANIZATION] that early data indicated dramatically disproportionate rates of [ORGANIZATION] infection and death of Native Americans. Among about 80 percent of [ORGANIZATION] state health departments that have released some racial demographic data on the impact of the coronavirus, almost half of them did not explicitly include Native Americans in their breakdowns and instead categorized them under the label other. We are a small population of people because of genocide, said PERSON25, chief research officer of [LOCATION]6. If you eliminate us in the data, we dont exist.Russian news network [LOCATION]7 reported on [ORGANIZATION]26 that since [ORGANIZATION]27, among more than 1,000 clandestine nuclear tests the [ORGANIZATION] government has conducted, 928 took [STREET] on lands of the Shoshone Aboriginal tribe, leaving [ORGANIZATION]60,000 tons of radioactive dust. The amount of radioactive dust is nearly 48 times that of the nuclear explosion in [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5 in [ORGANIZATION]28. According to PERSON26 of [PERSON]6, more than 1,000 people of the Shoshone Aboriginal tribe have died directly from the nuclear explosion, and many people have consequently suffered from cancer. The economic divide between races continues to widen. There has been a long-term and systematic economic inequality between ethnic minority groups and the white population in [ORGANIZATION], which is manifested in various aspects such as employment and entrepreneurship, wages, and financial loans. [PERSON]5 reported on [DATE] 7, [DATE] that, according to [LOCATION]8, 48 percent of the Asian communitys estimated 615,000 unemployed were without work for [ORGANIZATION]30 through [DATE] of [DATE]. The figure surpassed the portion of long-term unemployed among jobless workers of other ethnic groups. PERSON27, executive director of [LOCATION]9 in [PERSON]7, said that Asians in [ORGANIZATION] have been racialized, steered toward jobs and industries like catering, laundries and domestic work, nursing and personal care, which are devalued, underpaid and impacted hardest during the pandemic. On [DATE], [DATE], [PERSON]5 reported on its website that a new ORG90 poll showed that 59 percent Americans do not believe racial minorities have equal job opportunities. The ORG91 reported on its website on [DATE]1, [DATE] that 27 percent of minority-owned small businesses remained closed, much higher than White-owned small businesses. White-owned startups are seven times more likely to obtain loans than Black-owned ones during [ORGANIZATION]34. Throughout the pandemic, businesses owned by people of color did not receive equitable access to federal aid, being hit harder economically.ORG29 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that around 17 percent of African American households lack basic financial services compared to 3 percent of white households. On [DATE]5, [DATE], the [PERSON]7 Times reported on its website that despite representing 19 percent of the [ORGANIZATION] population, Hispanic families hold just 2 percent of the nations total wealth. The median net worth of white families is more than five times greater than Hispanic families. Structural flaws in its system have led to increasing racial inequality in [ORGANIZATION]. On [DATE], [DATE], [PERSON]1 Special Rapporteur on minority issues [ORGANIZATION] said at the end of a [ORGANIZATION]37 visit to [ORGANIZATION] that when it comes to human rights and minorities, [ORGANIZATION] is a nation where support for slavery led to one of the worlds most brutal civil wars, where racial segregation persisted late into [ORGANIZATION]38, and where indigenous peoples experiences have for [ORGANIZATION]39 been one of dispossession, brutality and even genocide. With a legal system that is structurally set up to advantage and forgive those who are wealthier, while penalizing those who are poorer, particularly minorities, minorities such as African Americans and [ORGANIZATION] Americans in particular are crushed into a generational cycle of poverty, [ORGANIZATION] said. V. CREATING A MIGRANT CRISIS AGAINST HUMANITY The [ORGANIZATION] government has often interfered in other countries internal affairs by wielding the club of human rights. However, the policy of separating migrant children from their families has severely endangered the migrants lives, dignity, freedom and other human rights. The migrant and refugee crisis has even been used as an instrument for American partisan attacks and political strife. Constant government policy changes and police brutality adds to the sufferings of the migrants who have already been subject to extended custody, cruel torture, forced labor and many other inhumane treatments. Asylum seekers are subject to police brutality. In [DATE], the humanitarian crisis continued to intensify as the southern border of [ORGANIZATION] saw an increasing inflow of migrants, and border enforcement officers used increasingly violent means to expel or prevent asylum seekers from entering the country. Data released by [ORGANIZATION] Border Patrol shows that in [DATE] [DATE], as many as 557 migrants died on the southern border of [ORGANIZATION], more than double [ORGANIZATION], hitting the highest number since records began in DATE5. [ORGANIZATION] reports say this does not reflect the dire situation on the [ORGANIZATION] southern border and the real number of migrant deaths may be greater. The [PERSON]5 website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that from [DATE] to [DATE] [DATE], there have been more than 7,647 publicly reported cases of murder, rape, torture, kidnapping and other violent assaults against asylum seekers. In [ORGANIZATION]49 [DATE], more than 15,000 asylum seekers from [PERSON]8 crowded under a bridge in the [ORGANIZATION]0 border town of [PERSON]9, sleeping in squalid tents or dirt in the sweltering heat, and surrounded by trash under dire living conditions. [ORGANIZATION] border patrol authorities brutalized the asylum seekers, with patrols on horseback, brandishing horsewhips and charging towards the crowds to expel them into the river. The footage of the scene immediately sparked outrage when they were released.ORG29 commented that this scene is reminiscent of the dark era in American history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves. [ORGANIZATION]1 commented that there were the outrageous images of agents on horseback herding the migrants like cattle and the [ORGANIZATION] government in general always seems to say the right things on racial issues, but too often their deeds come up short when measured against their talk. Facing a flood of criticism, the [ORGANIZATION] government soon forcibly deported thousands of asylum seekers back to [PERSON]8, most of whom had not lived there for [ORGANIZATION]42 since the [ORGANIZATION]43 earthquake in [PERSON]8. On [DATE], [DATE], the [PERSON]1 Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism and ORG95 issued a statement, condemning the systematic and mass deportation of [PERSON]8an refugees and migrants by [ORGANIZATION] without assessing the individuals situation was a violation of international law, the mass deportations seemingly continue a history of racialized exclusion of Black [PERSON]8an migrants and refugees at [ORGANIZATION] ports of entry. Dissatisfied with the [ORGANIZATION] governments inhumane handling of [PERSON]8an migrants and refugees, PERSON29, the [ORGANIZATION] special envoy for [PERSON]8, resigned in anger after [ORGANIZATION]45 in office. Immigrant children face prolonged detention and abuse. And while [PERSON] has officially ended [ORGANIZATION]0 policy of family separation, his use of Title 42 has created family separation 2.0, [PERSON]5 website reported on [DATE], [DATE]. It forced many minors to separate from their parents. There are more than 5,000 unaccompanied children in [ORGANIZATION] ORG98 custody, ORG29 reported on [DATE] 23, [DATE]. Many of them have been staying in custody for longer than the [TIME] limit set by federal law, it added. A stash of redacted documents released to the human rights group [PERSON] after [ORGANIZATION]46 of legal tussles uncover more than 160 cases of misconduct and abuse by leading government agencies, notably ORG98 and [ORGANIZATION] Border Patrol, [PERSON]9 reported on [DATE], [DATE]. The papers record events between [ORGANIZATION]63 and [DATE] that range from child sexual assault to enforced hunger, threats of rape and brutal detention conditions. Conditions in private detention facilities where migrants are held are poor. Most of the detention facilities in [ORGANIZATION] are built and operated by private companies. In order to reduce operating costs and maximize profits, private companies generally build in accordance with the minimum standards contracted with the government, resulting in poor detention facilities and a harsh internal environment. A lack of supervision has led to chaotic management of the detention facilities and repeated violations of human rights, while detainees suffered varying degrees of physical and mental health damage.[ORGANIZATION] authorities detained more than 1.7 million migrants along the GPE40 border during the [DATE] [DATE] that ended in [ORGANIZATION]49. Among them, up to 80 percent are held in private detention facilities, including 45,000 children. Conditions were deteriorating inside the emergency intake shelter erected in the harsh desert of FAC3 [ORGANIZATION]0, reported ORG99 on [DATE], [DATE]. There were nearly 5,000 children there, and some 1,500 children are still being held at the troubled site, where conditions in jam-packed tents resembled a stockyard, were traumatizing and risky for the childrens health and safety, according to half a dozen current and former workers, volunteers and civil servants, as well as internal emails obtained by ORG99. Many immigrants are victims of human trafficking and forced labor in [ORGANIZATION]. Tighter [ORGANIZATION] immigration policies, combined with weak supervision at home, have exacerbated human smuggling and labor trafficking targeting immigrants. A report by ORG6 on [DATE]0, [DATE] said that for [ORGANIZATION]52, immigrants who smuggled into the [ORGANIZATION] have been forced to work long hours on farms, living in filthy, overcrowded trailers, lacking food and clean drinking water, and facing threats of violence from regulators. The workers IDs and travel documents were withheld, which limits their ability to seek help to escape their predicament. A human trafficking indictment released on [DATE], [DATE] on the website of [ORGANIZATION] Department of Justice documents that dozens of workers from GPE40 and Central American countries have been smuggled to farms in the southern part of the state of [ORGANIZATION]6, where they were illegally imprisoned under inhumane conditions as contract agricultural laborers, becoming victims of [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] slavery. After being cheated into farms with the promise of an [TIME] salary of 12 [ORGANIZATION] dollars, they were required to dig onions with their bare hands, paid 20 cents for each bucket harvested, and threatened with guns and violence to keep them in line. At least two of the workers died as a result of workplace conditions and one suffered from multiple sexual assault. [ORGANIZATION]1 website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that hundreds of workers from GPE41 were lured to [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]2, GPE43, GPE44, [PERSON]7 etc. with the promise of fair pay and good hours, but instead they had nearly no time off from work that was grueling and frequently dangerous, moving stones that weighed several tons and facing health risks from exposure to harmful dust and chemicals. The workers were confined to their living quarters and had their passports confiscated, and were also threatened with retaliation, said the report. Exclusion of immigrants becomes more and more extreme. The immigration policy, that is wavering, inconsistent and often disregards human rights, is the main cause of border crisis and immigrants tragedy. The situation reflects that the policy is deeply affected by extreme xenophobia. According to an article published by [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION]54, with domestic debates in the [ORGANIZATION] over immigration increasingly driven by racialized resentment, anti-immigrant sentiment and entangled with domestic political battles, [ORGANIZATION] policymakers are more inclined to use techniques like force and coercion when resettling refugees. According to another article on [ORGANIZATION] published on [ORGANIZATION]55 [ORGANIZATION]56, more than 1.7 million immigrants were detained by the [ORGANIZATION] Border Patrol along the southern border during the [DATE] [DATE], soaring to the highest level since [ORGANIZATION]57. The [ORGANIZATION] government hopes to deter illegal border crossing through tough law enforcement, which has made it more difficult for illegal immigrants to enter the country, resulting in them being forced to cross more dangerous areas. The situation in turn creates a larger humanitarian crisis. VI. ABUSE OF FORCE AND SANCTIONS VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS IN OTHER CO[PERSON]1TRIES The [ORGANIZATION] has always pursued hegemonism, unilateralism and interventionism. The country frequently uses force, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties. Its abusive use of unilateral sanctions has caused humanitarian crises, challenging justice with hegemony, trampling on righteousness with self-interest, and wantonly violating human rights in other countries. It has become the biggest obstacle and destroyer of the sound development of the international human rights cause. The website of [PERSON]5 commented on [DATE], [DATE] that the [ORGANIZATION] withdrawal from [PERSON] was a total disaster. Tragedies like the [ORGANIZATION] withdrawal from [PERSON] and GPE45 show that [PERSON] has a history of ignoring basic humanitarianism for its own selfish ends. In the chaos at GPE46 [INSTITUTION], a [ORGANIZATION] C-17 transport plane forcibly took off regardless of the safety of Afghan civilians, with someone crushed to death in wheel well while the plane retracting landing gear, and others falling to their deaths from the air. Even in [TIME] of the frantic evacuation, [ORGANIZATION] armys air strikes caused heavy civilian casualties. However, the [ORGANIZATION] Defense Department publicly said that no [ORGANIZATION] military personnel would be punished for the deaths of civilians in drone strikes. The [ORGANIZATION] war on terror has killed millions of people. Since [ORGANIZATION]59, [ORGANIZATION] has launched a series of global foreign military operations in the name of anti-terrorism, resulting in nearly one million deaths. The website of [PERSON]5 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the so-called anti-terrorism war launched by [ORGANIZATION] in DATE51 has claimed the lives of more than 929,000 people, according to the costs of war study by [ORGANIZATION]04 of [ORGANIZATION]05. The [ORGANIZATION]61 [ORGANIZATION] military operations in [PERSON] have killed 174,000 people, including more than 30,000 civilians, and injured more than 60,000 people. [ORGANIZATION]1 reported on [DATE]8, [DATE] that investigation found that more than 50,000 [ORGANIZATION] airstrikes in GPE47, GPE48 and [PERSON] were reckless and poorly targeted, killing tens of thousands of civilians. The military has been concealing the number of casualties, and the actual number of civilian deaths is much higher than the militarys published figures. The most obvious case is the [ORGANIZATION] airstrike on the GPE48n hamlet of GPE49 in [ORGANIZATION]63. The military claimed that about seven to 24 civilians intermixed with the fighters might have died, but the [ORGANIZATION] military actually attacked private houses and more than 120 innocent civilians were killed. The ongoing war and instability have made nearly a third of the Afghan population refugees. A total of 3.5 million Afghans have been displaced by the conflict, and nearly 23 million face extreme hunger, including 3.2 million children under [ORGANIZATION]64. When [ORGANIZATION] withdrew its troops from [PERSON], it immediately froze billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves at the Afghan central Bank, causing the Afghan economy to be on the brink of collapse and making life worse for the people. According to an assessment by the [PERSON]1 Food and Agriculture Organization and [ORGANIZATION]07 which was released [DATE] [DATE], only 5 percent of Afghans receive enough food on a [DATE] basis. [ORGANIZATION]1 reported that [ORGANIZATION] national defense contractors were the real winners in the war on terror and that [ORGANIZATION] 20 [ORGANIZATION]52 in [PERSON] really built not a country but more than 500 military bases and the personal wealth of those who supplied them. Only about 12 percent of the reconstruction aid [ORGANIZATION] provided from [ORGANIZATION] to [DATE] actually went to the Afghan government, with most of the rest going to American companies like [ORGANIZATION]08. The [ORGANIZATION]09 website of [PERSON]0 published an article titled How [ORGANIZATION] Destroyed GPE47 on [DATE], [DATE], saying that inadequate food supply and inflation have left [LOCATION] chronically hungry. As a result of the damage to power plants and water treatment facilities caused by [ORGANIZATION] bombings, the number of people suffering from diarrhoeal diseases was four times higher than pre-war level. The lack of medicine and medical equipment has left GPE47s health system in crisis, with the poor, children, widows, the elderly and other most vulnerable groups suffering the most. Unilateral sanctions affect negatively people of other countries. [ORGANIZATION]1, [PERSON]1 Special Rapporteur on Negative Impact of Unilateral Coercive Measures on Human Rights, highlighted the sanctions devastating impact on all of [LOCATION] population, as well as on their enjoyment of human rights. The [ORGANIZATION] sanctions on Irans oil sector have resulted in Irans inability to import sufficient medical supplies, affecting the Iranians right to life and health. The [ORGANIZATION] embargoes against GPE48 have severely affected the GPE48n peoples enjoyment of economic, social, and cultural rights. On [DATE], [DATE], the [PERSON]1 General Assembly voted in favor of a resolution for [ORGANIZATION]69 to call on [ORGANIZATION] to end embargo on [PERSON]1 and start dialogue to improve bilateral ties with the country. [PERSON]1n Foreign Minister [ORGANIZATION]2 said [ORGANIZATION] continues to impose the embargo and sanctions against [PERSON]1 in the face of [ORGANIZATION], causing huge losses to the [PERSON]1n economy and society, and the [PERSON]1n people are suffering from the harm caused by this extremely inhumane act. Economic embargo is a massive, flagrant and unacceptable violation of the human rights of the [PERSON]1n people and like the virus, the blockade asphyxiates and kills, it must stop, he added. The [LOCATION] prison has been the scene of repeated torture scandals. On [DATE], [DATE], a group of 16 [PERSON]1 experts said many of the remaining detainees are vulnerable and now elderly individuals whose physical and mental integrity has been compromised by unending deprivation of freedom and related physical and psychological torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The experts, including [PERSON]1 promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, are part of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]11 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that [ORGANIZATION] still holds 39 people at [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION]3, a former detainee there, publicly revealed for the first time the torture he suffered, including being beaten, given forced [PERSON], sexually assaulted, starved, and deprived of sleep. I thought I was going to die, he said, I would beg them to stop. He said he was suspended naked from a ceiling beam for long periods, doused repeatedly with ice water to keep him awake for [ORGANIZATION]71. He described having his head held under water to the point of near drowning. The independent panel of experts on human rights appointed by the [PERSON]1 Human Rights Council issued a statement on [ORGANIZATION]72, saying that [ORGANIZATION]73 of practicing arbitrary detention without trial accompanied by torture or ill treatment violates international human right laws, and is a stain on the [ORGANIZATION] governments commitment to the rule of law. Despite forceful, repeated and unequivocal condemnation of the operation of this horrific detention and prison complex, [ORGANIZATION] continues to detain persons many of whom have never been charged with any crime, the experts said. The experts urged the [ORGANIZATION] to close the [LOCATION] prison. They also called for reparations to be made for tortured and arbitrarily detained prisoners, and for those who authorized and engaged in torture to be held accountable, as required under international law."
