,homeless,"So how are we going to continue to offer the services, [INSTITUTION] included?  to all of these people who don't have anything when we don't have anything coming in and so there's a lot more to that discussion but i would just ask those two right now because uh i think we're you know in a crunch for time right now",south bend

And then exploring the startup of a land bank to really figure out how we can address not just dilapidated houses, but vacant lots that are in the community and looking to partner with a community partner on a land bank.  on the the second priority of safe community uh lots and lots of conversation around violence reduction and and uh recruiting and retention at [ORGANIZATION] um so ensuring the safety of residents by providing necessary resources reviewing the data on gvi and violent crime reduction um really looking at violence sort of from a holistic perspective and then also looking at our homeless residents and figuring out how we can really implement have  uh document and implement a a sustainable plan for addressing homelessness um and so the [LOCATION] budget continues to and expands actually investment in violence intervention programs through ORG2 both on the operational level by adding two staff members by continuing the investment in the save team and can and actually expanding the amount of resources available for violence reduction initiatives through the arp the total of all of those being about 1.8 million  um expanding investment into public safety technology to help the [ORGANIZATION] provide new and innovative ways and [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] provide new and innovative ways to keep to keep our residents safe and then on homelessness um having a really actually a historic investment in homelessness we talked about that in the context of the [ORGANIZATION] budget that it was a historic investment in homelessness we're continuing that in the [LOCATION] budget and then  adding to it with proposed partnerships with the county on homelessness and mental health initiatives to take care of everyone in the community. On the infrastructure side, as the mayor said, I don't think that there's been this much money available for infrastructure in [DATE].",south bend
,affordable housing,"But that piece was not, I don't know all that went into that, but I think where we can get scattered site supportive housing units, I mean, the goal is to decentralize.  a lot of this and so that there's not any one built up issue or compounding issues by having you know more density in terms of these individuals  We're also working with [ORGANIZATION], who have agreed to offer at least five permanent supportive housing units. So that's all recent work to try to get some of these long-term solutions moving and get more permanent shelter options for our unsheltered population. At the same time, the city entered into arrangements that, again, were unprecedented with the formation of the FAC0 building over there by [PERSON] as a weather amnesty site.",south bend

And other organizations are stepping up [ORGANIZATION] to provide additional options, given the pandemic and the protocols that are required. Then the county undertook a motels program to build off of the program established by ORG3 anonymous donors.",south bend

ORG2 ruled that this type of eviction violates the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, is considered cruel and unusual punishment. Okay.",south bend

And as things have morphed over [LOCATION], it's become more challenging to do that. But we have instituted what I think is a very exciting component of our plan, and that is a community land trust.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"My question is more, is the city taking a look and trying to identify why people are homeless and to try to implement solutions to prevent homelessness other than actually providing housing? Yeah, so I think the creation of the implementation group was definitely speaking to prevention and intervention as well. And so those conversations have been had within our conversations in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION].",south bend
,homeless,"But we'll know how this opening is going in relative short order. So that's where we are and we continue to work with our health officials and [ORGANIZATION] and our partners in the county to increase testing, contact tracing, and the pieces that are going to help us contain further outbreaks without having to resort to stay at home or more extreme separation or isolation measures. I know the issue of our chronic homeless population has become front and center, especially [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,And it makes the job for the service providers and those of us that try to serve the homeless in our community a little bit easier to know that there are a number of folks that are being employed and that you obviously provide a great deal of care for these individuals.

It's more complicated so we can talk about that in the mediation but ultimately is the encampment outside of somebody's house gone at the end? No, it's not.

2024-02-14,homelessness,"I am the new [ORGANIZATION] inspector general heading the offiof the inspector general, and as it was stated I'm here to present our proposed [ORGANIZATION] budget and I will start with telling you a little about [ORGANIZATION]. Basically, [ORGANIZATION] voters passed proposition d in [ORGANIZATION] establishing the [ORGANIZATION] first sheriff department oversight board, and that board proceeded to create the office of the inspector general and the whole purpose of the inspector general's office is provide independent oversight of the sheriff office. We have been assigned the government code or department code, sda to [ORGANIZATION]. The ORG2, roles and responsibilities are defined and [ORGANIZATION] charter section 4.137. then our oversight board appointed myself, [ORGANIZATION] as inspector general and on [LOCATION] we had a very beautiful administration of the oath by the legendary former mayor [PERSON] and [PERSON] which was created for oversight of the [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] continues to provide support of the ORG2 operation and assisting us with our independent investigations basically until we are fully staffed and up and running. Now, our role and responsibilities. We conduct the investigations of complaints filed against [ORGANIZATION] sheriff office employees and that includes the deputy sheriffs and their civilian employees and any third party contractors that they contract with. We also handle the investigations of any individual who dies while in the custody of the sheriff department. Additionally, once we conduct our investigations we also recommend disciplinary action to the sheriff. In terms of policies, what we are really looking to do is assist the sheriff department. We are also assisting with the development and recommending use of force policies for the sheriff department. We also look at the writing-reporting and auditing so we track and report on investigations, recommendations and outcomes and we monitor the sheriff office operations to insure compliance with the laws and policies. and we also conduct hearings. Most of those hearings roget right now are conducted by the oversight board but we have there authority to issue subpoena, administer oath, and take testimony. Now, our budget priorities. Well, our budget priorities are to recruit, hire, onboard and train staff because we are a new agency and so this is going to be one of our primary purposes getting the agency up and running. We also are tasked with developing policies and procedures, requesting positions to meet our charter mandate. And what do we need? We need investigators to investigate our sheriff office cases. We also need a senior investigator to investigate review investigations and manage the sheriff department cases. Basically the senior investigator will supervise the investigators that are conducting the individual investigations. We have a assistant chief attorney who's really responsible for helping process public records requests to review and support investigations before they come to my desk, draft agreements and just assist with the overall running of the office of the inspector general. And of course we have a executive secretary that in addition to many roles also processes payroll and purchasing and provide administrative support. what is the proposed budget for the [ORGANIZATION] budget? We are here [ORGANIZATION] to present that at this public meeting. When looking at the budget we first wanted to look at the mayor's budget instructions and so what is the primary focus of the mayor's budget for [PERSON] and one is to improve public safety and the [STREET] conditions of [ORGANIZATION]. To promote city wide economic vitality and that goes hand in hand with public safety and [STREET] conditions. Reduce homelessness and transform mental health services. Mental health service delivery and just increasing the overall accountability, equity and spending of the budget. Now, this last section is very important because we are in [PERSON], and so all departments of [ORGANIZATION] are being asked to reduce their general fund support by 10% and through [ORGANIZATION]-through [LOCATION], DATE8, with also a possible additional 5% contingency you [DATE] be asked to reduce your budget so we could be looking at most departments a 15% budget reduction. With that in mind and being a new agency, we understood is we will probably given the difficult budget cycle that we are in, we are going to have to do a phased growth of [ORGANIZATION], so instead of asking for everything that we need to be an agency up and running, we understand we will have to phase the growth of our agency. Right now we are-we looked at what is the basic amount of funding we need to get up and running? We propose 2 mill $22.163.632. We feel that request allows to bring in the number of employees to get up and running independently as a agency. Because we are being asked to take a 10% cut, that cut is reflected in the $353.080 will amount to the cut we are taking out of our budget, which would leave at the proposed $2.163.632. Now, for the number of employees, our basic proposed budget we have 13 employees, and with the 10% cut, we would lose one of those employees so it would leave us at 12 employees under the current request for funding. And so what does that 10% look like? I told we would lose one employee that would be a investigator and also our non personal service amount to about $40 thousand leaving total of $221 thousand that reflect in the 10% reduction. We also have work orders because we are not able to fully-we are not fully funded at this point because we are a new agency,b then we have to rely on [LOCATION] to support our agency-excuse me, [ORGANIZATION] to support our agency with technology that will come in the form of about $62 thousand. We also would need accounting service from the [ORGANIZATION] controller's office, $53 thousand and investigative and administrative support, $480 thousand, and because we don't have our own in-house hr department, the county is providing us the hr rep and that will amount to $147 thousand. Now, what is the-our proposed budget is where we are requesting the funding, but we understand we had to pull back in [ORGANIZATION]. We are proposing that we are not asking for any increases in materials and supplies. We are not asking for any increases in non-personnel services. And not asking for any increases in salaries and benefits. We are really trying to work within the scope of understanding that we are in a difficult budget time, but at the same time, asking for the minimum of what we need to get our agency up and running and as a result we'll be relying heavily on the [ORGANIZATION] to support us and that will be in the form of $747 thousand. That will allow us to operate as the office of the inspector general. What are the impact of the reductions? Because we are not able to be a fully operational agency at this point given the budget constrictions, what is the impact of those reductions? Well, the original budget did not include funds for central personnel and infrastructure to meet the charter mandates, so these reductions will extend our reliance on borrowed support from the [ORGANIZATION], it will delay our ability to become fully operations and impair our ability to meet our core requirements laid out by the charter, 4.137. And it will also prevent our office from adding services for the community. And with that, if there are any questions, I'm very open to answering questions or ts anyone [DATE] have.
