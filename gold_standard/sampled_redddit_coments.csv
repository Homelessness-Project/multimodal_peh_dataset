'Suckers' for panhandling? - ORG0 story about the recent explosion of panhandling in our area.,16,"If the city did not want this, they would not have dedicated half of the downtown area to homeless shelters.

'Suckers' for panhandling? - ORG0 story about the recent explosion of panhandling in our area.,16,"I know the corner of  [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] is one of the corners this guy apparently has people 'working.' The corner is always covered and it seems to rotate through a few of the same individuals, almost as if the are on shifts. I haven't heard much more than that, but I have heard the same thing from various people who work with homeless and/or addicts. I don't personally provide direct services or work with clients anymore so I haven't heard it myself but I trust those I have heard it from. Some were talking about trying to alert media or police to it but not sure that anyone has enough information to work with. ",3,southbend
[ORGANIZATION] mayor not backing jobs proposal for panhandlers,4,"Not a big surprise?

There is not a lack of low paying jobs here. The top needs of the panhandlers is usually mental care, which we as a society really suck at providing. Giving someone with a substance abuse problem or a mental disorder a trashbag and $10 an hour to pick up trash isn't going to do a lot.",8,southbend
[ORGANIZATION] mayor not backing jobs proposal for panhandlers,4,"Good call [ORGANIZATION]. Many, not all, of the panhandlers don't want a job. A great deal of them are former residents of FAC0 in town. They are usually out there begging for money to pay for their addiction and put money in their dealers hand.

I believe a better option is to take any money that could have gone to this and continue to provide low cost housing for the truly homeless. Couple that with finding a [STREET] to get more mental health facilities in town would go a longer [STREET] than jobs for these people.",4,southbend
Panhandlers now going door to door in [ORGANIZATION],7,"Not really a new thing. When I lived in that area [ORGANIZATION], we'd have panhandlers come to our door a few times a month.",4,southbend

All of the hard work and money spent on FAC0 is going down the drain,6,"I experience the same comments with non-benders in my car. It's tough because we want [ORGANIZATION] to be better, and there's been large improvements. But there is still a [ORGANIZATION] of work to be done. At this point, I feel as if the homeless issue is starting to hold back development and other progress in the city, mainly downtown. I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for [ORGANIZATION]. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge. The bread of butter of Democrats is poor relief. Is the current situation a result of the current (local) administration/leaders? I mean, this doesn't happen overnight and is really a product of issues that effect the entire [PERSON] (is [ORGANIZATION] the only or select few with this problem? No). But here we are, with this issue in our laps. It doesn't matter so much as to how they got here. The real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self sufficient. There has been proven success with the housing first model. We don't have the capital to overnight the project and get results right away, so we are left in a holding pattern waiting for the first units to come online and gather data on how that works for us. 

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] to step in. They have some of the brightest individuals there, that could use their resesrch expertise, and other knowledge to come with up with a collaborative approach with the City of [ORGANIZATION] to help tackle this problem the right [STREET]. I've always thought [ORGANIZATION] should be a little more involved with [ORGANIZATION], and I don't see why this issue would be any different. ORG2 benefits from a better [ORGANIZATION].

[ORGANIZATION] a DATE0 Homeless Man,0,"It's because you're just some [ORGANIZATION] who posted ""SB Cops Murdered a [DATE] [PERSON]"" along with a link to a local TV news story that doesn't at all support that inflammatory claim at this point. It comes across as something an angry teenager would post.",6,southbend
[ORGANIZATION] officials invoke sex offenders to oppose [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION],24,It’s either build the center and have all of the people you’re so worried about in one [STREET] or have them out on the streets not getting the mental help they need. The people you’re afraid of are someone’s daughter/son/mother/father. Every time I see someone saying this is a bad idea I see someone who has not a lick of common sense. If this falls through I can’t wait to see the complaints about all the homeless people on the streets crowding your beautiful city.,47,southbend
[ORGANIZATION] officials invoke sex offenders to oppose [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION],24,"There are several reasons that someone couldn't stay at center for the homeless but could be at [ORGANIZATION].
Some are innocuous, such for example, [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow pets, but [ORGANIZATION] does. [ORGANIZATION] is sex segregated so couples can't stay there together, but they can at [ORGANIZATION]. 

But the other big distinction is that [ORGANIZATION] isn't a low barrier shelter, so they have a strick drugs and alcohol policy, which [ORGANIZATION] does not. I'm pretty sure that [ORGANIZATION] also requires residents to participate in mental health and job counseling, which [ORGANIZATION] for now does not.",9,southbend
Homeless folks and FAC0 downtown,13,"[ORGANIZATION] definitely knows the population visiting the main branch includes a significant number of people experiencing homelessness! One of the great things they do is partner with [ORGANIZATION] to make 3 free meals a day available to anyone.

Homeless folks and FAC0 downtown,13,"I just wanted to chime in that I think your question is so so so valid and I am glad you asked it. When you haven’t been around people experiencing active homelessness and potentially untreated mental health issues it can be scary at first bc let’s be real… all the unknown things and situations in our lives are scary for the most part- positive or negative. I am relieved to see all the posts on here educating and in support of giving humans a meal, electricity, and even a space to feel safe when they barely feel safe with their own thoughts. The library is doing a beautiful thing and if it truly bothers you that much that you refuse to go to the downtown location I think you really should just be grateful you have the option and resources to [STREET] 5 miles to the next library. And, I mean that genuinely. My husband experienced someone who was suffering from severe mental health issues in front of the library not too long ago and he decided from now on he wanted to go to a further away one. To each their own. Even if it’s your own husband 🤓",1,southbend
[INSTITUTION] on FAC0 now on hold,17,"I’ve said before. Have it in the middle of [ORGANIZATION]. That’s where most of the supporters who would help the homeless are.

Don’t know why they want it so far away",8,southbend
[INSTITUTION] on FAC0 now on hold,17,"Yeah, anywhere a new [INSTITUTION] is built within the city it’s going to be near some residences and businesses, and until someone is willing to take a risk to change the situation by at least letting a new shelter try within walking distance of them nothing will improve. And if you could get those who object to be totally honest, many would prefer the homeless to either be in prison or dead over being anywhere near their neighborhood or business.",8,southbend

[ORGANIZATION] building 22-unit apartment complex to house the homeless,63,"Most comments are saying how great it is to homeless (and it usually is) but are ignoring or unaware of the ***type*** of homeless they plan to [STREET] here.  *Drug addicts and people with mental issues.*  If it were more homes for homeless and/or low income families, I wouldn't think twice about it but I'm very concerned about a facility housing drug addicts and people with mental issues just a couple hundred feet from a school in the middle of a residential neighborhood.",1,southbend
[ORGANIZATION] building 22-unit apartment complex to house the homeless,63,"Hey neighbor, I live over here as well! 

I share a lot of your concerns, but we have to remember that this needs to go *somewhere*. Its probably going to have a negative impact wherever it goes, it just happens we drew the short straw this time. I already sent an email to [ORGANIZATION] (and I should probably send one to [PERSON] as well) requesting some more specifics on what the plan is to maintain the neighborhood. Id suggest you do the same. The more pressure, the better. When this happens, because it certainly sounds like its going to, we are going to have to try to make the most of it. We will have a vested interest in making sure the residents there succeed and receive the resources they are promised. We will also need to make sure we hold the city's feet to the fire to make sure they fulfill their promises to us and maintain our neighborhood. 

Thankfully this is a little different than a soup kitchen or shelter. Its actual housing, its designed for people who are maybe one step up from living on the streets, but still one step down from being on their feet enough to live in someplace like FAC0. Im genuinely hoping and cautiously optimistic that it wont be much of a problem.",3,southbend
"Homeless Camp Near Downtown GPE0 Asked To Disperse, Results In Protest",28,"There have been polls taken from people living under the viaduct, around downtown, etc. in [ORGANIZATION] showing that they won’t accept city help, either because they prefer living homeless or don’t trust the government, or both. I don’t know how a city is supposed to help these people, it seems like a lost cause. Mayor [PERSON] would even go to the homeless encampments In Person and talk to those living there - even with personal persuasion, he couldn’t get people to not want to live under that viaduct.

The truth is, [LOCATION] does have a lot of resources and options relative to our city size - it’s just a lot of homeless refuse to use them.",13,southbend
"Amid cries and curses, [ORGANIZATION] votes down [ORGANIZATION] administration's plan for homeless apartments",31,"The meeting was a great showing of varying community opinion. Went from [TIME].

\- PERSON0 got truly irate

\- PERSON1 (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information [ORGANIZATION] night to council. [TIME] before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side? You going to find many free multiple acre properties in [PERSON]'s district?",19,southbend
"Amid cries and curses, [ORGANIZATION] votes down [ORGANIZATION] administration's plan for homeless apartments",31,"Yeah on my phone and trying to figure out how to share a [ORGANIZATION]. It's 20-22 units, they have leases, and some pay a small portion of rent but not usually. Originally (DATE0) it was a part time maintenance person, [TIME] a week apt/community manager, and [TIME] a week for a off-duty cop. RA may live on site but they would have to go to the state for approval, likely be difficult, and not in plans currently.

There would be on site visits from [ORGANIZATION] (recovery coach) but for their caseworker it sounds like they would pick up individuals and bring them to [ORGANIZATION]. Same for mental health and addiction services.  [ORGANIZATION] would have 2 case managers available, not solely dedicated. The homeless individual has the choice to participate.

Questions for the NIMBYs concerning [PERSON] Now,72,"I’ve lived downtown for [ORGANIZATION] and see homeless people sleeping in my parking lot on benches, setting up tents by the river and sleeping, just trying to be comfortable somewhere. I think it is ridiculous to act like providing homeless people housing would somehow increase crime when we know that evidence shows providing stable living environments brings DOWN crime. I would much rather live next door to a housing facility for the homeless than continue to see people sleeping on the bare ground. The same people who complain about the amount of homeless people are the same ones who complain whenever the city does anything to try to assist them. It’s ridiculous. we shouldn’t listen to these people because they will complain no matter what because at [DATE], they just like to look down on others",16,southbend
Questions for the NIMBYs concerning [PERSON] Now,72,"Thanks for your thoughtful response. 

I'm curious how large complexes are more harmful? And I also thought [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow visitors or drugs. Maybe a safe injection site is also needed so people aren't shooting up in people's yards. I think it was a little misguided that the director of [ORGANIZATION] said homelessness was done for with [ORGANIZATION] running. 

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage. The county commissioners don't want to fund anything that isn't already a running program or a giant corporation trying to move in. [ORGANIZATION] didn't even pay attention to the meeting, just got the [INSTITUTION] to shut things down(there were clearly too many people, but that was an observation I had). Honestly if [ORGANIZATION] stops getting funded by the county I'm all down for camping in [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] till he changes his mind.",5,southbend

[ORGANIZATION] wants to jump from political operative to mayor who builds pride in [ORGANIZATION],4,"I like some of his ideas but I have a better chance being a pro basketball player than [ORGANIZATION] does consolidating departments or initiatives with [PERSON]. Him thinking that's possible makes me question if he's just saying that to get away with the ""how will you pay for this"" question than it either shows willful misleading or not understanding the dynamic between the two cities.

He seems to be trying to be the best of both worlds and say ""hey if you like [ORGANIZATION] and where the city is going I'm your guy but also hey [ORGANIZATION] is overrated and the city needs a lot of work"" it's an interesting strategy. I think he actually has a more critical view of [ORGANIZATION] and the city government than he let's on (which there is nothing wrong with) that I wish he would just come out in the open and say so the debate could be better.

Edit - For example it's easy to say the city is ""screwing around"" with the homeless situation, but to not give what you would actually so different. The city had a decent homeless initiative that was stopped by residents in unison saying you're not putting transition centers in ""my neighborhood"". So how do you get past that? What is he going to do to fix the problem besides, say, not screwing around? Whatever that even means. Considering it's a top 3 initiative of his, he's provided no details whatsoever. 

He wants it all by saying, hey if you like the current administration, vote for me! But also says people are quote ""disenchanted"" with development downtown, the two don't really square up.",8,southbend

Questions for the NIMBYs concerning [PERSON] Now,72,"So, I've changed a lot on this one over time. I spent [ORGANIZATION] as an advocate working against chronic homelessness, have participated on some of the city's [LOCATION] on homelessness, etc, but I don't think the city, nor this take are being entirely generous.

1 - yes, housing first is scientifically the most effective model for caring for the homeless. It's math, not feelings. It [LOCATION] - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the [ORGANIZATION] side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a [STREET] that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.

Questions for the NIMBYs concerning [PERSON] Now,72,"It’s SOP for this area (and maybe the world), wait until [TIME] and then scream NO. In this case, not “here”.

Full disclosure - I dont live near either location. 

I honestly dont care where they put it. There’s more than three acres available a quarter mile from where I live they could use. But I’m not on the bus route and neither is that land. If there was a bus route into [ORGANIZATION], I’d suggest putting it there.

I lived on FAC0 for DATE0. Had plenty of homeless stop by when I was working in the yard asking for handouts or offering to work for money.

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"The volunteering has bothered me for quite a while like you said, these people cannot even feed let  alone house themselves yet they’re down there donating their time which could be better spent looking for a job. Now the situation is so dire that a food train is needed to feed these volunteers. Again, wouldn’t they be better served finding a job? The thing that mainly bothers me, though is the pictures and the videos. We’re talking about people who are in the throes of their addiction, in the middle of detoxing, or fresh out of rehab or suffering from mental illness . Of course if she asked them to take a picture of video they’re going to say yes, they feel obligated to say yes, would be my guess, some of them probably feel like if they don’t say yes, she won’t help them, or they won’t be able to be down there ,or worse be ostracized once again in their lives. . She is a master manipulator and things don’t have to be said, in order to be understood.  Don’t get me started on the children’s picture being blasted out there. For instance, the last one with [ORGANIZATION] and her husband/abuser/trafficker and those poor kids. Now of course they will consent to a picture, because after all [PERSON] saved them!  And it makes complete sense for all their friends and strangers to know the horrors these children endured before their parents got clean. Lastly no one and I mean NO one should be cleaning up a person who has soiled themselves.

City of [ORGANIZATION] attempting to shut down Miss [PERSON]'s,54,"Pretty strong rhetoric here. [ORGANIZATION] administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people [ORGANIZATION]. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes. I hope that you can make the adjustments required for you to continue helping people in a [STREET] that's safe, and I hope that you're able to continue to increase what you do for the community. I do understand that it's not an easy thing to have to deal with, but lashing out at the city is not the solution.

A church dropped off around 1,000 sandwiches, other people brought [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] chips, chili, and there were 3 huge totes of [ORGANIZATION] gifts from a church.  Then, she mentioned she has brain farts and can’t remember people’s names since she has had too many overdoses. She talks about how you can’t see all her homeless people out and about since they are so resourceful and know how to hide.  [PERSON], abandoned houses, railroad tracks.  Basically you can’t see them in her area since they are tucked away.  

So, she helped us understand she never gives people suboxone, a doctor prescribes it.  You can’t see her 1,000 people since they tuck themselves away.  And, now I know partly why ORG2 had 20,000 less pounds of food per month donated than [LOCATION].",11,rockford

Cons - the homelessness is less intense than [ORGANIZATION] or even the [PERSON] but just be careful as some of the homeless can be really aggressive. The crime has very specific hotspots and if you do your research you will know where they are. Some people on here are very sensitive about that because they'll accuse you of being classist and all that [ORGANIZATION] stuff but it is a safety issue so you don't go walking and driving into the wrong part of town at [TIME].

You overreacted to my post IMO. I'm not that important. Its just my opinion.

Honestly lots of times announcements like this lead to nowhere or we forget about it. I will agree that corruption is legalized in a lot of ways. The reality is it’s very difficult to ascertain what is going on. Is the city doing well or not? It doesn’t feel like it often but I do like the people of [ORGANIZATION] that work hard to make it work, I just don’t think that “thriving” in the [STREET] the current administration wants it to be should be the goal.

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either [STREET], but some of the comments are petty [ORGANIZATION]. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise.

Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss [ORGANIZATION] volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  [ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?

The roads are crap because you get the worst of [ORGANIZATION] being down well below 0 for [LOCATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] are well above the 90s for [LOCATION]. the springs and falls are nice but its [ORGANIZATION] of each. 

[PERSON] is also a highly industrial area, except that was [PERSON]. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for [PERSON] then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant [STREET] worth a shit. guys in [ORGANIZATION] are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every [STREET] imaginable. They also passed another granting [PERSON] to build a casino [PERSON] or DATE8.

City of [ORGANIZATION] attempting to shut down Miss [PERSON]'s,54,"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with.

What I think was strange about [PERSON]'s version was that it over-emphasized the [ORGANIZATION]'s efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, FAC0 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. FAC0 improvement project that's underway or our [ORGANIZATION] in our [ORGANIZATION] Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in [ORGANIZATION]? Triple-deckers in [PERSON]? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from [ORGANIZATION] zoning to form-based zoning. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If [PERSON] chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. [PERSON] is offering cities in [PERSON] a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the [ORGANIZATION] has not taken them up on it. 
* [ORGANIZATION] councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that [PERSON] **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it.

Where did they ship all the homeless?,482,"I’m curious, what exactly did you do to help before? I ask because, as someone formerly homeless I literally had maybe a handful of people who actually offered any kind of material help and usually it really wasn’t much.

In fact, when I was denied [ORGANIZATION] benefits for the second time because I was foolish enough to mention during the phone interview, after all the paperwork I completed and having to wait [ORGANIZATION] for the opportunity to get  1 phone call I better not miss or have to start all over, that I mentioned I sometimes would prepare and have meals with my girlfriend. And I was denied because I refused to do as they ask and go to this woman, one of the few people who actually stood by me and saw me get out of that situation, my real guardian angel, that I felt it was inappropriate for me to then have to ask her for her [ORGANIZATION], every detail of her personal finances, ask for her college transcript, take all this very detailed personal information making her vulnerable to whoever had it and turn it over to the county and state just so I could get a couple hundred a month I could use and only use making sure I, at the very least, had food in my stomach.

When I was a homeless man, asking one of the very few programs that offer any kind of help or relief just for the help of food was denied that help. And to have that be the second time of paperwork and waiting and phone interviews and then waiting some more just to find out that our system denied a working homeless person who because of pride had put off even asking for help until I realized why not her help if it’s there. That’s when I realized it actually wasn’t there.

People talk a lot about “all the things the homeless get” and as you said yourself they’re “freeloaders” without realizing that in fact most get little to anything and the ones who do get something’s had to and have to continually fight and work to keep getting anything. All while living in a constant state of stress and trauma.

The fact is, and this is a fact you can look at the numbers yourself, we spend [STREET] more money on the bureaucracy we require to deny people help than we spend on the help that we go to great lengths to make it as difficult and shameful as we possibly can make it to get. 

That woman who had that [TIME] long phone interview with me, who I’m sure is a good and kind person trying to survive like the rest of us, that woman was getting payed. And as an employee of the city and county of [ORGANIZATION] was likely making near 6 figures if not in fact 6 figures. And we as a society payed her that sum on [LOCATION] to find a reason to deny a homeless person, sober, working and struggling, we denied a homeless person food.

So, when you say you used to do what you could to help people, besides the tax dollars that are spent “helping” in the [STREET] I described above, what exactly was that help? You’d occasionally give some coins to someone to leave you alone? You’d occasionally decide not to call the police on someone who other than being unsightly was causing no other real harm or disturbance.

Because call me crazy, but I’m maybe a little suspicious of the guy saying he’d happily look the other [STREET] if the city decided to “crack some heads”  that maybe just maybe you in fact have never really been much help to the people you’re here advocating state violence against so casually and brazenly.

Something tells me you likely would do more for a stray dog then to address in any helpful or constructive [STREET] the human misery we all have to see everyday and that pieces of shit who sound an awful lot like you do do everything in their power to undermine and put requirements on which end up increasing the costs to all of our tax dollars, not just you but all the people who actually give a damn about other human beings want actually spent on just helping people the fuck out when they’re in a tight spot.

First of all, we need both - the cops we have need to do a better job of enforcing the laws, and we need more cops to cover more areas, more consistently, and to make sure there is sufficient availability for them to respond whenever a call for assistance comes in, even if it's not an immediate emergency. 

But the real issue here is something else entirely - that by a clear majority, people in this city are sick and tired of people simply being allowed to do whatever they want, wherever they want, without consequence. Not because they're not compassionate, not because they don't understand that many people who are homeless truly got there through no fault of their own or that most of us could relatively easily end up in the same situation, but because they realize that for those that struggle the most to make responsible choices, an overall approach that prioritizes permissiveness and enabling is the worst possible ""solution"" - for them and for the rest of us. 

Speaking from personal experience here - the last thing a person needs when they are finding it hard to make good choices is for someone to make it easier to make bad ones.",52,portland

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than [ORGANIZATION]. Everything from slavery to [ORGANIZATION] to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many [ORGANIZATION]. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit [ORGANIZATION] may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're [ORGANIZATION] from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that [STREET] because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard [ORGANIZATION].
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among [ORGANIZATION], those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the [STREET] they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",45,buffalo

I have a DATE1 degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, [ORGANIZATION] can be a great city to live in.
But the downsides are the nepotism, cold, income disparity, high rental prices, lack of reasonable bus system(that arrives on time or to the suburbs), [ORGANIZATION] collar/non-union).

Oh, and if you have any issues with credit good luck renting anywhere corporate. I was a unlucky individual with a awesome mother who used my info for utilities and other bills that makes renting that [STREET] near impossible.

Where can I donate a tent/other camping items to a [INSTITUTION]?,0,"And they're asking people to donate food, clothing, and baby supplies -- not tents. As a lifelong democrat, no I am not universally opposed to social programs.

The reality is that the [ORGANIZATION] could donate the tent and camping supplies to a local nonprofit that could make good use of it. This is not as flashy or righteous as giving it to LGBTQ homeless people. The best outcome is someone pops a tent on the sidewalk, neighbors and local businesses call police immediately because encampments are not normalized here, and the tent is thrown in the trash. Worst outcome is someone pops the tent on private property and they are verbally/physically threatened before their tent is thrown away.

You can empathize with the homeless and gladly pay taxes to support people. You don't have to allow encampments to spring up in public places.

I'd also push back on the idea there was no housing crisis in [LOCATION], since urban renewal efforts targeting ""overcrowded"" black neighborhoods began soon after WWII, as black renters were not allowed in many ""higher end"" (white) neighborhoods.

[ORGANIZATION] on the map for good things again! Thoughts?,12,"It's a pretty well known fact that most homeless people will try to migrate to an area that is more open/accommodating to homelessness AND that their destination has good to great weather [ORGANIZATION] round.

This is why we can't have nice things or move forward. People always be complaining. ||West [ORGANIZATION] residents seeking legal action to stop affordable housing complex.,102,"The issue is infrastructure and transportation. The whole point is to be able to have affordable housing with nearby public transportation. If you're in affordable housing, you most likely don't have a vehicle, so public transportation is going to be your main source of movement.

Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"I have not experienced 'aggression', though I do see homeless people.
