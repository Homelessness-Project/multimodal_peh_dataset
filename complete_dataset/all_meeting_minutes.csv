,homeless; unhoused,"I had originally scheduled to have the presentation from the [ORGANIZATION] program [ORGANIZATION], but due to some very unfortunate circumstances over [LOCATION],  that it had to be postponed. So now that it is official that they are cleared of any wrongdoing, and I must say that the shameful and senseless attempt at character assassination of this fine not-for-profit, as well as the upstanding individuals that run it,  is just unspeakable for a service and an asset that is so needed in this community. So I will be working to get them rescheduled to come before us, and I would ask my council colleagues to please treat them with the respect they are due for the exceptional work that they do with the homeless and the unhoused in our community.",south bend
,homeless,"Then there was, you know, some movement before then, before [ORGANIZATION] under the bridge dealing with the homeless. This council did step up and say, hey, we need to do something with [ORGANIZATION] presenting this stuff over there in [ORGANIZATION]. And there was discussion, there was some resolutions that were on before council.",south bend
,homeless,I'm not sure if they passed through or not. I don't remember that. But what I do know is that the language that was used and the ability to shame the homeless in that video by council president really set a really horrible tone.,south bend
,homeless,"And it has been substantially confirmed in the paper and in the media that people did not have running water, people did not have heat, and also it smelled like a urinal in the facility. And on top of it, while I was visiting, finding out that people were paying  rent out of homeless people, taking advantage of the disadvantage to be paying money out of their pocket on top of what the [ORGANIZATION] funds is being paid for. I was very upset about  It was a private conversation that was secretly recorded and leaked out and shared among some of my colleagues shared to different people in the community.",south bend
,homeless,"By the contents, in the context of what I said, very upsetting to see that homeless people being used by some of our own council that knew that that building was not properly zoned. For [ORGANIZATION],  did not share that information with council knowing that that facility was not zoned properly because it came before us you just keep lying painful so i",south bend
,houseless,"At this time, our invocation will be given by [ORGANIZATION], At-Large Councilwoman. Thank you, President [PERSON]. Loving God, protector of all, we ask you to watch over our city and to watch the residents of our city, our children, our seniors, those who go hungry, the houseless, the strangers and immigrants in our midst, and those who are alone, creator of good,  Thank you for the men and women who serve our city in various ways, our staff members, public safety officers, those in leadership roles.",south bend
,affordable housing,yes uh first uh mr [ORGANIZATION] i think we quickly voted and your kids got a favorable recommendation they're pretty cute [PERSON] that that uh i just want to thank uh thank mr PERSON2 for his investment in the community and uh um was mentioned by [ORGANIZATION] earlier this is uh one of the ways we get uh more housing stock and more affordable affordable housing stock in the in the city thank you  councilman PERSON4 i would just like to say to mr PERSON2 to see the difference from [ORGANIZATION] and what you've done is impressive um you know these older houses they need to love and when people invest in them they invest in our neighborhoods we appreciate that we appreciate you  taking that opportunity to invest in the neighborhood. And it's going to be more than a multifamily opportunity.,south bend
,affordable housing,"The [ORGANIZATION] near [ORGANIZATION]west neighborhood itself had tried for [ORGANIZATION] to get tax credit grants in order to turn this into affordable housing, workforce housing or elderly housing, but were unsuccessful. So what we are doing is we're proposing a market based private initiative that will allow us to renovate this building and turn it into a commercial node. What we call a collaborative village that will allow us to offer space for businesses,  retail  professional offices, makerspace, cultural arts space, as well as folks like tax accountant, insurance agents, health and wellness.",south bend
,homeless,"We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community, as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government. And lastly, fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government. All this is transparent and for the genuine improvement of the city of [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,"Okay. But on that area, one corner is the location that is on dispute right now. And the reason that we are, that I am questioning that is because we got a lot of homeless people there.",south bend
,homeless,"Yes, and after discussion with the petitioner, there was more information that he didn't quite understand and different steps that needed to be taken. So we're still going to address it now. If it's additional information and you're speaking now about the homeless,  that is a different issue than still getting an alley vacation.",south bend
,homelessness,"At that time, it was just a few organizations doing a few things. But we said we wanted to create a movement. We want women entrepreneurs to see that they are somebody, that they can build a business, that they can overcome things like domestic violence and homelessness.",south bend
,affordable housing,"That becomes the policy for the city, and we make recommendations based on those changes when new development occurs. There are other things that neighborhood plans seek to address, and housing is a big one. As you know, our department has been pretty focused on delivering new housing of all types, but specifically affordable housing as well.",south bend
,affordable housing,"We wanted to do things to make the neighborhood safer, but we didn't want to sacrifice our ethos of affordable housing. To that end, [ORGANIZATION] is going to be one quick deliverable we can offer the neighbors. Our mobile tool library is another one that we're working on right now, and working through ORG1 and other affordable housing developers to teach how to fix your own homes, and how to access the right materials, and how to work with ORG2 locally as well.",south bend
,homelessness,"Thank you so much. And I would just like to say that thank you [PERSON] and the team city administration who Helped to push this plan forward [ORGANIZATION] is but a few blocks over from the third district and definitely impact us and you guys have been doing a lot of heavy lifting over [ORGANIZATION] and  with a lot of the homelessness and crime in the area and things like that. So it is exciting to see the city moving forward with development and revitalizing neighborhoods and what better neighborhood than [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] to have, um,",south bend
,affordable housing,"We have been hoping that the near northwest neighborhood would be able to get a tax credit grant that would have allowed them to be able to  turned this into affordable housing or workforce housing, but they were never able quite to get there. And after they were unable to do it [ORGANIZATION], my partners and I came up with a plan that would allow us to do this without that kind of a tax credit group. And so now what we are doing is we're in the process of wanting to –  take this building, bring it back to life, and make it, turn it from an attractive nuisance that's been driving down property values in the neighborhood for [LOCATION] to a neighborhood attraction that will help to be an anchor for both our residential as well as reestablishment of the commercial node at this location.",south bend
,homeless,"We're a corporation representing 25 [ORGANIZATION] businesses. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community, as well as a greater fiscal responsibility from our local government. And lastly, fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government.",south bend
,homeless,All this is transparent and for the genuine improvement of the city of [ORGANIZATION]. I want to thank all of you council members except [PERSON] for meeting with us over [ORGANIZATION] to learn about our plans to protect the city from being overrun by more homeless immigrants from surrounding states and communities. We gained valuable feedback from their review of our efforts.,south bend
,homeless,We'll be down there feeding the homeless. We'll be down there passing out food to the needy. That's what we do.,south bend
,homeless,"All right, let me shoot. The first request I would ask is that if we, as the council could have the [ORGANIZATION] updates, at least [ORGANIZATION], I don't know if that would be more that you're getting with the healthcare facilities  business and the mayor's office for us to be able to share with our constituents and to be able to lead uh accordingly is the first request that i have um and some other questions uh [ORGANIZATION] tell me if i'm going too fast you're fine if there any uh communication that you've had with any of the black uh leaders or uh community as far as outreach since it's um  hitting the black community worldwide more than any other population. The second question, I want to know the update on the homeless population status that they talked about with [PERSON].",south bend
,homeless,"On the homeless, we have talked about an isolation slash quarantine facility. Initially, we had contemplated FAC0. We've decided on another facility.",south bend
,homeless,"This could be a wide variety of folks. It could be homeless who have tested positive, but it also could be somebody from your family who didn't want to come back to your house and potentially impact the other members of your family who instead will go to that. So by [ORGANIZATION], that should be up and running.",south bend
,homeless,"And then also related to communications, some questions that I'm getting as an at-large member  is frequency of either video updates or live updates, press conferences that you and the mayor may be having, and possibly a recommendation for more of those on a regular basis. And then finally, I appreciate you addressing quarantine sites for the homeless, but my question is really about if there's any conversation regarding temporary housing for the homeless during this time. Thank you.",south bend
,homeless,"And then the last one I had, the quarantine site for the homeless and then whether any temporary housing. We've not been talking as much on the temporary housing side. I think that the most immediate pressing need was on that quarantine site.",south bend
,affordable housing,"So I'll point out which ones are all publicly funded, public works projects versus economic development projects as we go through. So first one, starting with A, [ORGANIZATION] This was a 50-unit scattered site affordable housing development that was awarded tax credits through the state of [ORGANIZATION]'s low-income housing tax credit competitive award program.",south bend
,affordable housing,"There will be future phases. The foundations you see in the northern end of this photo are relatively deep, and so that will take a second phase to remove those and then remove the larger bottling house that you see on the right-hand side of this photo. FAC0 and FAC1, this is another affordable housing project that is paired with a market rate project.",south bend
,affordable housing,"So construction is expected to begin DATE0 on the 60-unit affordable housing building, which you can see an image of here. There would be two 45-unit market rate buildings that would come at [LOCATION], hopefully breaking ground DATE2, but those are a little more in flux with the developer as far as the exact date of groundbreaking. It could be [ORGANIZATION] as well.",south bend
,affordable housing,"This is co-located with [ORGANIZATION] on the east side. If you [STREET], well, you can't [STREET] on the site right now, but if you had driven on the site to access the self-storage where there used to be a target next to the site,  FAC0 is on the northern end of the site and then the southern end of the site is where [PERSON] is. FAC0 is a 54 unit affordable housing complex.",south bend
,homelessness,"The new center will expand the safe station shelter, so more shelter spots for youth experiencing homelessness, and then allow for expansion of programming. And really, it consolidates all of [ORGANIZATION]'s different services that are located throughout the city into one center at one site. The city did provide direct funding support through ORG1 and supporting infrastructure for this project.",south bend
,affordable housing,"And in particular about the program that we have for residents of [ORGANIZATION], those who want to live in the neighborhood. And so how our program works, [ORGANIZATION] has been in existence since [ORGANIZATION]. And so we not only address the issue of affordable housing, but we also try to do is contribute to our community's economic development.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Our goal is to prepare as many people as possible to be able to be homeowners. And so we want to expand our reach. I retired from my regular day job, and so I'm really working on this affordable housing project.",south bend
,affordable housing,"With this project and the two tax credit projects that were approved recently, it's  My understanding were up to about 190 new apartment buildings with apartment units with 120 being dedicated affordable housing. So it's exciting. This has been [ORGANIZATION] for the city trying to online more housing in general, which will address the affordable housing issue.",south bend
,affordable housing,We are still in  my notes right we are now going into new business is there any new business from council sure i just have a comment about earlier actions um i'm not going to spell out what this is but i'm going to say this council is becoming complicit in the idea of changing a narrative for the city of [ORGANIZATION] um i've noticed  a few housing developments that we are patting ourselves on the back about and calling it affordable housing really isn't what occurs when we or shouldn't occur when we're trying to build a community for all.,south bend
,affordable housing,"It just appears that now that we're running at this affordable housing thing, the wins that we're trying to achieve are wins through people who are connected to the local government and the heads of the local government. I'm not going to say that we shouldn't do these things, right? But when they're being lined up the [STREET] they are, one can only question where's the stuff coming from, especially when the dates of building are well after the primary all into [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,affordable housing,"As I mentioned, one of the arms of [ORGANIZATION] is [ORGANIZATION], which is their affordable housing development arm, what we would generally think of as the mission of most ORG2. What's interesting about [ORGANIZATION] is through the community development financial institution side of their team, they're actually able to originate mortgages for the homes that [ORGANIZATION] develops, and they can share more about the other items in their portfolio. Okay.",south bend
,affordable housing,"We carry out our work across four different initiatives under the [ORGANIZATION] umbrella. So [ORGANIZATION], which is the housing development subsidiary, ORG2, which is a CDFI that does small business lending, [ORGANIZATION], which is a CDFI that does affordable housing lending,  that we often pair mortgage products originated from with the houses we developed through affordable home matters and renew land bank the initiative that originally managed the city of [ORGANIZATION]'s land bank that now provides land banking technical assistance to [ORGANIZATION] communities  So we operate across a spectrum that we call comprehensive community development. And we really look at this as a [STREET] to layer our programming and our different initiatives and also partnerships and funding.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Okay, I would just like to say and to echo many of the comments that [PERSON] has made. This is a very exciting time. We have been discussing the need for affordable housing and infill and now to be at [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], to see the number of homes affected.  that have been projected for our community, especially in those areas that needs it the most.",south bend
,affordable housing,Anyone else? I like to say I'm very proud that we have people that want to go out and make sure that affordable housing come to all the districts. So thank you very much.,south bend
,affordable housing,It is really a testament and making it affordable so that people can have affordable housing. It is very important. And this is the reason why we serve on the council.,south bend
,homeless,"I'm here [TIME] as a member of [ORGANIZATION]. We are a corporation representing over 20 [ORGANIZATION] businesses, and we're still growing. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community, as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government.",south bend
,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], and [PERSON] and PERSON3 for meeting with us over [ORGANIZATION] to learn about our plans and to protect the city from being overrun by more homeless immigrants and surrounding states and communities. We're getting valuable feedback from their reviews of our efforts. We are also planning to meet DATE1 with Councilwoman PERSON4 and PERSON5.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Things that we particularly care about are new homeowners, affordable housing. There's a strong desire for a park, like [ORGANIZATION] said. [STREET] SCAPE, [STREET] SCAPE IMPROVEMENTS TO FLOW DOWN THE CARS AND IMPROVING THE BROWN FIELD.",south bend
,homeless,"I am here [TIME] as the president of [ORGANIZATION]. We're a corporation representing over 25 [ORGANIZATION] businesses and still growing. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community, as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our government.",south bend
,affordable housing,And this is how we help to bring the affordable housing to our community. So I just wanted to point that out again. It's not that we're just handing out free money because we wouldn't be getting this money if a developer didn't come in.,south bend
,homeless,I have spent the majority of my time on the council working with the homeless in our city. And what I view this as doing is interrupting that. pathway for incarcerated individuals to end up on the streets and homeless.,south bend
,homeless,And it makes the job for the service providers and those of us that try to serve the homeless in our community a little bit easier to know that there are a number of folks that are being employed and that you obviously provide a great deal of care for these individuals. And they don't need to become part of that statistic in our community. And I want to thank you for that.,south bend
,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], will you please give 4723 a first reading? 4723, first reading on an ordinance of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], adding the status of homeless to the protected classes of persons under GPE1 Human Rights Ordinance, Chapter 2, Article 9 of GPE1 Municipal Code in establishing the definition for homeless. Thank you.",south bend
,homeless,"And what happened [ORGANIZATION] was a show of complete lack and neglect of leadership in the city. Since the amnesty closed during the pandemic, these people had nowhere to go as no places were intaking homeless folks into programs because they were quarantined, ordered by the mayor. That left them no [STREET] to go and they went to the first tent city.",south bend
,homeless,"But on this occasion, the city of [ORGANIZATION] would not allow our donated porta potties or hand sanitation stations to be on the property. So these homeless folks had no toilet to use for [ORGANIZATION].  which is a health hazard in and of itself, even if we were not in a pandemic. I heard a lot of people congratulating the police [PERSON], but the police have force, they have weapons, and they have the power of color and government.",south bend
,homeless,"The only people helping the homeless in tent city number one and tent city number two are residents, unpaid volunteers, community members, activists, and church members. We've had not one person from the city visit tent city. We've had nobody from the local health department.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,I am the community advocate at [ORGANIZATION] and work with people who are homeless or semi-homeless [ORGANIZATION] [DATE]. I want to applaud the council for inviting Mayor [PERSON] and I think the mayor gave a good summary of where the city's been over [LOCATION] with regard to homelessness. I applaud the quick and progressive stance that the mayor took in relation to the isolation center and his use of funds for that from funds that are available nationally and from the state.,south bend
,homelessness,"I also applaud the fact that he is not trying to kick this can down the [STREET]. Clearly, from the homelessness task force [ORGANIZATION], there are key recommendations that haven't been fulfilled, and rather than continuing to just  put this off, he is willing to take some emergency measures, again using funds that are going to be made available, in order to provide for housing for people, as [ORGANIZATION] said, is urgently needed for the sake of health and safety for the people involved and for our community. I'd like to address some of the comments made by council members.",south bend
,unhoused,"Member [PERSON] said that the timing of the mayor's interest in doing this is horrible, and I would simply say that it's especially horrible timing for people who are unhoused. So frankly, there is a lot of urgency around providing housing. PERSON1,  [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON] said that he's concerned about the cost to the city.",south bend
,homeless,"Again, there's $2 million in [ORGANIZATION] money and emergency solutions grant monies that the city can use for this. I applaud [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON] for her advocating for a homeless services coordinator and a better plan than simply carrying out.",south bend
,homeless,"So I work as a client success manager for a company that helps maintain homeless management information systems. I'm also on the board of [ORGANIZATION], and my ethical duty as a citizen of [ORGANIZATION] requires me to speak out about the city's response to the homeless. So we know that eviction signs were posted on the city lot on [ORGANIZATION] [TIME], giving the homeless [LOCATION] to find alternative housing.",south bend
,homeless,"During this time, the homeless shelters were closed, they remained full, the weather amnesty shelter had closed down, and the mayor had provided no alternative options. So while you and I were out celebrating [ORGANIZATION] and honoring our nation's hero, the city was making plans to confiscate all the tents and belongings of the homeless who were residing on that property. The eviction was incredibly cruel, in my opinion, heartless.",south bend
,homeless,"It was also very unusual for a town to insist that homeless people are violating the law by the mere fact of them not being able to afford housing. It's also extremely shameful and shady that the mayor decided to perform this action [TIME] ahead of the city council meeting so that nobody from the public could even voice their concerns with evicting the homeless during a pandemic. It is not the homeless' fault that our economy is so bad, and it's not their fault that the city has failed to provide enough housing first beds for the chronically homeless.",south bend
,homeless,"[PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] decided that they would not overturn a ruling in ORG1 that basically ruled it's a violation of a homeless person's basic civil rights to evict them from public property when there are not enough low-barrier shelter beds available to meet the needs of the [STREET] homeless. ORG2 ruled that this type of eviction violates the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, is considered cruel and unusual punishment. Okay.",south bend
,homeless,"Now, I'm aware that [ORGANIZATION] does not cover [ORGANIZATION], but the [ORGANIZATION] decision not to hear the case means that they see no reason that the ruling was incorrect. By using such cruel and unusual punishment against the homeless here in [PERSON], the city has opened itself up to a lawsuit that they would surely lose. The only reason that the city took advantage of the homeless and treated them so cruelly is because the city knows that the homeless have no resources to fight this illegal overreach of the city and the police.",south bend
,homeless,The mayor and the city and [ORGANIZATION] all owe the homeless a major apology. and we need to work to make this right. [ORGANIZATION] must reopen the amnesty shelter until such time that the city establishes the low barrier gateway center for the homeless as was recommended.,south bend
,homeless,"So I also want to touch bases on the homeless issue [ORGANIZATION] and what happened. Unfortunately, three people did end up getting arrested. Although most of the officers that were there handled themselves very professionally, there was still some, I would call it disrespect to some of the citizens by certain individuals and officers.",south bend
,homeless,"Both the residents and the advocates were justifiably upset with the [STREET] the eviction process occurred, concerning the fact that it was the general feeling that the mayor had endorsed the gathering at the location. Advocates and residents alike feel betrayed by the mayor. The [INSTITUTION] is bearing the brunt of both the mayor's and maybe to a lesser extent, the council's ineffective leadership in addressing the problem of there being no home for the homeless.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,And these homeless are some of the constituents that you are elected to be for. Thank you. Perhaps the arrogant will fix homelessness mantra that has become a campaign cry over [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] that ignores the complexity of the factors that lead to homelessness and envisions homelessness fixed when those with homes don't have to look at them in time to be replaced with homes.,south bend
,homelessness,"We're not going to fix it, but we sure would like to be part of a team of care that spans more than politicians, government employees, and grant-financed care organizations to include faith leaders and advocates so that the effects of homelessness on our most vulnerable population may be lessened. Thank you. Thank you, sir.",south bend
,homeless,"I'm sorry, it's one of those days, violently on the seas and the air and the foreign shores to preserve our heritage of freedom and let us reconsecrate ourselves to the task of promoting and enduring peace so that our efforts should not be wasted.  have been in vain and whereas locally get wet for a vet incorporated embodies the honor due to veterans in its mission statement we work with all you to benefit the community by helping local veterans who have fought so vigorously for our freedom and whereas since [ORGANIZATION] get wet for a vet has donated  Tens of thousands of dollars to veteran-oriented organizations such as [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] ORG6, ORG7, [ORGANIZATION], 14... That's three in ORG9 Chapter 118. And whereas it read for a vet is currently involved in the planning of the construction of tiny homes, villages for local veterans.",south bend
,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] mentioned the construction of [ORGANIZATION], which will be the state of [PERSON]'s first and the fourth in the nation –  [ORGANIZATION] house veteran village for homeless veterans. That's something that we just cannot. But our reach goes a long [STREET].",south bend
,homeless,"We help dozens of veterans DATE0 from anything from household furnishings to mortgage payments, utility payments, vehicles. The list goes on and on. Along with [ORGANIZATION], we're working with [ORGANIZATION], where we're going to be putting up a building here within hopefully [LOCATION] to where we can have a collection point for furniture and household items for homeless veterans.",south bend
,affordable housing,"DATE0, I would be out of town and Vice President [PERSON] would be in the chair, but also the dates for the [LOCATION] council meetings will be available and that the council will have opportunity to see those dates, after which they will be posted on our website.  is there any other new business councilman [PERSON] yeah i just want to invite everyone out to um another town hall meeting that we're having that i'm having and i'm hosting this won't be at FAC0 on FAC1 DATE2 from six to eight we're still talking about affordable housing we'll have a uh  A panel full of experts, actually, along with some developers as well as some contractors.",south bend
,homeless,"FAC0 and the naming of the four [ORGANIZATION] homeless [ORGANIZATION], a ORG2 minor league baseball team. Whereas and since [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] has officially recognized by the federal government as DATE2. And the [ORGANIZATION] Code [DATE] officially designates DATE2 as a legal holiday for the state of [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,"Yes, thank you. It's just a question I'm throwing out to my colleagues. I'm getting phone calls, emails about the homeless  [LOCATION] project over in [ORGANIZATION]'s district.",south bend
,homeless,"We'll go directly to the reports from the city offices. At this time, we'll have an update on [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION], who is Deputy Chief of Staff. after his presentation the council members will have opportunity to ask two questions in regards to the presentation the last time we had update from the city officers i started with the first second and third district representatives first  I would just go in the opposite at this time.",south bend
,homeless,"I'll start with the at-large council members and move all the [STREET] down to the first district representative. This is an update, and there is no public input at this time. So at this time, I'm very pleased to welcome for an update on [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], Deputy Chief of Staff.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION], Deputy Chief of Staff with offices on the 14th floor of [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0 I'm here to present before you three items. So the homelessness implementation group fund allocation of homeless services and then also the final recommendation list as it relates to the homeless implementation group.",south bend
,homelessness,"So, as we've been navigating through homelessness, I want to turn your attention to this regional comparison between… That's great. Someone was just telling me [ORGANIZATION] that it… I'm going to ask everyone to mute their mics. Mr. [PERSON], you're muted, sir.",south bend
,homelessness,"I would like to turn your eye to the regional comparison of [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION]. As you can see, this is a point in time count. And so this tool is to help understand homelessness around the state.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"We had a total of 413 homeless individuals on the point in time count. And then as you can see, [ORGANIZATION],  that number has increased to 516 and so definitely want to continue to realize that homelessness is not going away and it's actually you know where those numbers are actually rising and we want to go in the opposite direction like our fellow regions that you can see here on this list.",south bend
,homelessness,"So in [ORGANIZATION], Mayor [PERSON] created [ORGANIZATION] with an outstanding group of diverse individuals and entities looking to navigate these uncertain times that we're living in and to continue to build a city that addresses our most population. And so that took [STREET] for until DATE1. And we're looking to reconvene DATE2.",south bend
,homelessness,"We really focused on issues surrounding homelessness, how we could be more efficient and effective as far as the service providers, as far as neighborhood and community support.  as well as city and county staff being a supporting cast as well in those conversations. We probably went on for [ORGANIZATION] in those conversations and then we all decided that it would be better to create subcommittees and be a little bit more laser focused on certain topics as it related to homelessness because there's so many different levels. And so within those subcommittees.",south bend
,homeless,"We divided into three groups, health and sanitation, weather amnesty and housing, as well as a more longer term item, which is permanent supportive housing. And so the reasoning behind the creation of this group was created, you know, post, after the post encampments around the city and just the news reports about around them. We really wanted to create an environment where individuals in the community could come and speak on how we could better address our homeless individuals.",south bend
,homelessness,"And then the last group was led by [ORGANIZATION]. and they did a phenomenal job in meeting [ORGANIZATION], having we split up our entirety group into those three groups. And so had roughly around, you know, seven to 10 for each group to kind of make sure we were focused and everybody had an opportunity to speak and to relay their ideas and suggestions around homelessness.",south bend
,homelessness,"So, in the first group, health and sanitation, their recommendations are as followed to create and monitor and maintain a database of all persons experiencing homelessness in our county to quantify the need for more affordable and permanent supportive housing, and that's more tailored to making sure that kind of hits on the last point there as far as having accessible  I'm sorry, my [ORGANIZATION] went away. Someone else controlling the one second here. I'll try to bring it back up.",south bend
,homeless,"So as I was saying, as it relates to the recommendation in health and sanitation, there seems to be making sure that we have ample  that we have ample housing during the pandemic so that individuals can maintain social distancing and health protocols. And so the next recommendations, we would like to study the population of people who prey on homeless individuals and develop and implement best practices to reduce the predators impact. I think this is something that we kind of talked about at the tail end of our conversations in [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,"We realized that there, you know, that there are a lot of activities that go on around encampments and around our homeless individuals. And so if we can better understand, if we can better understand that arena, I think we would be better off in being able to protect our neighbors here in the city. We also want to continue to maintain and monitor chemical toilets, so porta-potties.",south bend
,homeless,"I think it's very important. I think we all think it's very important. And then lastly, tracking health insurance status of all homeless individuals.",south bend
,homeless,"I think this is an important one as we're in a health pandemic, in a health crisis with [PERSON]. And so if we had a better tracking system, I think it would be well suited for our homeless individuals. Next, within the weather amnesty and housing subcommittee,  The recommendation is to continue operations at [ORGANIZATION], and those sites are [PERSON] and ORG2.",south bend
,homeless,"I know that [ORGANIZATION], we had extensive conversations around rapid testing for individuals. And then also vaccine distribution. I know that that is a conversation of note now.",south bend
,homeless,And so that's something that we're gonna continue to have conversations around to make sure that our homeless individuals are in the best service of care. We also want to make available cold weather shelter locations. This is important especially during [ORGANIZATION].,south bend
,homeless,"There's been conversations around extending the current [ORGANIZATION] program, which was funded by a private donor to [STREET] homeless individuals into motels. That initiative has been going well as of late to make sure that homeless individuals have a roof over their heads.  and getting them off the streets. And so if we can continue to extend that program, I know a lot of people in the community will be excited.",south bend
,homeless,"I know conversations around a low barrier [INSTITUTION] with partners has been a topic of interest for quite some time. And so that it's still at the forefront here within the subcommittee and with the implementation group and our community as well. And then lastly, I think one of note is partnering with security companies to make sure, as we talked about homeless individuals being predators and preyed upon, being able to make sure that we protect and serve our most vulnerable population.",south bend
,homeless,"And it had a lot of conversation within the subcommittee and looking forward to having further conversation as we look to develop and potentially establish  a trust fund, whether it be within the county or the city. Also looking to establish a homeless contractor position. This would be very helpful for us to  to make sure that we're on par with our homeless services, building that trust between homeless individuals and service providers and the community, making sure that we have enough bandwidth from a city standpoint and a community standpoint, and think this would be beneficial in its entirety.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"And then [DATE] here, supporting an education and advocacy campaign. We currently,  We currently support this initiative in making sure that we have public support and community buy-in as it relates to homelessness and changing the narrative around what homelessness looks like and sharing the stories of these homeless individuals. And these are our neighbors, whether people like it or not.",south bend
,homeless,"I think it's important to change that narrative and to be able to support our homeless population. So I think the education and advocacy campaign will be a great tool to utilize here in our city. And lastly, emphasize the landlord and developer participation.",south bend
,homelessness,"And so the [PERSON], the Special Care Act distribution kind of kept us afloat during the pandemic and it allowed us to do more than we normally would and so with the additional funds. And so moving towards [ORGANIZATION], that's an acronym for [PERSON], which is designed to kind of broaden the existing emergency shelters, homelessness prevention activities, as well as rapid rehousing, and then ultimately helping individuals to be stable. here in our city.",south bend
,homeless,"And so for the [ORGANIZATION] services, we allocated just over $477,000 for that program with the motels. Next, the emergency services, we were allocated $450,000 in total with what's half of that, you know, $200,000 of that  that allocation went to ORG1 for hazard pay and operations as it related to food and [ORGANIZATION] equipment. And then the next went to the 250 remaining went to the live treatment centers for hazard pay as well, and along with their operational programming there.",south bend
,homeless,the weather amnesty. We allocated funds there as well. And so within the hope with hope they were capped at 50 individuals during weather amnesty and it's still ongoing at the moment and then [ORGANIZATION].,south bend
,homelessness,"OVERALL, WE HAVE 650,000 TOTAL THAT WE'RE ALLOCATING TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. AND THIS IS, [ORGANIZATION], THIS IS A TENTATIVE BUDGET, BUT HOPING THAT WE CAN MOVE ON A LOT OF THESE ITEMS HERE. So next steps, you know, I think as we continue to work through our efforts and this concept of a shared ownership for both the successes and failures here in our city as it relates to homelessness, we want to continue weather amnesty.",south bend
,homelessness,"We want to continue to explore extending the [ORGANIZATION] program with the county.  again, establish and hire the city contractor position for homelessness. And then also we want to continue to – we were awarded the selection into the ORG1, ORG2, [PERSON]. This was the same institute that had development for the FAC0 homes.",south bend
,homelessness,"Also, with the education campaign, we have partnered with the with [ORGANIZATION] and their marketing class, their senior marketing class. And they are going to to create. an education marketing campaign for homelessness for our city.",south bend
,homelessness,"We definitely hope to reconvene and reconvene the implementation group. I know [ORGANIZATION] wasn't enough. We know that we're gonna be within homelessness, be at this work for a long time with homelessness.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Just want to be clear that no site or location has been identified yet but definitely open to having those conversations. And then lastly collaborating with the county on affordable housing recommendations is going to be monumental in our approach. With that, that concludes my presentation, but I will add that I'm proud to be a part of this work.",south bend
,homelessness,"You know, I think we have an outstanding group of individuals here on the call [TIME]. The community that's watching and hearing, I want to thank you all. You know, understanding that, again, that we're going to be at this work for a while.  and understanding that ending homelessness isn't gonna end [TIME].",south bend
,homeless,"And so I just wanna thank you all and know that we're gonna continue to make progress and create an empathetic bridge of compassion to continue to navigate these uncertain times and to continue to fight to build a city that provides support and opportunity for all of those who call [ORGANIZATION] home. So thank you and happy to answer any questions that anyone might have. Thank you, Mr. [PERSON], and thank you for your presentation, but also every person that was a member of [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,"Please know that we are deeply appreciative of not only your commitment to serve, but also the work that you have done and you continue to do to support our homeless population. At this time, we'll go to council members. Each council member will have opportunity to ask  Two questions, I'm going to start first with the at-large council members.",south bend
,homeless,I was supportive of having such a group move forward and that that group be people who are invested already providing services for our homeless population across the city because they would know what's the best [STREET] forward. And the list that you presented certainly shows  shows that and the wonderful work that has been done so far. The one question I have is wondering about what conversations or which committee have talks about creative funding sources.,south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"And I know in the weather amnesty and housing committee, we definitely talked about different funding sources and philanthropic efforts that could be beneficial to helping our homeless population. But I will be honest and say that, you know, that we still need to continue to talk through those conversations. And homelessness is undoubtedly one of the most multifaceted and complex crisis, you know, that impacts every urban core.",south bend
,homeless,"To my knowledge, that hasn't been discussed and it's still tentative. And so I will say as it relates to the point in time count, which is done [ORGANIZATION], I think that it's, I think it's important to note over [LOCATION]  despite an increase, I do think that overall we are seeing some decreases in some areas as it relates to youth and veterans. And so I do hope that, you know, as we were anticipating or assuming an increase, hopefully that total number doesn't encompass the full population of our homeless individuals.",south bend
,homelessness,"And personally, from my description of what a low barrier shelter or intake center would look like, it would deliver housing, health,  and hope to people experiencing homelessness. And of course, having those wraparound services. So not only that those individuals who were able to be there are not only surviving, but thriving as well.",south bend
,homelessness,"I just had a couple, well, actually one question I really have. When you talked about the homelessness coordinator position, what do you think the timeline is for that? And is that just a recommendation, or do you believe that's something that moving forward is going to be needed to help manage  to help manage what the implementation group is recommending.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"Okay, thank you. Thank you. okay thank you councilwoman [PERSON] we'll now move to the fifth district councilman PERSON1 thank you president [PERSON] um thank you for your presentation PERSON3 it was very uh thorough and informative uh it appeared that a lot of focus is being placed on assisting homeless uh individuals  One is being done outside directly providing housing to identify the root cause of homelessness in our area and to hopefully help reduce it.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"Yep, so what's being done? So I think it's important to know that the city does not provide direct services, but we are working with homeless service providers who are more on the ground and dealing. And a lot of the service providers are on the implementation group speaking to  kind of the need to understand the current status of the different levels of homelessness.",south bend
,homelessness,"And so that's given us a great perspective on truly what's happening at ground level. I'm not sure if that answers your question, [PERSON]. A little bit, but the recommendations and the ideas here seem to do a lot to assist people who are currently experiencing homelessness.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"My question is more, is the city taking a look and trying to identify why people are homeless and to try to implement solutions to prevent homelessness other than actually providing housing? Yeah, so I think the creation of the implementation group was definitely speaking to prevention and intervention as well. And so those conversations have been had within our conversations in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION].",south bend
,homelessness,"I appreciated your regional chart that you provided at the beginning, and I couldn't help but notice that  Based on a quick review, it seems that we have a disproportionately high number of people experiencing homelessness in our area versus other parts of the state. Do you have an idea of why that might be? That's a great question.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Um,  I think I kind of had two takeaways from the listening to the meetings, and one of those was one that coordination is key. And even though providers kind of meet regularly, that even just having a coordinator to connect the dots between neighborhoods and services and food pantries and, you know, job training programs and  affordable housing opportunities and things like that. Somebody to just connect the dots for folks is crucial.",south bend
,affordable housing,"And so that was kind of the two takeaways. I do have a question, and I would like [ORGANIZATION] to answer this and kind of explain a little bit the housing trust concept. Really, I think building affordable housing for all levels of income folks is crucial.",south bend
,homelessness,"And that gets back to Councilman [ORGANIZATION]'s point was, okay, we've got folks that are already experiencing homelessness. How can we keep others from getting to that point? So, [PERSON], could you take [TIME] and explain the housing trust and how that would work and kind of what the benefit of that is?",south bend
,homelessness,"And then you can put that in a housing trust fund, and that would produce maybe $400,000 a year to be used for services. And then if there's additional funds, people could put them, say we decide we're going to give a little of the gaming money away,  to homelessness [ORGANIZATION]. You could put it in there",south bend
,homelessness,"Thank you, Mr. [PERSON], for that thorough synopsis of our homelessness and where we are. It's been a pleasure working on [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION] and glad that we have made a lot of strides. We definitely have a long [STREET] to go.",south bend
,homeless,"But my questions are, if there's a possibility to get best we can, the council, the breakdown of the homeless, as we know. I know I don't know if everyone is still operating in silos, but who is manding the homeless list as far as the motels for now? FAC0, [ORGANIZATION], FAC1.",south bend
,homelessness,"And that is going to be a major blow to our most vulnerable population across the state, including the homelessness. So and also mental health services have been cut. And I'm wondering if we are looking at ways and means to try to provide services for mental health and substance abuse that have been lacking.",south bend
,homeless,"So thank you, [PERSON]. I will definitely look into that list that you're referring to as far as tracking the different homeless individuals.  within different parties and organizations. And then also thank you for sharing the information as far as legislative affairs downstate as it relates to the cutting of funding for substance abuse and mental health services.",south bend
,homelessness,"I just know that a vision can be completed without funds. And the money that is going in for homelessness and the emergency funds, that's not going to support an active program that you guys are trying to deliver and also implement. I'm just telling you right now, I'm in favor of an increased funding  of funding for the programs that are desired and also needed in this community.",south bend
,homeless,"So I want to say thank you for doing a real professional job managing everybody and keeping the agenda moving. I only have a few, just a question of the chart that you showed that we had about 500 people that are homeless in the city. And of those 500, how many have been housed recently?",south bend
,homeless,"substance abuse so those are big issues of why people end up homeless so I would just like to say that it would be good to know that or to form a group that will be looking into making sure that [ORGANIZATION] is getting their fair share of of that those monies and also those opportunities so  That's all I have. But again, thank you, [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homelessness,And I really hope that these things will be implemented because I think we have the willpower to be able to end homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]. I think we can get it done. So thank you very much.,south bend
,homelessness,"Absolutely, and I can definitely, I can add that to my list of follow-ups, President [PERSON], as far as kind of, you know, the regional approach, those active conversations to join together on solutions and how, you know, how they see success and failure and how we've seen success and failure and to have a coordinated effort in our response to homelessness. Again, thank you for a wonderful presentation and we want to thank all of the members of the task force for your efforts, your expertise, your commitment to the work that is before us. And please know that we sincerely thank you as well.",south bend
,homeless,You moved so quickly after the homeless thing. I looked away for a second. I apologize.,south bend
,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Unfortunately, there was no public input. I sat through the hour-long homeless presentation.",south bend
,homeless,"And if they don't want to have a homeless center in their city, that's all fine and good. But all these things that we want to implement always come down to budgetary shortfalls and problems. So these homeless folks are  from our entire community.",south bend
,homeless,"But I think it's something that should have been done [DATE]. And hopefully somebody can reach out to [ORGANIZATION] and say, hey, look, can you implement the process and get it started? And maybe we can generate some funding to help this homeless issue.",south bend
,homelessness,"This is kind of to address the concern of [ORGANIZATION]. So basically, [PERSON], this is, you know, what we're trying to do is to build a pretty broad coalition, first with the city of [ORGANIZATION] and the county. I'm addressing [ORGANIZATION] to hopefully get them to agree conceptually to You know move forward to kind of reimagine how county government addresses issues like homelessness because we generally haven't been involved in things like that Before you know, we build bridges and roads and take care of ORG1 but this is something that I believe that we need to be involved in and  for a lot of different reasons.",south bend
,affordable housing,"These, where you see in red, [ORGANIZATION] will be building a low-income affordable housing building. It will have 60 units. dedicated to households earning 30 to 60% of the area median income.",south bend
,affordable housing,"The reconfirming resolution for the multifamily low-income housing, as you can see on your screen providing the tax abatement estimates, these are city-owned lots, but if they had been privately owned. The areas in red would be bringing in about $1100 a year and tax revenues for the city. After the completion of the project and taking into account that this will be a low income affordable housing building, the expected [ORGANIZATION] taxes will be about $40,000.",south bend
,affordable housing,"And I think it's perhaps even a little more ironic that [TIME], when we have great news about the professional sports  in convention development area but we have this project right across the [STREET] from the ballpark um you know that whole area is is um really doing well and we we believe the ballpark has had a lot to do with that there's been a lot of other things going on um and the fact that [ORGANIZATION] is involved in this affordable housing project  is very exciting for me. I'm on the board of [ORGANIZATION], and I'm very excited for the ball club and ORG2 to have some additional discussions as to how that space can be utilized by ORG2, that perhaps we can have some sort of joint effort.",south bend
,affordable housing,"We're in the very early stages of it, and, you know, there's nothing we can really say definitively at this point, but  So it's these kinds of things that when the city works together and the council and the administration and the very businesses down there, that really wonderful things happening. More affordable housing, you know, filling in empty spaces near the ballpark and helping individuals with special needs as well. So I wholeheartedly support this tax abatement.",south bend
,homeless,"Mr. [PERSON] has done a lot of great work giving back to the community, [ORGANIZATION] and with the homeless and all of these wonderful opportunities to give back to the community. So thank you for developing and building a new [ORGANIZATION] in the first district. Thank you.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"The question was homelessness. That particular spot where you're at literally is a bed for many residents that are here in [ORGANIZATION], homeless residents. Has there been any discussion with the city on how that looks further on down the line after apartments come online?",south bend
,affordable housing,"So I can't say that there's a definitive answer. plan in [STREET] for the encampments until the affordable units are online. And as we've heard [TIME], there's multiple affordable housing developments coming, but those take [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] is sitting there as well. No one has been able to solve homelessness problems.  because there's so many issues that create it. But one thing that we can be is very, very intentional about our efforts and very sensitive to what's happening as well at the same time.",south bend
,homelessness,"It doesn't solve homelessness, but it would solve it go a long [STREET] to solving the problem you're currently experiencing with tents being erected on that property. Thank you. Any other questions at this time?",south bend
,homeless,"[PERSON], will you please read Resolution 20-41, please? Yes. 20-41, a resolution of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], acknowledging and thanking Pastor [PERSON] for his kindness and advocacy for [PERSON] homeless. And I do know that we have a sponsor that sponsors ORG1 member PERSON2.",south bend
,homeless,"Okay, the resolution of [ORGANIZATION] acknowledging and thanking [ORGANIZATION] for his kindness and advocacy for [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless. Whereas the word doulos is Greek word meaning bond servant, and whereas [ORGANIZATION] has been living up to its name since [ORGANIZATION] by providing food, clothing, and short-term emergency housing for homeless veterans, families, and individuals And we're asking [ORGANIZATION] as a senior pastor at ORG2.",south bend
,homeless,"And we're asked [PERSON] has made his life's mission to minister to the needs and both physically and spiritually of the most vulnerable members of our society. And whereas [PERSON] is known throughout the community primarily for trying to meet the needs of the homeless by opening the facilities of [ORGANIZATION] to provide shelter, warmth during the cold.  or a [STREET] for rest when they are rejected by others. And whereas, [PERSON] again stepped up [ORGANIZATION] during the homeless crisis in [ORGANIZATION] area after city officials order homeless tents removed from a city on lot and no one else came to their rescue.",south bend
,homeless,"And whereas, Pastor PERSON0 and his congregation  Welcome the homeless to this chapel's property to provide a [STREET] for them to gather and find rest for a short time. I lose my [STREET] when you move it. Give me a second.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"Whereas, although these acts of compassion should serve as an example to those more fortunate, they have instead at times drawn scorn and criticism. And whereas [ORGANIZATION] understands that chronic homelessness is a serious problem with many causes and not enough solutions, it also acknowledges and thanks those like [ORGANIZATION],  who go above and beyond to ease the immediate conditions while continuing to advocate for just permanent solutions. And whereas, although Pastor [PERSON] pursues his ministry with no thought of  of earthly reward other than improving the lives of those he served, he deserves not only recognition and gratitude, but also [ORGANIZATION] continued commitment to find just solutions for the homeless.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"And now therefore, let it be resolved by [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION] as follows, section one. ORG1 acknowledges and thanks Pastor PERSON0 for the work he does to serve the homeless in times of immediate crisis. Section 2, [ORGANIZATION] commits to work with those like [PERSON] to continue to find long-term solutions to the crisis of chronic homelessness.",south bend
,homeless,"It was just seeing the best in [ORGANIZATION]. We recognize [ORGANIZATION] we were called that there was potential for harm, that police officers may have been harmed if they had acted to remove the personal property. And, of course, the homeless would have been harmed.",south bend
,homelessness,Just want to thank [PERSON] and Mrs. [PERSON] for your service and your work and stepping up and helping in the city's time of need. And there's a lot of work that we still have yet to do. And just appreciate your service and what you have done for the homelessness in our community.,south bend
,unhoused,"ONE [ORGANIZATION] WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY ORGANIZATIONS AND FAITH-BASED GROUPS AND UNNAMED [ORGANIZATION]S THROUGHOUT THE CITY OVER DATE0 WHO HAVE HELPED AND PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO THE [ORGANIZATION], INCLUDING THOSE SO VERY GENEROUS WHO WISH TO [PERSON]. There are so many we could name here, as you as you just said.",south bend
,homeless,"relief like just allowing for food, emergency food and shelter for individuals. And you know you've got a number of different issues that we're going to be dealing with.  with [ORGANIZATION]. And one of those is also providing housing assistance so that we can make sure that we don't have increase in homeless population and that we don't have folks that can't meet their rental income and get evicted from their homes.",south bend
,homeless,"Are there other sources of funding to do this instead of basically saying, hey, look, you residents who can afford to pay, we're just going to charge you more to.  to help the people who can't pay. And, you know, trust me, I've been out there with the homeless and needy people and doing what I can for anybody I can to help. And I know that help's needed, but we've got other places and other things we could look into.",south bend
,homeless,"We spent [ORGANIZATION], you know, doing the research, talking with key individuals throughout the state, but also looking at the best practices. And this is how this particular ordinance was passed. And we know that  just as we have a growing homeless population, we have the population within our community that are in need.",south bend
,homeless,"We were also awarded an additional allocation of CDBG of about $1.5 million. And you can see the various programs that went to support in [ORGANIZATION], as well as an additional allocation of [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] grant of similarly about $1.5 million. And the [ORGANIZATION] grant generally supports homeless initiatives.",south bend
,homeless,"And so that's where you see the bulk of the spending there. We also received a grant through the state, through [ORGANIZATION], for just under $600,000 to fund the homeless quarantine site. And then we also received an additional ORG1 grant, Justice [PERSON], through ORG2.",south bend
,homelessness,"We have a lot of initiatives going on for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2 for the homelessness community and [ORGANIZATION]. And we also have food distribution that will be given out [ORGANIZATION] of DATE1 for ham and turkeys and a contribution to [LOCATION]. So just want to thank all of the council members for their support and participation in their concern and care for our community.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Thank you. Thank you very much.  [DATE], a resolution of [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], calling for a recommitment to the partnership between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to work together to create and implement an affordable housing plan for low-income residents of [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you.",south bend
,affordable housing,"yes it is [ORGANIZATION] jr [ADDRESS] second district councilman uh whereas on [ORGANIZATION] the common council created the solvent housing authority  pursuant to the U.S. Housing Act of DATE1 and the Acts of [ORGANIZATION], and whereas the Mayor of [ORGANIZATION] appoints each of the members of [ORGANIZATION], and whereas [ORGANIZATION] declares it is the mission of ORG1 to provide safe and affordable housing assistance to individuals and their families in a manner  that is respectful, professional, and service-oriented. ORG2 is committed to maximizing its existing resources and working in partnership with the community to assist residents in reaching individual and family goals, including those of self-sufficiency,  through education, increasing employment and home ownership opportunities. And whereas the [ORGANIZATION] goal is to provide housing that saved desirable affordable housing with superior services.",south bend
,affordable housing,"And whereas the need for affordable housing is now greater than ever before, generally  due to COVID-19 pandemic, but also more specifically due to the need of relocation of residents at FAC0. Whereas effective as of [ORGANIZATION],  [ORGANIZATION] public housing wait list is closed for all unit size and [ORGANIZATION] will not be accepting applications to further notice. And whereas the city of [ORGANIZATION] has a history of cooperation agreements with [ORGANIZATION] for construction of low income housing units dating back to [LOCATION].",south bend

Now, therefore, let it be resolved by [LOCATION] of [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], as follows.",south bend
,affordable housing,"I would just like to say that we had great conversations with [ORGANIZATION] and. The vision and the new leadership and the direction that they're going is exciting. And as we all know that we need affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], it's very important.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Just that I would like to welcome the new leadership at [ORGANIZATION]  [ORGANIZATION] needs committed and fair housing. And we have some pretty significant issues, as [ORGANIZATION] stated, with affordable housing stock in the city. So I'm hoping that we can make some very solid headway.",south bend
,affordable housing,"We greatly appreciate the partnership that's being presented here, the opportunity to work collaboratively with the city. We come to you as the largest affordable housing provider to the city of [ORGANIZATION], with over 800 units of public affordable housing and more than 2000 housing choice vouchers. We're engaging in a plan of growth within the city and we look forward to the opportunity to bring back  quality affordable housing, ensuring, as was indicated by the speaker earlier, that housing opportunities for low income persons are fairly applied through fair housing initiatives.",south bend
,affordable housing,"I want to thank the council for inviting us to see what they want to accomplish and how we meet in the middle. I think that often housing authorities are often shunned, sometimes forgotten. And so for this council in such a pivotal time, not just a pandemic, but the ongoing plight and legacy and need for affordable housing here in [ORGANIZATION], we are excited not only to bring a refreshed vision and a strategic opportunity to develop a  affordable housing.",south bend
,affordable housing,"and I would like to say as the first district council member in this area Um, I'm excited because everyone, everyone talks about affordable housing and all of that. But the only [STREET] that we as council people can advocate for it is when developers want to partner with the city to do it.",south bend
,affordable housing,So I  I'm excited when we talk about affordable housing and it being done in the first district. And so thank you. And I'm excited about it.,south bend
,homeless,"I think it'd be great to  make available at the community neighborhood centers, at schools. It's a workbook teaching kids how to deal with their emotions. And then I'm also talking to someone at [ORGANIZATION] about something that I found out that 40 to 60 percent of people in jail or homeless were in the foster care system.",south bend
,homeless,"So by the time people are shooting at each other, the problem's already well beyond where it should be. What we need to look at is how do we bolster up those foster care kids so they don't become part of the 40 to 60 percent for homeless and imprisonment.",south bend
,affordable housing,"I'm sorry. Don't you have to be fixed with just adding a few sentences of just the general substance? During this bill was raised and the topic of affordable housing was asked and answered, and this was asked and answered, and it could be fixed with just some general substance.",south bend
,homeless,"Where in terms of your care of the homeless that use the libraries for [DATE] centers, if you will. Yes. Thank you so much.",south bend
,affordable housing,"But over [ORGANIZATION], those homes will be built. We're also continuing to be the major funder of [ORGANIZATION], and we just established a community land trust here  here in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood to again, address the affordable housing component within the neighborhood. All right.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Thank you so much. PERSON0, could you read resolution 22-17, please?  [DATE], a resolution of [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], calling for the cooperation of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and developers to create fund and implement an initiative to remove barriers to affordable housing in GPE2. Thank you.",south bend
,affordable housing,"You have [ORGANIZATION],  you have this still dealing with and have been confronted with a thousand houses [ORGANIZATION] with the lights the lots excuse me and the overgrown fields and weeds that we have to take care of because of the houses being knocked down you have the container home projects that are going to happen on [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] there has been two rounds of federal funding that has gone to administration  There has not been any affordable housing plans put together. You have a third coming in [LOCATION] around the DATE2 mark, which is going to be more millions of dollars for us to help plan and reduce or to bring up the area as it relates to housing. None of these things have been put on paper.",south bend
,homelessness,"There's the expansion of the cameras and the real-time crime center operations, including additional analysts. There's continuing investments in our homelessness strategy, animal [INSTITUTION], and then of course, we've talked about the fire negotiations. In terms of neighborhood and infrastructure, again, we prioritize the Rebuilding Our Streets initiative, make sure that we stay on top of paving our roads.",south bend
,homelessness,"And we're also going to be opening up to citizens and join too. But basically, it's got a couple purposes. One, to help the city of [ORGANIZATION], but directly it's to help the homelessness solutions.",south bend
,homelessness,and really it's trying to address a couple  safety and crime we've actually done a deep dive we've gone into um it's taken some time to put this together um but it's we've gone into the the gangs a little bit we've gone into the drugs of how they're being flowed through here we've gone into the homelessness as far as the streets  talking to them. We talked to the panhandlers.,south bend
,affordable housing,"While [ORGANIZATION]'s not part of this because they're building a single-family home, [PERSON] and the ORG2 are excited to rezone these properties to be consistent with the neighborhood plan that showed these for you, too, to allow for a mix of housing in this neighborhood, and in particular, housing that can be built as and remain as affordable housing in a neighborhood that has ever-changing demand. We're excited to see that they're going to be doing two duplexes and then the quad here on these southern portions. The one on the far right, which is actually the northernmost lot for FAC0, is actually going to be a single-family home.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Back in [ORGANIZATION], I was part of a group that began the [ORGANIZATION], and one of the things that we wanted to do was to preserve the neighborhood and preserve affordable housing in the neighborhood. And as things have morphed over [LOCATION], it's become more challenging to do that. But we have instituted what I think is a very exciting component of our plan, and that is a community land trust.",south bend
,affordable housing,And the three blots that the [ORGANIZATION] own will be community land trust homes and will be preserved for affordable housing for the foreseeable future. And so we appreciate your consideration of this so that it will –  improve the housing stock for individuals who need the housing. Thank you.,south bend
,homelessness,"Thank you so much. Awesome, awesome, thank you. So DATE0 I'm here before you to present an update on homelessness here.",south bend
,homeless,"So next slide please. So here here we have a point in time, a homeless count and C list which stands for coordinated entry and the coordinator entry is a tool that is used to assess and prioritize individuals for housing and services. It also helps communities prioritize assistance based on vulnerability.  and severity of services and needs.",south bend
,homeless,"And in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION], we saw the totals of 413 and 516 homeless individuals that were accounted for. And so as as you continue to look at the the the next few bullet points here, you'll see that in that count DATE2 we we dropped significantly. And so I will.",south bend
,unhoused,"So the last time I was before you, before the council, I gave an update kind of on the mayor's implementation group, which convened in [ORGANIZATION] until [LOCATION] in which we put together a strong, robust, powerful network of peers that worked. As you can see, we had some elected officials, we had a few council members,  here as well on those on those [TIME] calls going into identifying and implementing or identifying and implementing strategies for both short term and longer term strategies as it relates to our unhoused population and also building a city that provides support and opportunity for all who call [ORGANIZATION] home. And within this implementation group, we felt that it was best to break it into subcommittees, which you'll see here at the bottom of the slide.",south bend
,homelessness,"But the subcommittee groups were much shorter, probably [DATE] for each subcommittee. Next slide, please. So within the culmination of the subcommittees and the mayor's implementation group, we came together to address homelessness and to recognize the situation.",south bend
,homeless,"So the last subcommittee we had, [ORGANIZATION], which the members came to expand some of the city's permanent supportive housing developments. They've also recommended to develop a housing trust fund to create a homeless coordinator position and then also support an education and advocacy campaign. Next slide, please.",south bend
,homeless,"So within what I when I just mentioned that we wanted to create a homeless, you know, a homeless coordinator position, we were able to do so and we were able to do so [ORGANIZATION]. This happened. This happened.",south bend
,homeless,"These are not city employees, but they, but it was a [ORGANIZATION] contract that we that we were able to [ORGANIZATION] and here are some of the. HERE ARE SOME OF THE DELIVERABLES HERE AS FAR AS COLLABORATING WITH VARIOUS GROUPS FOR THAT EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DISPELLING SOME OF THE [ORGANIZATION] AND REIMAGINING THE NARRATIVE AS IT RELATES TO OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. IMPROVING UPON THE COORDINATED ENTRY PROCESS, WHICH THAT TOOL IS VERY COMPLICATED, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, [PERSON] HAD A GREAT RUN AT TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT AND [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,"And then as well as research for funding opportunities related to operations and a development of prospective initiatives such as a low barrier shelter and the expiration of that. And then also drafting, more importantly, drafting a [ORGANIZATION] services plan to address some of these existing and planned services that our homeless individuals are experiencing. Next slide, please.",south bend
,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] slide, please. Here we have a funding breakdown of the [ORGANIZATION] homeless implementation budget. That 650 number, we wanted to, these things are happening and are in progress and have happened.",south bend
,homeless; unhoused,"And so wanted to note whether amnesty, permanent supportive housing, leasing, as well as low barrier shelter scope,  planning and preliminary design, as well as the homeless facilitators, the transfer bus passes, which for which which we have the dates there as well, and also still in denoting the countywide coordinator match as well, that that that's still in that that pot for the implementation budget. Next slide, please. So, so now we we get to [ORGANIZATION] and and we're we still have a line item for for these series of of initiatives, if you will, and recommendations and and making making note that that that most urban cores are contending with the increasing number of unhoused individuals, but this 650,000 total within implementation has been.",south bend
,homeless,"And we're hoping to have more detailed plans come forth in [ORGANIZATION] as far as the next steps for that project. Next, we have [ORGANIZATION], which we're continuing to look at funding for that project and outline the details on that plan. And then as well as [ORGANIZATION], the county has awarded them a million dollars for their renovation of their space.",south bend
,homelessness,"And and but it's contingent on a match, and so there has been a request from the city to match that that $1,000,000 for their for their for their renovations for their space. And so we will continue to have conversations with them in order to to accommodate that that request. I just wanted to make note here at the bottom that the [ORGANIZATION] includes 5.8 million of [ORGANIZATION] supported funds for county partnerships to address homelessness and mental health, which was mentioned in ORG2.",south bend
,homelessness,"And currently we're in [ORGANIZATION], which I was just me and a few other team members were just a part of in [ORGANIZATION].  in another session and hoping to compete for funding for another project similar or a little bit more innovative than the one at [ORGANIZATION]. So we're hoping to do more of a scatter site units, as you can see here, and hoping to kind of work towards that and have more updates here in the coming, in the middle of this  We're continuing ORG2, as stated before, and then also FAC0 with the county. We want to continue that and continue conversations to move that forward, as well as finalizing the community educational campaign, which is really going to be important that we've contracted with ORG3 in that aspect to put together –  a campaign that includes websites, that includes billboards, videos, just a [STREET] to be able to show the community truly what homelessness is and how to show our help and support moving forward.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"I was pleased to see that, at least based on the [ORGANIZATION] numbers, the overall local homeless population has decreased 50% over [ORGANIZATION], [DATE], 25% over [LOCATION]. What's your level of confidence in that number that it's a true reflection of a reduction in homelessness versus...  perhaps less effective tracking? So I will say, you know, like there were a few, as noted, the state report was there were some errors.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"So as far as confidence in the numbers, we have to go by what's accounted for. And I will say that there is a population of unseen homelessness or homeless individuals who aren't accounted for. So that number could very well fluctuate, in which we saw the fluctuation over [ORGANIZATION] since [LOCATION] and up until now.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,I'll ask you the same question that I asked you [ORGANIZATION]. a lot of focus and I think wonderful work in assisting those that are homeless and a lot of attention being put into potential housing solutions either with partners or provided by the city one other than providing housing or making that connection to actual housing what efforts is the city doing to actually reduce homelessness rather than just assisting,south bend
,homeless,"So I will say that the city we do not provide direct service to the homeless, but also but will say that we will do everything that we can to continue to provide a social social net network for for vulnerable population. So as you can, as noted on on the presentation, we have a very we had we we took on those recommendations from the community. From from the from the members of the home the mayor's implementation group.",south bend
,homelessness,"And I think it encompasses the work that we've all put together to address this very complex issue. So I will say that a lot of the deliverables and actions that we have in the works address the reduction and prevention of homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] to come. Great, I look forward to that.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"Thank you, Mr. [PERSON]. As everyone knows, I spend a great deal of my time working in this wheelhouse of providing for homeless. We have now had, I think at last count, three studies done as to what are the best approaches for [ORGANIZATION] to address the homelessness.",south bend
,homeless,"And in each of those studies, we have had three studies done. And I think at last count, three studies done as to  It has identified a full-time, permanent homeless coordinator position. And when [PERSON] was hired, she was actually doing research, not coordinating services.",south bend
,homelessness,"So I'm wondering why we are hesitating to fill a full-time, permanent position, as has been the recommendation now. in three different homelessness studies done in [ORGANIZATION]. The first two done under Mayor [PERSON].",south bend
,homelessness,"I will say again that I mentioned in my presentation that homelessness will not be solved overnight, so I I'm happy to have those continue to have those conversations to push for a full time position so that so that we're all on the same page. Thank you.",south bend
,homeless,"Well, [ORGANIZATION], myself and my colleague to my left. Drafted, authored a resolution because [ORGANIZATION], which is in the second district, was taken over by folks who were homeless and just kind of like just staying over in that area. Um, we not only have that, but we also have the transient population that comes in and out from the center, from the homeless, which is the second district as well.",south bend
,homelessness,"So it just defies logical nature for something as critical as homelessness is and as sensitive as it is, because we're probably all one check away from it, that we will play.  uh with the idea or politicize the idea to where we're still trying to figure out the next step when we try to have this conversation [ORGANIZATION] we tried to have this conversation probably [LOCATION] and and probably DATE2 it just continues to go on and on um i hope it works i hope it works but i i i really find all of this to be very suspect at this point  Thank you for your comments. Thank you for your presentation.",south bend
,homelessness,"And I am honored to have been appointed to serve since [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION] under former Mayor [PERSON]. So I commend the report and continue to look forward for us to work together on the low barrier, the crisis center that I was just appointed to by [ORGANIZATION] and also  continue to do this work. So I am hopeful that we'll continue to have a path forward through this very complex issue.",south bend
,homelessness,"So  As I mentioned, so it was essentially just with the reporting, we were getting mixed results. And you think about absenteeism and you think about tardiness, there are other things that affect that. So, you know, we're talking about homelessness, you talk about food insecurity, you talk about child care.",south bend
,homeless,"Mr. [PERSON]. Oh, with the homeless program specifically? Yes.",south bend
,unhoused,"Thank you. I'm also wondering, as we move into [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION], when temperatures tend to drop below 20 degrees, do we have any plans in [STREET] for a warming center for the unhoused?  in case those temperatures become unbearable on the streets? Yeah, I mean, the city has both a warming and cooling center in [DATE] protocol when temperatures get to a certain degree, and we can add clarity to that.",south bend
,homeless,"Thank you, President [PERSON]. I just wanted to read a statement from [ORGANIZATION]. In [ORGANIZATION], the point in time count for homeless individuals is occurring [LOCATION].",south bend
,homeless,"The count includes homeless individuals, both sheltered and unsheltered. This is a [ORGANIZATION] endeavor carried out by [ORGANIZATION] in partnership with [ORGANIZATION]. The result of the point-in-time count are usually published by the ORG2 in [LOCATION] and are available for anyone who is interested.",south bend
,unhoused,"I just want to also state this number is a critical piece as we move forward in our planning for shelter and care for our unhoused in our community. So we'll have an updated count hopefully by [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you, [PERSON].",south bend
,affordable housing,"they discussed  you know, affordable housing issue of this or this was the broad discussion that was had and then that question was answered by whomever. Or, you know, citizen member [ORGANIZATION] asked a question on this and that was answered by whomever answered the question. Thank you.",south bend
,affordable housing,"and I think there needs to be a broader discussion with how we measure the public private role in these projects and I'm not ready to go forward at this point with that is there anyone else I just would want to say that  being on the end of working with the neighborhood association and neighborhoods, neighborhood associations want to improve their neighborhoods and want to take on the challenge of creating affordable housing. As we all know, it is a challenge and sometimes it does sounds good in theory, but when it comes down to trying to figure it out and get it done, it's a little bit harder, a little bit more challenging than you anticipate.",south bend
,affordable housing,But what I do like the fact is that this was an opportunity for people to see really how creating affordable housing is not as easy as what people think it is. uh given them more time to be able to get the capacity to be able to do it I sat in the meetings I met the consultants we went and looked at houses we looked at manufactured houses we looked at stick build houses we looked at all kind of different ways uh to build it and,south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"Okay. Thank you.  [ORGANIZATION], a resolution of [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], addressing the emerging homelessness crisis, strongly encouraging Mayor [PERSON] to promptly prepare and present to [ORGANIZATION] an emergency temporary aid and shelter program to respond to the emerging homeless crisis and to prepare an ordinance declaring a state of emergency relating to the current homelessness crisis.  authorizing the suspension of certain regulations to facilitate ORG1 and providing for approval of such emergency services contracts as are necessary to support this program. And what the next step would be is that you need to entertain a motion  to override the mayor's veto.",south bend
,homeless,"Yes. The only comment I have is that I am really a bit sidelined by the idea of this particular [STREET] of action. The resolution was put out there to, in fact, help the homeless and also the people in [ORGANIZATION] area, which is the second district.",south bend
,homeless,"The intent from the very beginning was to bring it not only bring attention to the matter, but find some resolve that will support the neighborhood, the residents over there and also the folks who need it most. And those are the folks that are homeless. I have no more to say.",south bend
,homeless,"Thank you. So my goal is to care for the homeless and the unsheltered and the community impacted by this horrible situation. To me, our issues that need urgent and immediate attention.",south bend
,homelessness,"Homelessness is another of these issues. I know that I have been very passionate in my approach and I will continue to be passionate about these issues. What I would like to say to my fellow [ORGANIZATION] members is that I'm open to working with anyone, whether it includes modifying this resolution or creating legislation to move these very critical issues and the solutions to them forward.",south bend
,homeless,"I believe that we must commit to immediate solutions as well as long-term planning. DATE0 that someone remains homeless, they are left victim to the elements, to criminal activity, and to extreme suffering. These are urgent issues in the short term.",south bend
,homeless,Voting no on the resolution was not a no vote for the homeless community. I had plenty to say at the committee meeting and the council meeting [ORGANIZATION] when voting on this resolution. So I'd just like to refer people to that recording and my public comments as well.,south bend
,homelessness,"I was never a sponsor. I voted in support of the resolution in terms of the need to begin to address the homelessness as well as other related issues. So at this time, there is no further comments from.",south bend
,homeless,"I'm wondering about the quarantine center. What are we planning to have in [STREET] moving forward to allow some of the homeless and those that cannot shelter or quarantine at home, where will they go? That's a good question.",south bend
,homeless,"When we got the one the first time, they were the only ones really willing to step forward. And now there's no hotel that we have found or motel that has been willing to step forward. And so the approach that the health officials have been pursuing is they  They believe in conversations with the shelters, [ORGANIZATION], that they would be able to manage and figure out quarantine for their populations.",south bend
,homelessness,This is an important part of our homelessness problem in the city. So anything we can do to support low-income housing units is a helpful piece. Thank you very much.,south bend
,homeless,"Thank you. Mr. [PERSON], you have [TIME]. Okay, anyhow, first I would like to just encourage every council member to continue the work on the homeless issue.",south bend
,homelessness,"Well, good evening, [PERSON] President and other members of FAC0. I'd like to take [TIME] also to speak on the homelessness situation that is currently taking [STREET] in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, and just very shortly also on the protests that were held on [ORGANIZATION]. First, I would like to say that I am sorry that I wasn't home when the protesters came by.",south bend
,homelessness,"We're faced with much greater stress. We're faced with people that have lost their jobs that are still unemployed, and we're faced with a situation of homelessness that to some extent we have always had. All I can say is that I just encourage all of us as a community, community partners, members of the council, the mayor's office, and myself, and the people that are so passionate and wanting to try to help these folks.",south bend
,homelessness,"And I would like to call the council and our [ORGANIZATION] community to not lose a sense of urgency about this pressing issue of homelessness and safe housing, especially with the uncertainty of the current tentative having to leave FAC0 on DATE0. And I hope that we can cultivate more creative thinking and a spirit of collaboration and increased communication to move forward. And as [ORGANIZATION] just mentioned some recent incidents in our neighborhood, I hope that  even if we cannot come to very swift action on the next steps forward with homelessness, I hope that we can have swift action to address the increasing violence and gun violence in our neighborhood.",south bend
,homeless,"As my housemate [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, [ORGANIZATION] that we know is a drug van is currently sitting in the spot on FAC0 where it always sits. We're pretty worried about the public health effects of having drugs and guns in our neighborhood. One thing that we'd like to reiterate though is that we're not interested in just kind of picking this problem down the [STREET] a little further by kicking all the homeless people out of our neighborhood.",south bend
,unhoused,"What we're looking for is a solution that really integrates people who are currently  unhoused or are participating in drug activity back into society. We're interested in whatever creative solutions that the council is able to put together in order to make some sort of dignified shelter situation possible as quickly as possible for the health of the neighborhood, but also for the health of the whole city. We are ready and willing to continue to provide support as a neighborhood association.",south bend
,homeless,"We are a corporation representing over 20 [ORGANIZATION] businesses and still growing. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community  as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government, and also fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government. All this is transparent for the genuine improvement of the City of [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,"I do see a hand, [PERSON]. Thank you, President. As a member of the joint committee on to the other two at-large council members as well as [PERSON], probably [ORGANIZATION] in regards to the next step solutions for the almost 500 homeless in our city, we're actively searching for a viable location to house these folks in need.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Thank you. The revitalization was great. You know, when neighborhoods and others work collaboratively together, you see all the results, and we know that there is such a need for affordable housing, be it duplexes or apartments within our community.",south bend
,affordable housing,"So thank you for your continued work and support of this effort. And I would just have to say that as the representative of the first district, that I am so proud that we're, that the [ORGANIZATION] is building houses and,  the policies and things that the administration has been putting forward is helping to spur more of that and um a duplex um in this area and affordable housing is so important and we need it we need as much as we possibly can so again uh thank you for your hard work thank you all right uh i will now entertain a motion regarding bill [DATE].",south bend
,affordable housing,"What we have learned since [ORGANIZATION] when I left health planning to go to medical school are the following. Health is not simply a result of medical facilities or access to medical care. Affordable housing, food deserts, and jobs and recreational facilities located near that affordable housing has a lot to do with health status.",south bend
,affordable housing,"I urge you to appropriate additional dollars of [ORGANIZATION] for federally funds to be spent addressing affordable housing in our beloved city, enticing grocery stores and produce markets to locate near that affordable housing.  and encouraging jobs and recreational facilities to be near that affordable housing. I think this has been addressed not to my satisfaction or that of many of us in the medical community. Thank you.",south bend
,affordable housing,"This would be an [ORGANIZATION] mixed-use real property abatement with a commitment of $13.9 million in investment. And the proposed project is a four story 65,000 square foot mixed use and multifamily building. It would create eight new FTEs and would include a substantial portion of the building for affordable housing.",south bend
,homeless,"We are a corporation representing over 20 [ORGANIZATION] businesses. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community.  as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government. And lastly, fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government.",south bend
,homeless,"All this is transparent for the genuine improvement of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] sent an email to each of you requesting a meeting with us individually.  to hear our initiatives to help solve many of the homeless issues within our city. We have email receipts from you showing the messages were delivered to your official city addresses.",south bend
,homeless,"Therefore, I'm asking each of you to reconsider and meet with us one-on-one to hear what [ORGANIZATION] has identified as legitimate measures to save our city from being overrun by more homeless immigrants from surrounding states and communities. Please meet your obligation to our community as our duly elected officials and meet with us, your constituents, and hear what we have to say. Thank you.",south bend
,homeless,"The second thing I have been engaged to do is to participate with  the council and with [ORGANIZATION] for, with regard to the matter of the homeless intake center on FAC0. I am a land use lawyer, a real estate lawyer, and a state certified general appraiser now for a very, very long time. And this is my area of the law and my area of practice for [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,"That includes the crime analysts, as well as the other pieces that need to make that run successfully. We continue to implement the homeless strategy, and there are new dollars to enable us to move forward on that strategy from [ORGANIZATION]. So, again, as we move forward, this is an issue that we must confront as a city, and we are continuing to do more than ever before.",south bend
,affordable housing,"And on the following slide are all three properties tied into this project, which are reflected in Bill 23-58. This bill designates the collective properties as being eligible for an [ORGANIZATION] multifamily real property tax abatement and  These properties will all be developed by [ORGANIZATION], which is owned by [ORGANIZATION]. The combined bills will help support what the developer has dubbed [ORGANIZATION], which is intended to increase the supply of affordable housing within the ORG1.",south bend
,affordable housing,"So, [ORGANIZATION] goal is to convert the two existing structures into affordable multifamily units, along with developing a new similar unit on the vacant parcel. The outcome will be the development of at least seven new affordable housing units within the ORG1. Total private investment to make the project occur will be a little over $900,000, and one part-time employee will be hired to maintain and manage the properties.",south bend
,homeless,"I'm on the board of a group called [ORGANIZATION] here, which is also on the board with [ORGANIZATION], who's the director of the community police review board. And [ORGANIZATION] I started volunteering at FAC0 to help the homeless, feeding them on DATE1 mornings. Hopefully you're thinking this is the kind of guy we're looking for.",south bend
,affordable housing,"We're not talking about anyone else. We're talking about black people. And so it's great to have an idea that, you know, we can celebrate the end of slavery, but it should be coupled with and should also be celebrated by  If we can see a brighter day within the African-American community, we're talking about affordable housing.",south bend
,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I live at [ADDRESS]. We're here [ORGANIZATION] on behalf of [ORGANIZATION], and we are requesting this alley vacation in order to build four affordable housing units on FAC0 in our neighborhood.",south bend
,affordable housing,And they have been such an agent of change for our neighborhood over on that side of town. And this project is something that is going to be very impactful for units of affordable housing. It's a big deal,south bend
,affordable housing,"At this time, we would move to resolutions. [PERSON], will you give resolution 22-17 a reading? 22-17, a resolution of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], calling for the cooperation of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and developers to create, fund, and implement an initiative to remove barriers to affordable housing in GPE2.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Maybe it's a presenter, you know, maybe it's something personal going on here, but it's  It's only to further along the discussion about affordable housing, the need for affordable housing. No one said anything when Mayor [PERSON] knocked down 700 homes, mostly in [ORGANIZATION]. No one's really said anything about what this is going to look like in [ORGANIZATION] when it's redeveloped on FAC0, if or when that does happen.",south bend
,affordable housing,"Thank you. This was brought to us [ORGANIZATION], and we all do support affordable housing in our community. And we have had presentations by the administration about their work that they're doing with [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,affordable housing,"So I think it's been explained to us more than one [STREET] here. And it was pretty clear to me when Dr. [PERSON] said that this was a very pointed toward the housing authority, and it was basically telling the developer what they could and could not do. And then to give it [ORGANIZATION] and to come back before us again, um,  I mean, we all acknowledge here, including [PERSON], that we support affordable housing.",south bend
,affordable housing,Yes. Just a brief follow up to questions that came up during the affordable housing meeting under residential neighborhoods. I've been in conversation with the county auditor's office regarding the tax sale concerns.,south bend
,affordable housing,"And so to just kind of run through those,  if if we start with strong neighborhoods and look at affordable housing on the left side are our direct quotes from from council members on what what you wanted to see in the [ORGANIZATION] budget so uh an expansion of home repair a plan for for safe and affordable housing uh incentivizing new housing construction um and and incentivizing investment in aging housing stock  The [ORGANIZATION] budget responds to that. There's a fourfold increase in resources for housing compared to [LOCATION].",south bend
,affordable housing,"So there's four times as much resources available. And we're looking to do exactly what council members suggested, looking at the issue of affordable housing from all sides, looking at access to funding for existing home repair. Also incentivizing the number of new homes by removing barriers to financing, and then providing home buying assistance directly to residents and continuing to leverage CDBG funding.",south bend
,affordable housing,"So really, really responding to this issue from a variety of angles to try and attack it. An issue as complex as affordable housing needs to be responded to at a variety of levels and council recognize that in there in your priorities, and the [ORGANIZATION] budget recognizes that as well. The neighborhood infrastructure side, [LOCATION] after [LOCATION], this is very prevalent in council priorities.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"So, uh,  the the bill [DATE] will jump start that [TIME] in [ORGANIZATION] and then [LOCATION] will be an additional nearly four million dollars we're expanding the successes of the [ORGANIZATION] to continue to to invest in FAC0 and FAC1 but also expanding that to other neighborhood corridors a direct response to [ORGANIZATION] priorities and opening up that to to FAC2 and investing in some of the neighborhood amenities  that make those business corridors great. And then exploring the startup of a land bank to really figure out how we can address not just dilapidated houses, but vacant lots that are in the community and looking to partner with a community partner on a land bank.  on the the second priority of safe community uh lots and lots of conversation around violence reduction and and uh recruiting and retention at [ORGANIZATION] um so ensuring the safety of residents by providing necessary resources reviewing the data on gvi and violent crime reduction um really looking at violence sort of from a holistic perspective and then also looking at our homeless residents and figuring out how we can really implement have  uh document and implement a a sustainable plan for addressing homelessness um and so the [LOCATION] budget continues to and expands actually investment in violence intervention programs through ORG2 both on the operational level by adding two staff members by continuing the investment in the save team and can and actually expanding the amount of resources available for violence reduction initiatives through the arp the total of all of those being about 1.8 million  um expanding investment into public safety technology to help the [ORGANIZATION] provide new and innovative ways and [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] provide new and innovative ways to keep to keep our residents safe and then on homelessness um having a really actually a historic investment in homelessness we talked about that in the context of the [ORGANIZATION] budget that it was a historic investment in homelessness we're continuing that in the [LOCATION] budget and then  adding to it with proposed partnerships with the county on homelessness and mental health initiatives to take care of everyone in the community. On the infrastructure side, as the mayor said, I don't think that there's been this much money available for infrastructure in [DATE].",south bend
,homelessness,"Our fates are intertwined for better or worse. As I've sat here this [TIME] listening, I made a list of things that came up. [ORGANIZATION], transport, bus driver shortage, after school programs, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], housing, homelessness, circuit breaker, COVID relief funds.",south bend
,homeless,"We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community, as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government. And lastly, fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government. All of this is transparent for the genuine improvement of the city of [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,"DATE0, I stood before you and noted that few of you had agreed to meet with us  to learn about our plans to protect the city from being overrun by more homeless immigrants from surrounding states and communities. At that time, only three of you had met with us individually. Since that last council meeting, [PERSON] and [PERSON] have responded with offers to meet with us and we look forward to sharing our plans with both of them directly.",south bend
,homeless,"We are a corporation of over 20 [ORGANIZATION] businesses. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community.  as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government. And lastly, fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government.",south bend
,homeless,"All of this is transparent for the genuine improvement of [ORGANIZATION].  from being overrun by more homeless immigrants from surrounding states and communities. And prior to the last meeting, only four of you had met with us individually. Since that last council meeting, [PERSON] and [PERSON] have since met with us.",south bend
,homeless,"And so that leads to about being able to house about 30 to 50 at the [ORGANIZATION] building, which is administered by [ORGANIZATION], and then 25 sheltered at ORG2. And other organizations are stepping up [ORGANIZATION] to provide additional options, given the pandemic and the protocols that are required. Then the county undertook a motels program to build off of the program established by ORG3 anonymous donors.",south bend
,homeless,"And then finally, as you know, and [ORGANIZATION]'s been a good participant and leader in our homeless implementation group, the three subgroups, as well as the full group, are working to finalize recommended steps by [ORGANIZATION], and we'll have more to report when they do so. So with that, I'll turn it over to any questions [ORGANIZATION] may have. Thank you, Mayor [PERSON].",south bend
,homeless,"I'm always on that city county meeting [ORGANIZATION] and those that are working with the homeless in that program say that this has made a significant impact very  very positive impact. So I just wanted to thank you very much for moving on that so quickly. Thank you, that's great to hear.",south bend
,homelessness,"From homelessness to the police, you know, ramping up enforcement, etc. But I want to talk about [ORGANIZATION] that members on FAC0 was awakened by loud horns and folks banging on their doors. The folks that I'm talking about are contractors.",south bend
,homeless,I just wanted to jump on and make sure that we don't take our eyes off of the issue of the homeless. I heard [ORGANIZATION] that at least one person in the 10th city possibly had been hospitalized and at least one person over there had tested positive for [PERSON]. I had asked the question sometime back when they had [LOCATION] amnesty open if they had done any mass testing of the homeless people.,south bend
,homeless,"And basically, I believe the mayor had said that he has now left the quarantine part of it in the lap of the, um, county health department. So, you know, in light of the fact that someone has tested positive in that homeless encampment, um, I think it's,  something that's necessary that maybe we look into pushing the county to visit one of the places, maybe FAC0 or FAC1 or somewhere where the homeless gather and we try to accomplish a mass testing.",south bend
,homeless,"And a lot of them don't have masks and probably don't have sanitizers. I'm not sure if the,  hand sanitizer station is out there yet. I was told they were gonna take some [PERSON] and a hand sanitizing station out there, but I just wanna let you know that there has been some positive [PERSON] cases there and we need to stay on top of the homeless issue and keep pushing to find a solution.",south bend
,homeless,"City right now and the homeless population and the decisions that will be made, we ask God that you would look on our mayor, our police chief, all of our elected officials, and allow them to represent the people. We pray God for peace in our city. We ask that you will watch over families and young people.",south bend
,homeless,"Now we'll turn to special business at this time. Mayor [PERSON] will give us an update. On city-related issues as well as anything on FAC0, I believe the main concern from this common council has been the homeless tent city.",south bend
,homeless,"But we'll know how this opening is going in relative short order. So that's where we are and we continue to work with our health officials and [ORGANIZATION] and our partners in the county to increase testing, contact tracing, and the pieces that are going to help us contain further outbreaks without having to resort to stay at home or more extreme separation or isolation measures. I know the issue of our chronic homeless population has become front and center, especially [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,"And in particular, there is an [ORGANIZATION] emergency solutions grant, which is federal funding, and it funds five shelters, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], and [LOCATION]. It doesn't fund the whole bit. They get other federal funding outside of this amount, as well as fundraising and other funding sources, but we do direct the funds that we manage as a city toward those.  those entities.",south bend
,homeless,"And we use the balance mainly for three agencies for rapid rehousing. And those are similar agencies, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2. And then [PERSON], which includes membership from [ORGANIZATION] and the county and [PERSON], administers another portion of those federal [LOCATION] funds, and some of those are directed toward GPE2 for tenant-based rental assistance to mentally ill and our homeless populations.",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"But as you know, [ORGANIZATION], I believe [PERSON], [DATE], was when we had our, at least in recent memory, our first start of a type of encampment that happened under the bridge there on FAC0. And what came out of this was the report on chronic homelessness from the working group under the previous administration. And the chronic homeless individuals account for a small fraction of the total homeless population over the course of [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,"And that was found as best practices across the country. And with the thought that  Even though we have leading institutions for what we might call the non chronically homeless, you know [ORGANIZATION] has received a lot of accolades over [ORGANIZATION] for what they're able to provide relative to what other cities do. And we have a host of other agencies as well that provide services.",south bend
,homeless,"So the. So what we're really talking about are these chronically homeless individuals for the most part. And what the Housing First principle is about is there may be a host of issues why these individuals are chronically homeless and not able to –  not able to take part in the other services, or not able to move toward a more stable life with shelter.",south bend
,homeless,"And we also did work to help a consultant process to get us to join the balance of state piece. On the permanent supportive housing side, we were able to partner –  with different with I don't know the exact entities names but the corporation for supportive housing and their applications and Get the what we know is the [ORGANIZATION] apartments over there off FAC0, and that was 32 units of  And there was a second project that's been under consideration for [ORGANIZATION] that proposed 22 new permanent supportive housing units and up to 40 scattered site permanent supportive housing units, as well as vouchers. We've also separately worked with [ORGANIZATION] over [LOCATION] to coordinate different projects.",south bend
,affordable housing,"But that piece was not, I don't know all that went into that, but I think where we can get scattered site supportive housing units, I mean, the goal is to decentralize.  a lot of this and so that there's not any one built up issue or compounding issues by having you know more density in terms of these individuals  We're also working with [ORGANIZATION], who have agreed to offer at least five permanent supportive housing units. So that's all recent work to try to get some of these long-term solutions moving and get more permanent shelter options for our unsheltered population. At the same time, the city entered into arrangements that, again, were unprecedented with the formation of the FAC0 building over there by [PERSON] as a weather amnesty site.",south bend
,homeless,"I believe we used it for [ORGANIZATION] of two winters. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], there was the option over there at FAC0 where [ORGANIZATION] operated weather amnesty  And then [ORGANIZATION], the ORG1 building over on FAC1 was a weather amnesty, along with ORG2 opens up parts of their facilities for weather amnesty as well. The other new thing [ORGANIZATION] was the partnership with ORG3 for a day center.",south bend
,homeless,"But it's not, that's not something we can do long term or if there needs to be an extension past this first period of the coronavirus crisis. The health officials are working to, you know, we know testing has been an issue across the board, but they are working to test our homeless populations. And they tested those in shelters and are working to test the unsheltered individuals.",south bend
,homelessness,"and You know at [TIME] There were still a number of folks there and both people who are experiencing homelessness as well as a number of advocates on behalf of those individuals I'm proud of the men and women in code and police and  for how they took on this difficult task [ORGANIZATION]. That was not an easy environment to go into, but for the most part, it went as smooth as we might have hoped. We, of course, would have hoped for a smoother transition, but all things considered and where it could have gone, it was relatively smooth.",south bend
,homeless,"So that's going on the short term. In terms of the long term, if this council  does support the [ORGANIZATION] approach and strategy. We'd be looking to strengthen that coordinated entry system and continue to expand the number of permanent supportive housing units for the chronic homeless individuals.",south bend
,homeless,"We'll continue to seek more regional partners because we do know that this is not –  [ORGANIZATION] hosts a lot of the services for homeless in our area, but it is a regional issue and certainly need to engage more regional partners. And the other piece is that some people have suggested, and this is up for discussion, is trying to decentralize the provision of existing services so that no one  area or a neighborhood has to bear the full brunt of our region's issues. And so that's something we heard when we were trying to site the gateway or the intake center, where the southeast neighborhood said, well, we have all these services.",south bend
,homeless,"Is there any [STREET] that you could find it somewhere else? But then the challenge is,  the people are going to gravitate toward where the services are so so unless there is a [STREET] to decentralize it somewhat we're always going to have this this challenge so whether we whether we adopt housing first or not if this if many of the services remain in the area  chronically homeless individuals are going to remain in the area whether they're sheltered or not.",south bend
,homelessness,"I think that is kind of a concern that I've had also, as you know, my voice to the media that we need to start those, that task force again, the homelessness task force that some of the council members, I know [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], were both a part of [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] before we received a new council. Um, I know talking to a lot of these council members that they're, they're looking for that, um, permanent supportive housing and we really need to work on that.",south bend
,homeless,"I think some of the biggest issues that we had in the past was, it was hurry up, make a decision and this is what we're going to do, uh, which I believe a longer in, you know, um,  Timing is horrible all the time with this issue. There's always going to be a homeless issue, but we need to work on a long-term solution and bring everybody to the table to work on that.",south bend
,homeless,It's not the best case scenario. And we're not doing a very good job of running a [INSTITUTION] as it relates to [ORGANIZATION]. So I don't understand how we transition from there as a [ORGANIZATION] into something that's going to be downtown to help support the homeless when we are doing less than a good job there on FAC0 right now.,south bend
,homelessness,"The other question I have, and it relates not only to homelessness, but definitely the overall health of the city financially. I have some really deep concerns on how we're going to move forward in [ORGANIZATION] and also [LOCATION], not only because of [ORGANIZATION], but what is happening right now. The health of our city is dependent upon the school corporation, if I remember correctly, if I know that to be true.",south bend
,homeless,"So how are we going to continue to offer the services, [INSTITUTION] included?  to all of these people who don't have anything when we don't have anything coming in and so there's a lot more to that discussion but i would just ask those two right now because uh i think we're you know in a crunch for time right now",south bend
,homeless,"But those instances have been relatively infrequent, given the number, and we've had a number of guests recover successfully in return.  back to [ORGANIZATION]. So, I mean, there's also been some positive stories about that. So, I would just contest the fact that it hasn't been run well, despite there is a concerted effort by, you know, by certain folks up in the general area of the isolation center that just don't like it, just like almost any homeless service that is provided across the community.",south bend
,homeless,"So if we're going to go back to the same type of framework, then what are we going to change up and do? And that's not necessarily hiring new people  I don't know if we want to be in the homeless, the homeless, the idea of being a homeless center, meaning [ORGANIZATION], the city of [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, no, that's a fair point.",south bend
,homeless,"We already have the homeless is our most vulnerable population. We also coupled with the disparities study, coupled with [PERSON], coupled with the minority businesses and even the entire economy. So I definitely know that this is going to take a long time.",south bend
,homeless,"Mayor [PERSON], I would like to first start off with a question. And I don't know, I could be misunderstanding this, but it seemed that in the beginning you were talking about the potential funding for a city-run [INSTITUTION] being [ORGANIZATION] dollars that we  we get and currently distribute area service providers. So are we talking about discontinuing that district in favor of taking those dollars and putting them towards the city one run shelter?",south bend
,homeless; homelessness,"I know we can't get into everything [TIME]. I also have some concerns about...  the model and, you know, if we're talking low barrier or no barrier, right, I think that, you know, to expect folks to give folks a roof over their head. over their head without expecting them to address any kind of root cause for for the homeless uh for the homelessness given that nearly 75 percent of unsheltered folks in the you know [ORGANIZATION] struggle with substance abuse i think that those are real things to address and what that looks like from a programming standpoint uh if the city were trying to take this and that's that's a big",south bend
,homelessness,"I don't believe that it is a best practice for us to  be operating a facility like that when so many needs are there right the wraparound services I've had numerous calls [ORGANIZATION] in emails from people in my district talking about the downtown area the that comes with chronic homelessness is a drug abuse some of  my residents and their families bicycling downtown, witnessing some things that he wished his children had not witnessed. So we do know that there is a bigger reach than I think the city should be getting involved with.",south bend
,homeless,"I met with you, sir, in your office in [ORGANIZATION], and I asked you if we could please talk  put that task force back together, that it was critical that we get moving on the homeless issues in the city. And that was early [ORGANIZATION]. I reached out to [ORGANIZATION] in [DATE], talking to her about my concerns about closing the weather amnesty during the [PERSON] pandemic, asking if we could find ways to please keep that open so that we did not have a situation downtown like we saw [ORGANIZATION].",south bend
,homeless,"You mentioned in your opening that you have a coordinator for homeless services. I wonder if I could get their name and their hire date to know who that person is, because I've been on all of the [ORGANIZATION] homeless community meetings. and they are not aware of this coordinator.",south bend
,homeless,"Thank you. Thank you, Vice President [PERSON]. I'd like to thank you for coming before the council and sharing information not only in regards to [PERSON] but the situation with our most vulnerable population and that's the homeless  I agree.",south bend
,homeless; affordable housing,"One thing about being the last person, a lot of things that you would state have already been stated, but I believe it's very critical that we start having conversations in regards to a housing issue. We have a lack of affordable housing, safe housing for a large percentage of our residents. That includes the homeless.",south bend
,homeless,"I understand that this is a very tough, uh,  conversation and decisions that we have to make. But we want to make sure that all of our citizens, including the homeless, that they're safe and that they have healthy shelter as we move forward as a city. Thank you.",south bend
,homeless,"I just have a really quick comment about as we're leading into a new idea or a new, I guess, homeless situation. I guess this is going to be another advocacy group built out of community members or elected officials. One thing that I want to point out [ORGANIZATION] was really difficult out there for many members of the community, at least the whole nine.",south bend
,homeless,"But that's not what I got. I got phone calls about the activity and some of the violent nature in which it was handled by our local [INSTITUTION]. I don't know how ORG0 ends up out in front of some homeless people that we know that's unarmed, that is very vulnerable and need help.",south bend
,homeless,"It's back to me, full [STREET] again. I, Mr. [PERSON], there's maybe one population that we haven't  talked about in full and that our homeless population in [ORGANIZATION] and we've certainly invested in the quarantine site and to isolate persons who are homeless if they test positive or while they're waiting for their test. Do you foresee any other um uh  additional concerns coming with that particular population and potentially other assistance that may need to provide?",south bend

So out of all of that we we  started to formulate the neighborhood plan itself.",south bend

And really important from the administration's perspective is that this establishment really mimics a leadership model that's proven effective. So almost every other city department, really every other city department has this leadership model where there's a department head and then a deputy to expand the reach of that department head and to assist in the strategic leadership of [ORGANIZATION].",south bend

One, you probably have some argument to be made and would find agreement with me and a host of others about how the federal government does not provide a lot of metrics for a lot of their dollars. But I would also say that when you look at the city of [ORGANIZATION] and what our human services department has done with homeless dollars and reducing homelessness in our community,  we are really a national story to look at much of the work that can be done.",rockford
12_06_2021,homelessness,"I think it's veterans' homelessness, and I think we've done two other categories as well and are working towards [DATE] of the five categories in homelessness for functional zero.

12_06_2021,homeless; homelessness,"But I believe the numbers were [ORGANIZATION] ago, [LOCATION], it was 230, 250 in homelessness count. Even after the, not after, through the pandemic, just as DATE2, and my memory could be off, this is from memory, it was about 150. So the efforts that our human services staff is doing is actually pretty incredible.  older woman PERSON0 Thank You mayor speaking on the homeless I had a young lady come to my house DATE3 and she what didn't have a [STREET] to stay it was right before it started to get really cold",rockford
12_06_2021,homelessness,"So over the course of the pandemic, some of those circumstances have changed. However,  Each of the funding streams that come from [ORGANIZATION] have different requirements for those programs. So, for example, the Emergency Solutions Grant will have different requirements for actually qualifying for that program and what a person actually has their situation has to be in order to be indicative of imminent homelessness.",rockford
12_06_2021,homeless,"It's not always the exact same thing for a person depending on their situation. So sometimes that will change depending on the assistance that they actually qualify for, like how they qualify for it can change. Now with regards to these funds,  These home ARP funds are different from some of the other homeless funds that [ORGANIZATION] has accepted from ORG1 and that these dollars are actually intended, although your description said to provide housing and services, these dollars really are more so with regards to housing.",rockford
12_06_2021,affordable housing,"development and support of affordable housing. So what happens is that the approval of this grant award from [ORGANIZATION] would actually allow [ORGANIZATION] to immediately start utilizing up to 5% of the total award for administrative and planning activities, but acceptance of this award is not approval for specific projects or plans. The city is then required to go through a full consultation and public participation process  that assesses unmet need with qualifying populations as well as creating an overall plan.",rockford
12_06_2021,homeless,So this is more for funding like large-scale projects that actually address some of the gaps in housing and availability for homeless folks. So this is not intended to be another rental assistance program or a program for folks that are imminently housed just paying the rent somewhere. ARP dollars are really more so about funding a large-scale project or allowing the city to come up with a comprehensive plan for how to support a large-scale project to help house homeless individuals.,rockford

08_21_2023,affordable housing,"I don't have the advantage of growing up in [ORGANIZATION], But I've seen a west side of [ORGANIZATION] that essentially became, in a sense, subsidized housing, affordable housing, dumping ground. The sites were not scattered. They were of high density, crowding people together, and complete opposite to how this should have been done.",rockford
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], other major cities, have learned this. And I don't. No, that we quite have, and we really don't have a [STREET] to look at housing and affordable housing or subsidized housing in [PERSON].",rockford
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"And it's almost like putting more affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] is like drilling holes in a hull of a sinking ship, hoping the water will run out. And I think we're struggling here across our city. And I'll outline a couple of reasons.",rockford
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"I know there's a distinction between affordable housing and subsidized housing, and people like it to make it that [STREET]. I think it's a matter of semantics. Most housing that receives either government funding with Section 8 tax credits, grants, tax rebates, whatever you may call them, essentially is subsidized housing and essentially almost a public housing project.",rockford

I also ask them, what is the city's per household or per capita income that is required to sustain a number of affordable housing units within a demographic? I asked...",rockford
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"So we never, the big question I have is we don't study the ripple effect that creating more subsidized or affordable housing units have within a demographic. There's a significant percentage of these folks, not all of them, but some of them who require the housing have other challenges that need to be met by schools, schools. [ORGANIZATION], fire calls, social service calls, non-government agency contribution, and police calls.",rockford
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"Is there another agenda? But I do support, affordable housing for people for no fault of their own who land up in dire straits for those unable to care for themselves. But however, general housing in [ORGANIZATION] has been a failure.",rockford
08_21_2023,affordable housing,How are we going to dilute them? What is our philosophy? What are we doing with public and affordable housing?,rockford
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"and I believe alderman [ORGANIZATION] had her hand up again. Yeah. Thank you your honor for allowing me to speak Just a few things on this number one is, you know I think most rock 40 ins have received their assessments and if you haven't you'll probably get the sticker shock of 11% increase in your property assessment and that is basically because we have a shortage of housing in our in our area it's created a really Undue need for housing and cause and causing prices to skyrocket in this area and so whether it's low income whether it's Affordable housing middle income, you know, I don't care if it's a mansion We should be seeing build build build here in the city of [ORGANIZATION] otherwise, we're going to continue to see our property assessments go up at rates like 11%",rockford
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"and So I'm very much in favor of this project because I hope it gets other developers noticing that [ORGANIZATION] is moving these types of things forward. The other thing that I just would like to recognize is that, you know, the low income and affordable housing units will probably continue to go up at rates. And part of that is because when you give tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and you don't allow people to make a living wage, you generally see people losing access to housing to the American dream.",rockford
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"And I think part of that goes to the idea that [ORGANIZATION], not [ORGANIZATION], but [ORGANIZATION] has used [ORGANIZATION] as its central hub for housing. And at places like [PERSON], GPE2, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and surrounding communities, do not have that access to affordable housing because ORG2 has decided to use GPE6 as its number one stomping grounds and so i would encourage residents to get involved and get and understand that fact is that we have two interests both GPE6 housing authority [ORGANIZATION] who have used the LOC0 for [ORGANIZATION] as a part of their housing strategies because Those properties are cheaper.",rockford
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"They can access them cheaper and then can provide those [ORGANIZATION] units and I think it's unfair to residents on the west side.

07_25_2023,homeless,But the Lord said that there's nothing wrong with a wise [ORGANIZATION] . So I just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] wanted to skate a couple things and ask some question s on behalf of the homeless portion of the population out here.

07_25_2023,homeless,"And then, you know, these program s that they offer you have to be homeless for [ORGANIZATION] and like this and that and the other third and you don't get in sometimes for [LOCATION]. And, you know, they're saying they're offering all of this stuff",scranton
07_25_2023,homeless,"I just was really wondering because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] it's a very big concern and to put them in places like [ORGANIZATION] which is over full to start with, you know, there is not program -- programs in there, like, once you are homeless -- and I personally know once you are homeless in the system over there, like, you go get lost in translation until [STREET] down the [STREET] they find a spot open somewhere for you. And that is also an overflow with rehabs and everything is there is a lot of overflow with all of that right now and there is a problem going on with people needing new places. So I was just wondering if there is any type of counsel I can get from you guys of anyway to go about this or if there is any other -- other ways that you guys could help?",scranton
07_25_2023,homeless,"and then they finally got me into a program that only houses about 16 resident s. And like, you know, but, you know, then the turnover rate on that is on the person when they are able to get out and everything and move on from there. But the point is, is these places, these organizations are supposed to be helping in ways and that's the reason why some homeless [ADDRESS] they are being treated .",scranton
07_25_2023,homeless,"If we have rehabilitation in this city, that would help these homeless people get clean. That's part of the solution . Two, we need more space in the shelter .",scranton

07_25_2023,affordable housing,"But there was a little bit of confusion in the beginning like Mr. [PERSON] said.

07_25_2023,affordable housing,So there are various programs . But we do need to do a better job of creating more affordable housing in the city because it is definitely a problem . PERSON0: And especially with the [STREET] that the prices have gone up.,scranton
07_25_2023,homeless,"DATE0 I saw a little light coming from up there. Mr. [PERSON], I did appreciate the fact that you pointed out that homeless people are people. And we have a lot of problems in our country .",scranton
07_25_2023,homeless,"And when I see somebody I -- that's homeless , I start thinking , gee, you know, that looks a lot like somebody whose job was just handed out [ORGANIZATION] with an excuse like you could go to school or do something -- pays the bills while you go to school. We really need to pay more attention to fellow Americans and bring them up. Dr. [PERSON] , I sympathize with you with a lot of the gut you take.",scranton
07_25_2023,homeless,"And [PERSON] and I both met with Chief PERSON1 earlier .

07_25_2023,homeless,"I, you know, do certainly agree that the police should be respectful of people when in the community and the homeless community Chief PERSON0 did assure us that they are being respectful in handling it in the best possible [STREET] that they are not targeting people but they are just working to address when crimes or complaint s are brought to them. And it -- drug prevention and trespassing , you know, people are on private property .

07_25_2023,homeless,So I do agree that we need more shelters and we need more opportunities to help get people out of being homeless and interested in seeing what [STREET] we could help as a city to do that.

12_06_2022,homeless,So I'm not sure what the gentleman said about the safety.

11_09_2023,homeless,And [ORGANIZATION] is a beautiful area where we've done service s with the homeless . We've actually taken -- many of them have been baptize d them in the river. But to put church aside we don't push God on people.,scranton
11_09_2023,homeless,"So if you're building a thousand units, a hundred of them have to be set aside for low income or you don't get to build those building s.[ADDRESS], you've got to put in teeth in there to make people actually force builder s who make the money to put some of it back in.

07_27_2021,homeless,"So this should have been put out to bid. Like I said, the money I think would be better spent, you know, instead of education awareness I'm all about that.

07_18_2023,homeless,"And you hear people talking about the homeless .

07_18_2023,homeless,"Well, does anybody look at the lease terms, not Judge [PERSON] in the magistrate [STREET], not Judge [PERSON] in [LOCATION] because they don't even know. They don't even know about the [DATE] Landlord Tenant Act. We got homeless people.",scranton

07_18_2023,homelessness,And [ORGANIZATION] does just have the code blue for those experiencing homelessness . The wild fires are relatively a new issue to address .

11_26_2024,homeless,And I am standing here [TIME] as well about the homeless population as well. I have to thank Dr. [PERSON] for the information that she did pass onto me. And I was able to look into that and do some more research on it.,scranton
11_26_2024,homeless,Someone asked me why do you do what I do. I've never been homeless . But I have been hungry.,scranton
11_26_2024,homeless,"So maybe pause I was hungry growing up that I have such a desire that these people that are homeless , you know, find someplace . When it snowed [ORGANIZATION] someone asked me, [ORGANIZATION], what happened when the people, you know, that were in the [STREET] when it snowed? I said, I don't know because I didn't see anything about a Code Blue.",scranton
11_26_2024,homeless,"But they continuously ask me about the homeless . And they're quite concerned . So, Dr. [PERSON] , when you sent me the informati on, that information has to get out to the public.",scranton

So anything that has to be said about the homeless should be said from the podium so that all of the people in [ORGANIZATION] can hear what is being done or if there's nothing being done. You know, I can't say that anybody that wants to know get in your car and go down to -- down by FAC0 down there on FAC1, is it?",scranton
11_26_2024,homeless,"And you will see. Your heart will break.

11_26_2024,homeless,But the difference in the homeless people and most of us here is that we'll enjoy our meal. We'll enjoy the turkey. We'll enjoy the stuffing .,scranton

But the homeless do not have that luxury. So, you know, I can't stop thinking about it, maybe because like I said because I did go to bed hungry when I was young.",scranton
11_26_2024,homeless,"And we just need to do something about the homeless population , not just give them a meal, but to provide a roof over their head. So the second thing I wanted to ask you about and, you know, Mr. [PERSON], maybe this is addressed to you. I do get text messages from residents up on [ORGANIZATION] about the park that's going up.",scranton
11_26_2024,homeless,We're looking at [ORGANIZATION] and we're looking at [LOCATION] . And everyone is somewhat aware in the back of their mind of the homeless and the hungry in the city. It's always been an issue here.,scranton
11_26_2024,homeless,"And some of us might be going out for dinners and sitting down, it is true that some of us are going to be unfortunate and not have that capability . I ask during the Recovery Act funds to take a look at putting more money to the homeless at the food kitchens because not only through [ORGANIZATION] but through the entire period of time afterwards there's been a great demand in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] this community . It seems that a tiki bar at FAC0 is more important than feeding the hungry.",scranton

04_09_2024,homeless,"Let's take a closer look. Before you are even homeless , some of this is outdated because it changes over [ORGANIZATION].

04_09_2024,homeless,"It's been very enlightening to, as I said [ORGANIZATION], to work at [ORGANIZATION] that we do meals down there to do the sleeping bags for the homeless .

04_09_2024,homeless,It was overgrown leaves and all types of things. So [TIME] and three people and it wasn't that hard.

04_09_2024,homeless,And across the [STREET] are a big bunch of cinderblocks out in the middle of the [STREET] for as long as the hole on the other side has been there. But you got to come up to this podium and pick your battles . You can't -- I wanted to talk about the homeless .,scranton
04_09_2024,homeless,"She displaces people that are living together like a family, the homeless . She just scattered them all throughout the region, not just in the city but throughout [ORGANIZATION], all right, with no plan in [STREET]. A good administrator would have a plan in [STREET].",scranton
04_09_2024,homeless,"And if anyone has a problem with it, tough. And the next thing I'm going to address is with regards to homeless and displaced community . First off, I want to say I absolutely sympathize with those who are homeless or displaced .",scranton
04_09_2024,homeless,"And, you know, I hate to see that happen. I hate to see that we do have many who are homeless here within the city. And I previously spoken about the issue in past [ORGANIZATION] meeting s.",scranton
04_09_2024,homeless,"But at the time when we spoke I was told that people were not being actively removed from homeless encampments or their properties were not being destroyed . But maybe some of that has changed now, which I definitely want to address . And they also expressed to me that their primary concern were if there were crimes being committed then that's when they would step in and intervene .",scranton
04_09_2024,homeless,"He also explained that the officers do try to help provide resources to those that are homeless . I'm only relaying what, you know, some of the discussion that we had in the past was. And that's, you know, what I would hope would be happening .",scranton
04_09_2024,homeless,So having a director for [ORGANIZATION] would be additional ly very helpful . And that would be another [STREET] where we could work together to find some more solutions for the homeless community . I understand wanting to see action.,scranton

01_18_2022,affordable housing,"So this is, and this is unfortunately a giant, you know,  thing that plagues are, plagues people.

So coming together, several organizations are able to kind of build a plan, rotate staffing, ensure that these individuals who in our community are most vulnerable are provided care during that time.

And so I would really like to put a friendly proposal forward that we.  uh tabled us until our [ORGANIZATION] meeting we have a conversation about how we spend the remainder of these dollars,fayetteville
01_03_2023,homeless,"and people who are employed, and people who don't want to become homeless, and don't want to go stand in line at the pantry line. And so I need you guys to think very broadly that this is people. These are jobs.",fayetteville
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"And we also, after thinking it through and speaking with some of you, we had kind of thought that we would also like to pledge, and I don't know exactly how we'd go about that, but we'd like to pledge 20% of this project to affordable housing. That's kind of something that after discussing back and forth with the partners, which I'm one of, we thought that it would help bring in for the community. After listening to you guys [TIME], we've heard multiple times people speaking of the need for affordable housing.",fayetteville
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"So with that being said, this is not exactly set in stone, but this is something that we kind of [TIME] that, you know, for the affordable housing to go in the back back there for [ADDRESS]. So the four units to the south would be the affordable housing. Is that correct?",fayetteville
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"Well, 20% of the project. So if we got more, obviously, as developers, we'd love to have more to try to make it more feasible. But as it sits right now with 10 units would be two of them affordable housing.",fayetteville

01_03_2023,affordable housing,"And 20% affordable housing is a start. However, we are talking about doing something, you know, it's very counter to what [ORGANIZATION] would do by lifting a tree preservation. You know, it's not incumbent upon, you know, the council or city staff to make sure that you as a developer, you know, prosper or make  profit, right?",fayetteville
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"And so one of the discussions that we did have was about making sure that there's a win-win situation because we want local developers to continue to look at projects like this in the future because we have a crisis on our hands for affordable housing. And 20% again is a start, but what I really want to understand with you is how open and movable are you on the possibility that more of these units would potentially be in more of a rent controlled environment, potentially tied in with one of our city programs that assist some of our very vulnerable community members.

01_03_2023,affordable housing,"So that was another goal that we had by getting more units would also add more to affordable housing for you guys on that side of things. So in another essence, a win win for everybody. But we have not talked to anybody going forward on that at all.",fayetteville
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"Okay, and I think we talked about this, but just to make sure, what definition do we have as it relates to affordable housing?

01_03_2023,affordable housing,"The best trees are along one side, but there's also some good ones at the front of the property.

01_03_2023,affordable housing,"It sounds good, but what do we give up in order to get two or three apartments that are supposed to be affordable housing?

01_03_2023,affordable housing,"Is it the responsibility of the new owner kit or? Well, we've got great difficulties with proof and so  This might, if you, if [ORGANIZATION] decided because a tree preservation area has been somewhat denuded of its trees, not taken care of, and even maybe actually had trees cut down, and then comes to [ORGANIZATION] and says, well, we don't have very good trees here, so now let me put affordable housing there. If we fall for that, then we're going to probably endanger many, many tree preservation areas all over town.  where they could be developed with new housing because then the tree preservation area for some reason that it's very difficult for us to prove no longer has a lot of good trees in it.",fayetteville
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"And so when somebody can bring up a proposal that is attractive in some ways, like promising affordable housing, which I don't know what that means, and we would have to have a very, very strict definition. We'd have to have rent control basically And the state law doesn't allow us to impose rent control in [ORGANIZATION].",fayetteville
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"I don't think we can include any conversation, quite honestly, with affordable housing, using it as a carrot to  uh take away the preservation issue because we don't know what affordable housing is we can't i mean sitting here we can't give you a definition of what affordable housing is so how can we hold a developer to create affordable housing to get his tree tree preservation through i don't think that's fair to anybody it's not fair to the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] it's not fair to developers certainly not fair to staff because who's going to monitor that so i think we've got to look at that and um  In this situation, I just don't think it's a good thing. Although I'd love to approve it because I think a property owner has the right to develop it as long as it's prudent.",fayetteville
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"Well, I don't know who determines what's a good tree and what's not a good tree. And we're not trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes and try to, you know, give you apples for oranges. We're just trying to,  develop a piece of property in an area where housing is still needed and yes if it was going to be more palatable palatable to do something from the standpoint of affordable housing and mr [ORGANIZATION] called [ORGANIZATION]  to ask them what um what affordable housing was so I think that somewhere in this town there is a definition of affordable housing it's not something that I get to to determine or you all have to determine but [ORGANIZATION] itself has one",fayetteville

And with the rate of interest of where you're having to borrow money nowadays at 7.5% to 8%, we would potentially make it up with the eight other units by renting them out at premiums to students.

04_18_2023,homelessness,"It will do nothing for the city long-term in terms of city costs. But if you put a million dollars into housing people who are in chronic poverty  situations of homelessness. You will ameliorate all kinds of costs, medical costs, police costs, city services.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,"And there are lots of ways to do that, but there's not a single entity in city government doing that. And I'd like to suggest that we seriously consider an office about affordable housing and homelessness.  that could begin to really kind of coordinate this. And if it was up to me, I would hire [ORGANIZATION], but I'm sure there are other good people that would be available too.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"And for so many reasons that I should probably just say, yeah, what they said and then go sit down, but you know me better than that. When we talk about folks who are homeless, a lot of folks think about broken people. But I want to be clear that this is, when we have folks living on our trails, in the woods, in people's yards, that's about a broken housing market.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"If we expand our capacity, we make more affordable housing. That's what we need. This is a good [STREET] to do it.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"uh i support [ORGANIZATION]'s uh proposal i'm not very good at talking to PERSON1 but uh it's okay as far as um the homeless community and whatnot as far as the new beginnings uh my friends that have been there they've i've seen their lives change right around just by being there the short time they have they went from having nothing and now they're like they're starting to become become in bloom i guess you'd say uh  As far as the trash and all that stuff that you guys have problems with, I'm in the trenches and I stay in the trenches. I don't live at [ORGANIZATION], but I'm in the program and going to be.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"I've been homeless for [ORGANIZATION] in northwest [ORGANIZATION], and I've lived here my whole life. Anyways, I'm from here. So I love the rivers and the bike trail.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I live at [ADDRESS] here in [ORGANIZATION]. Some friends and I are very concerned about.  affordable housing and homelessness.,fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"We are very disappointed with the city's decision to clean up the trash on the trails, meaning the homeless. If they don't have anywhere to live, giving them [ORGANIZATION] to move somewhere else is not going to do anything. I have been wondering about that property on [ORGANIZATION].",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"Could we do some sort of taxing on rentals that  on the ORG0 rentals that don't have anyone living there? Most of the time they rent them for three, four, [TIME] a month and make enough to make a profit on them. Can we tax those high enough to make them, one, less profitable, and two, to raise money to help address this homeless issue?",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"and I trust you read my letter, so I'll try not to repeat much of what I said. But I've been thinking about the people I know, people who have been in my life, who have been homeless at one time or another. For a long time, when my father was little, my grandparents didn't have anywhere to live.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"And my grandfather worked full-time, as many homeless people do. And they camped wherever they could, wherever someone would give them permission to camp. Not campgrounds.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] often doesn't become apparent until someone is a young adult. He has since experienced homelessness, arrests and hospital stays, but he has a safety net, a family who does the best they can to keep him housed. But many people don't have that safety net.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,Please support [ORGANIZATION] for some affordable housing. The [ORGANIZATION] funds give us a great opportunity to make some progress in this area. And then let's get to work and figure out what to do next.,fayetteville
04_18_2023,unhoused,"So I spend a lot of time in community and in conversation with my unhoused neighbors. many of them who are chronically unhoused, as [ORGANIZATION] gave us such an amazing definition of. And I'm speaking in vigorous support of spending ORG0 money this [STREET] because of a language thing.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless; unhoused,"And this is...  someone brought up the importance of being intentional with language [ORGANIZATION] and I just want to say that there's a difference in using the words homeless and unhoused because homeless is almost like a neutral thing like oh we don't know how they came to not be with a home whereas unhoused means it's a it's a conscious choice by people with resource and agency to be able to fix the problem choosing not to and  As I said, I'm in community and conversation with these people all the time, just walking down the [STREET], saying hello, asking people what they need, sometimes just sitting and listening to people. And almost every single one of these people that I know personally, I can think of like five that I see daily in my life whose lives would be transformed and turned around by a program like this.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,unhoused,Please protect the unhoused. Thank you. Thank you.,fayetteville
04_18_2023,homelessness,"The first thing that I want to say is that we all realize that homelessness is not a [ORGANIZATION] issue. [PERSON] is a regional issue. But I commend [ORGANIZATION] for all of the work  that you continue to do on behalf of those who are struggling finding housing, securing housing, and staying in housing.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homelessness,"One of those things is collaboration. The continuum of care, our job, my job is to create a community response to end homelessness. My job is to look over our four counties, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON], and bring agencies and cities and stakeholders and concerned citizens together and say, how do we end homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]?",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"My job is that one-stop shop where we get individuals, we assess them, we get their names, we get their information, we figure out what their vulnerability is. Since we started doing these assessments in [ORGANIZATION], we have done over 3,000 assessments. So over 3,000 individuals have at one point in time considered themselves literally homeless, not in emergency shelter, on the streets, somewhere.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"These are individuals that are literally homeless at the time of the assessment. When their assessment score is super high, they qualify for what we call permanent supportive housing. That is that housing that we are talking about.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"That is that housing for the chronically homeless individuals that we have in our area. Are the majority of our chronically homeless within the city of [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, absolutely.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"So they sit holding the vouchers, holding [ORGANIZATION] money, essentially, that we cannot spend and become at risk of giving back to the government because we don't have the affordable housing with low barriers. Am I saying that, you know, six apartments, 60 apartments, 600 apartments is going to fix this? No, I'm not saying that.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"But I am saying that we need to try. to at least put a dent in this brick wall that we have created, because on our by name list, we have over 320 individuals currently within [ORGANIZATION], who have identified themselves as literally homeless,  I have no [STREET] to send them. I can refer [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION].",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"and I think we need assistance with case management and all that for people at risk of losing their housing. Absolutely. Absolutely.  for these individuals who are chronically homeless, they don't even have a house.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,unhoused,I was just speaking with my therapist DATE0 about how I'm three cataclysmic life steps away from becoming unhoused or experiencing houselessness or being housing insecure. A lot of that statistically has to do with the fact that I am disabled. But I say three for this reason.,fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"and then that ended, they would be back out on the [STREET] homeless. [ORGANIZATION]'s plan deals with long-term care of these people. I think it's really important to fund.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homelessness,"And so that is really important to not think of [ORGANIZATION]'s plan as the end, but it's the beginning of finding a [STREET] for long term planning to deal with homelessness here in [ORGANIZATION]. Thanks. Thank you.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,unhoused,"I worked for a long time in clinical settings with populations of folks who were unhoused. I'm still learning the vernacular. I don't look like it, but I'm a lot older than you think.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"And what I discovered is that in all my training and all of the work that I've done, I developed this clinical language that kept the experience that homeless people actually had at a distance. I could use clinical categories to discuss things about them. I could use theological concepts like sin and fallenness and so on and so forth about them.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,And then one day I had a breakthrough. It changed my ministry and my approach to it. And that was I sat down with a homeless person,fayetteville
04_18_2023,unhoused,"This was when I was the executive director of [ORGANIZATION], and we focused on clients who could not afford psychotherapy. And we had a social worker who helped unhoused people find resources to deal with the situation they were in. But this is the first time I'd actually sat down with someone and said, what's it like to be you?",fayetteville
04_18_2023,unhoused,"And when I've gone to bigger and richer cities that have more unhoused populations and less care for them, it has disgusted me to my core. PERSON0, I believe is your name, brought up the thing that brought me here [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] repeated on it. I believe [PERSON] did as well.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"We see parking garages and hideous student housing and very little aid going to our homeless population. And to a person, everyone I've spoken to about this is disgusted and infuriated by the direction that this town is going in these aspects. We have an opportunity to do better, to be better.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"I've seen advertisements in [ORGANIZATION] calling [ORGANIZATION] the next [PERSON]. But if that means in [ORGANIZATION] I see hundreds of homeless people shivering one block over from thousands of partying bar goers, I will be disgusted to call this [STREET] home. You do not make your home beautiful by decorating it with the corpses of the less fortunate, and I do not want to live somewhere that pretties itself by pricing up the poor and throwing them in prison.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"Thinking back to what [PERSON] said earlier about how the [ORGANIZATION] funds are for those who were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and those who have been historically vulnerable. Working in the housing sector for [ORGANIZATION], I have seen that with the specific subset of chronic homeless folks. As [PERSON] described it earlier, you know, with the eviction moratorium that happened, we've seen fewer and fewer landlords that have been able to work with different housing programs and vouchers because they've had interest to recoup as well.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"If someone comes and asks for rental assistance, I can at least  share some agencies that can assist with that. I know that there are [ORGANIZATION] grants, things like emergency solution grants that can offer what we call rapid rehousing, which is to help folks for [LOCATION] before they can maintain on their own. Also homeless prevention programs, many agencies apply and receive those DATE2 and do a great job administering those.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"And of course we could always use more. But this is really a unicorn of an opportunity because it's not something that we have seen to help folks who are chronically homeless with permanent supportive housing. And while there are wonderful transitional housing programs in our community, what we find is that they do try to target the most vulnerable in our community.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"So when folks do, if they've been lucky enough to have a voucher because they were on the list before it closed, try to find affordable housing. But that doesn't. you're really for a one bedroom allowed about seven hundred dollars",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless; homelessness,"so if you look on [ORGANIZATION] right now there are two apartments in [ORGANIZATION] that are seven hundred dollars or less um and whether or not they will accept a voucher um and accept folks who might have barriers to housing like something on their criminal background um etc you're filtering even more folks how  So all that to just say that I just want to reiterate, this really is such a unique opportunity and I am pro all housing interventions. But I would just plead with the council to consider approving this proposal because I can't recall in [ORGANIZATION] something similar to this. My guess is that a lot of complaints you get from community members about folks who are homeless fall into the subset of chronic homelessness because there just aren't any housing opportunities for those folks or places for people to move on to, even when they're doing everything in their ability.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"And I wanted to just not repeat some of the many great points that people have already given, but also to just give you some of the maybe some of the county perspective as well. Because we know that folks who are chronically homeless, we've seen that the longer that folks are homeless, the more likely they are to be criminally justice involved. Okay.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless; unhoused,"So there's over 200 people in the jail sleeping on the floor. What we also know is that there are about, at any given time, there's about 100 people in the jail who are unhoused, who are homeless, who don't have a permanent residence. We also know that it costs about $30,000 per year, per individual, to house a person in the jail.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"For example, we've given $1.9 million to [ORGANIZATION], which provides short-term transitional housing for people that are getting out of jail. It fills a needed gap. We just sent $1.7 million from emergency rental funding to ORG1 to help construct affordable housing.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"Now, we know construction of affordable housing isn't necessarily the cheapest [STREET] to go about housing people, but it's going to fill a needed gap. Right. So, you know, those are some of the things I just wanted to kind of give the council, you know, some information from our end of things, you know, because not everybody watches, you know, every quorum [STREET] meeting.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,I got a question for you. I'd like you to answer. You said that you all spent $1.7 million for affordable housing.,fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"Well, we said, if I'm looking at my numbers right, in [ORGANIZATION], we sent $1.7 million to  of our ORG1 funds to [ORGANIZATION] for affordable housing construction. But we got 5.7 million in all through the ORG1. So like the first round of that, I think the first 4 million, we sent to ORG2 and [PERSON] to use for housing stability during the pandemic.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,unhoused,and I want to express that I think [PERSON] is very compassionate and that we've demonstrated that over [ORGANIZATION]. And I think that everybody in [ORGANIZATION] and the administration really wants to house the unhoused and do it with integrity and compassion and all of those things that make a person whole and human and successful. Right.,fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"I had multiple people talk about the city should have a heart. You know, I think the city of [ORGANIZATION] has the biggest heart in northwest [PERSON] because we are the only community that spends the amount of money we spend for the homeless community with the different organizations that are in our community, the church organization, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. No other community has that.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,housing crisis,"It's not well. We need housing right I mean, let's get real here I'm looking I mean, you know, I don't want to sit around talk about a crisis on housing and then not talk I mean  we can't just say we got a housing crisis and then we turn down developments i mean",fayetteville
04_18_2023,housing crisis,i mean i'm a i'm a little frustrated with some of it because we go oh we've got a housing crisis and then when we bring a development then everybody says well we don't want that development,fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"But we can build infrastructure with our own money. So in order to have ARPA money go farther in a tiny home sort of situation, then the [STREET] up to it or the sewer line or whatever like that,  is within the city council's power to use general fund money for. You can't do it for affordable housing, but you can do the infrastructure that is needed for affordable housing.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"And so I would encourage that you don't make a decision [TIME]. You've heard what the city council is saying. And I think, unless I'm gauging everything wrong, I think they're thinking more about a tiny home situation as opposed to  Going on to the economy and buying where it should be actually also reducing the amount of affordable housing Even though you'd have your people in it, but then they wouldn't be available for the market",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,The main [STREET] we produced affordable housing prior to the cuts in [ORGANIZATION] were basically through our [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 programs. And those were cut 65% in [ORGANIZATION]. And only the mayor is old enough in the room to know that.,fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"And so we have 24,000 students and 5,300 faculty and staff.  that are competing because they're not housed on campus. They're competing for half the affordable housing in three zip codes. They're no one's fault here.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless; unhoused,"I've met with more pastors than I cared to meet with, and it's not even [ORGANIZATION]. I have...  met with [ORGANIZATION] who was very gracious and drove down from [ORGANIZATION] to meet with me regarding her work with the continuum of care. And I met with the sociologist at [ORGANIZATION] who's our contract point in time person that counts homeless individuals on that famous night when we count those that are unhoused in our community.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless; unhoused,"And I would be comfortable if we were to earmark these funds for a pot to address homeless services, unho[LOCATION]ed families.  sheltering long-term individuals and then allow a consortium of people to make application against that pot of money [ORGANIZATION] being one of those and that he could j[LOCATION]t like anyone else someone else finds a viable property I don't want to turn them down So I would be interested in [LOCATION] exploring that kind of alternative. And I even think [ORGANIZATION] would be supportive of that.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,housing crisis,I'm sorry. No worries. We've said several times that we are experiencing a housing crisis.,fayetteville
04_18_2023,homeless,"I want to remind folks while we do have time, the suffering in our community continues [ORGANIZATION]. If you don't have someone close to you that's been chronically homeless, or if you don't have someone close to you that stays on that bubble constantly from serious mental illness or something that they really can't prevent themselves, [LOCATION] that we don't make a decision, they continue to stay in the spot they're in now and potentially get to a worse spot. So I really am championing us to really take action.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"There's also a lot of concerns expressed about the property's development history, not just during construction, which was mentioned, but there's also a lot of concern that during the entitlement process, especially the zoning and conditional use permit entitlement processes, it was frequently mentioned that these units were intended or would serve as attainable housing or affordable housing. And there's been a lot of frustration expressed over the units and their ultimate sales price and also the potential that they will go immediately from or perception that they'll immediately go from newly constructed housing to the short-term rental market with nothing in between. There are also concerns noted about parking.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"However, later in the same meeting, they approved a brand new house and a brand new development. Also, affordable housing. Obviously, you know, affordable housing is a big issue.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"We're very sympathetic of that. We're unaware of any affordable housing requirements for short-term rental approval. Obviously, this neighborhood is in the heart of [ORGANIZATION].",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"It is one of the most coveted places where people want a home to be close to FAC0, the university, that type of stuff. So it's going to be very, very hard to have affordable housing in such a high demand neighborhood. to me that it was ever considered affordable housing with the price points and the [STREET] the markets control these high demand neighborhoods right in the heart of the entertainment district just seems to me that's a little beyond my comprehension there but  As far as density goes, I think you guys saw the map.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"I don't really want to reiterate much, but I will say that I felt like we were...  pitched, sold on affordable housing, walkability, meeting new neighbors. And the short-term rentals don't do any of that. Really what they do is drop an upscale motel in our neighborhood without any staff to run it.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"We were told those we got those and  Those parameters in letters we saw them in meetings and it wasn't just one meeting. It was every meeting Every letter that I received from the developer Also said these things about affordable housing attainable housing we need homes that are close to the downtown so that they can walk to work and and such as that  I was sitting on my couch DATE0 morning and I heard some noise outside my window and I was like, oh, I wonder what that noise is.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"And I know that has come up an enormous amount of times in the emails, and I haven't really had a chance to address it because I've,  um i just really wanted to talk about it but i don't i don't see that that is something a good you know i wouldn't have voted for it for it to be affordable housing unless it was a cobblestone project which we have had it was a set up and this the city knew had a guarantee that it was going to be of a certain price point so  in this current market there's just no [STREET] we could ever control the cost of those homes ever um so that i wanted to address that um and um you know i don't know legally kit if you could help me can we control what people do to their homes with their homes  after they've purchased it, is that something an ordinance that could be addressed as far as the home is only, you know, is [ORGANIZATION] and it cannot be turned into a short term rental?",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"I think, and also with the affordable housing, I agree with you, nothing was presented that was enforceable. uh if you wanted to make it enforceable they would have had to give us adult insurance and saying it's going to be affordable housing we're not going to charge more than this it's workforce housing we're making sure that people work there and and instead it was puffery is probably the proper term which means it is not enforceable it is salesmanship",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,A two percent cap. We're not even halfway there. And we're concerned about affordable housing.,fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"So I'm appreciative of your admonition, Mr.  Well, I was concerned about affordable housing. Oh, yeah. I'm not— You can't consider that.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"And I don't need to prolong this and keep anyone up any longer than that. That's all I can think of to say at this point, Mr. [PERSON]. [PERSON] [PERSON].  kid if I get this right if I build a house then you're pretty much saying I can tell the council that I'm going to make it affordable housing",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"They have affordable housing, and they also say you can't do sprawl, which is where the cheapest affordable housing would be. So which one are you following? But compatibility has always been the key for any conditional use.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"So I had to zoom in. But [ORGANIZATION] and I wanted to have this discussion as this has been weighing heavily on us. I can go into details of affordable housing, but you've heard a lot of it this evening, which I don't have any idea how that plays ownership on me.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"And why have the meetings and all the discussion if what is said is,  It just has to be said, but it never has to be done. And that just doesn't make sense to me. And the affordable housing, okay, whatever, that's done.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"Somebody said that. How much do you make? I'm just, it's frustrating that it's like we are being targeted, that these were not made into affordable housing.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"It just slows people down. Now, one thing I did not take into consideration were any comments that happened in the rezoning of this property and the idea that this was going to be affordable housing because that ship has sailed. That's not something we're even considering here.",fayetteville
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"I think we need to fix. So, but the affordable housing, whatever somebody said [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION]. Unless you've got it in a bill of assurance.",fayetteville
10_01_2019,affordable housing,Thank you. I  I concur with what council member [ORGANIZATION] just said when I saw this I was pretty pleased I this is certainly a model of something that we need to promote as far as affordable housing in the city so thank you so much for being a leader in this arena thanks [PERSON] else?,fayetteville
01_02_2024,homeless,"any of you can we'll add it to here in a little bit everybody good all right well let's go to the consent agenda number one approval of the [ORGANIZATION] city council meeting minutes number two a resolution to approve an agreement between the city of [ORGANIZATION] and the city of [PERSON]  and [ORGANIZATION] for the administration of a railroad crossing elimination grant. A resolution to approve Amendment 2 to the Memorandum of Agreement with ORG1 for continuation of the litter abatement program through [LOCATION] in an amount not to exceed $100,000.  4.

01_02_2024,homeless,"But think about as well, [ORGANIZATION] we voted on [TIME] to give $119,000. And whenever I looked at the numbers in [ORGANIZATION], we had 81 folks that were in the jail that showed a homeless address. And about 23% of those.",fayetteville

01_17_2023,unhoused,"This program has not only resulted in amazing amounts of trash being picked up and removed from city parks and trails,  It has given many unhoused residents a continuing opportunity to perform important, worthwhile work by earning a fair wage.

It is my great pleasure to present our [ORGANIZATION] and Trash, [ORGANIZATION], as our worthy recipient of the [ORGANIZATION] ORG0.",fayetteville
01_17_2023,affordable housing,"We focus primarily on access to safe and affordable housing, protection of consumer rights, protection from domestic violence, and economic justice, which includes access to [ORGANIZATION].

07_07_2020,homeless,"At that time it was a set of three buildings and kind of a definitive [ORGANIZATION], PERSON1 influence. We all loved that house until it became unstable due to flooding. So what resulted was [PERSON] was homeless after [ORGANIZATION] in 10 [LOCATION].",fayetteville
07_07_2020,affordable housing,"Just to clarify on the [PERSON], which has no limit to occupancy, the bill of assurance was put in for the single-family residence, which would apply the limit to occupancy, which I hope is, you know, I've interpreted that correctly, and I think there's a little confusion there. The other thing is... I do want to build smaller homes that are affordable housing, not multi-family attached units that would change the neighborhood dramatically.",fayetteville
07_07_2020,affordable housing,So that is just not the case in this neighborhood. I don't see how it can be economically segregating to a big degree if we're doing affordable housing. I always point to the south side of town where we were spot zoning one lot after the next under the illusion that there would be affordable houses down there because of density.,fayetteville
07_07_2020,homelessness,"The history is just there. The outcomes are there for us all to see.

07_07_2020,affordable housing,And I'd like to echo Mr. [PERSON]'s comments. I think that  this neighborhood has a lot of um it's has a lot of houses that frankly are becoming uninhabitable and i think that um the [ORGANIZATION] zoning um you know allows for additional density and uh affordable housing that the city has um you know made a a goal so i think ru is appropriate for for this,fayetteville
11_19_2024,housing crisis,"But I think, you know, it's, it's weighing, you know,  that we have so many folks that are coming to our region. And so when we reduce the number of units that happen within [ORGANIZATION], they go out to other areas that [ORGANIZATION] actually helps to subsidize, out to [PERSON], out to GPE2, out to [PERSON] and [PERSON], [PERSON]. And so when I look at this, you know, one of the considerations I'm also thinking about is that We know that we have a lot of hurdles with infrastructure going forward particularly in our roadways and our water and sewer One of the ways that we're going to be able to make improvements to create safety is by having more taxpayer base to be able to fund that  And so for me, I have a concern that we reduce the units knowing we need houses We're in a housing crisis knowing that we need the taxpayer base to pay for those infrastructure improvements  And, you know, the type of zoning that we were hearing and the considerations being made, and it's true this could get zoned and go to someone else, but it sounded like there was considerations to try to take into account what's currently out there.",fayetteville
11_19_2024,homelessness; affordable housing,"The first thing I would point out, this is subjective as a [ORGANIZATION] resident, not so much in my capacity as an attorney, but this property is not  advancing the ball on the solution to the problem of homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] or the problem of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. That problem requires a deep dive that I know this council has attempted to do and is continuing to attempt to do. But on the subjective side of that, weigh what you heard [TIME].",fayetteville
11_19_2024,homeless,"There has been some improvements made, but when it's that bad on the outside, I would suggest you consider how bad it is on the inside. I do not have an agenda against [ORGANIZATION], but as the founder of an organization that deals with veterans who are forced to live in rat-infested, bug-infested apartments here in [ORGANIZATION],  This is just another example of substandard landlords who say they're helping the homeless or veterans and they're allowed to go ahead no matter how bad it is. And there's some really bad ones out there if you ever want to know.",fayetteville
11_19_2024,homeless; affordable housing,"Also, after that, [ORGANIZATION] took that person in his car and drove her to [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION] so that she didn't get an [ORGANIZATION], I guess you would say. Personally, I am interested in this question of the extent to which what's going on at the ORG1 property is an overflow problem.

And we found this very distressing, and eventually, when public perception seemed to be difficult for them, they changed the label on that, but it's still that targeted for perception told us something important.

11_19_2024,homelessness,"Homelessness is sometimes just something that happens because of the mental illness and the addiction.

It's a process.",fayetteville
11_19_2024,homeless,And they asked us if we could actually hold a couple of beds or make spaces for [ORGANIZATION]  response and we agreed and that starts [ORGANIZATION] because we believe that the city of [ORGANIZATION] has done a lot to help the homeless and If you ask anybody we believe that you're the number one partner with us We couldn't do what we do without you and we're very very appreciative of that,fayetteville

We didn't want to exit him back into homelessness.",fayetteville
11_19_2024,homelessness,"Okay, what questions do we have? One of the areas we talked about was like regional collaboration. Is [ORGANIZATION] in the northwest [ORGANIZATION] continuum of care working on a regional response to homelessness?",fayetteville
11_19_2024,homeless,"We see every [ORGANIZATION] person that stayed in shelter, and we see every person that stays at FAC0 all day long. That's 125 people a day. So we do intakes for them that go into [ORGANIZATION].",fayetteville
11_19_2024,homeless,"So we're the only organization doing intakes for people who are homeless and working with them for diversion, right, just because of the [STREET] the other programs are set up. So we participate. I don't believe that a regional response is to send people to [ORGANIZATION].",fayetteville
11_19_2024,homeless,I just want to clarify. We are not required to be a member because we don't receive funding from them. But we provide all of the information into [ORGANIZATION] that they require.,fayetteville
11_19_2024,homeless; unhoused,"We're the agency that's housing the majority of the intakes for people who are homeless. And so until change happens and conversations are had, that's where we feel safe being. And then the other question that I had that came from the community is that it's been reported that there are somewhere close to potentially 400 chronically unhoused individuals that might potentially be trespassed from [ORGANIZATION].",fayetteville
11_19_2024,unhoused,Who would like to address us on this topic that's in the chamber? PERSON0 I would just like to recommend that you pass this I did an internship for a master's degree at [ORGANIZATION] they're great stewards of money they just really are prudent with it I think that they are gonna do great things they're going to make sure that as we grow that they help assist the unhoused population and this is just another no-brainer,fayetteville
11_19_2024,unhoused,i think it ends up being around 25 households give or take it goes back to the structure that [ORGANIZATION] gave us previously where [ORGANIZATION]'s group is given the funds and folks apply and are given [ORGANIZATION] my concern is just this there are individuals uh as much energy and effort [ORGANIZATION] does and i'm very appreciative in all of our organizations working to house individuals  We have more unhoused folks than shelter spaces available.,fayetteville
11_19_2024,unhoused,"We have more folks that are on the bubble of losing housing and yet there are less resources available while we go into colder weather [ORGANIZATION]. And so when this was, I was approached about this, it made sense to think about, well, we potentially could at least keep 25 housed because it's much more costly and difficult when somebody becomes unhoused to rehouse them. so that was why I wanted to bring that forward for consideration that we potentially keep some of these families, 25 households from burdening [ORGANIZATION] and other of our agencies out there who are going to end up having to send them into like 211 where, you know, it'll be hit and miss.",fayetteville
11_19_2024,homelessness,"I think that it helps people that are already housed, prevents them from going into homelessness and that's something that really appeals to me. To me, I'm trying to weigh out where I think it will do the most good.

And whereas if FAC1 could no longer operate as a [TIME] facility, the large number of homeless residents who depend upon this facility for showers and washing, hot food and a warm [STREET] to stay during DATE2, as well as access to a telephone and other job assistance services, could not find such comparable services elsewhere.",fayetteville

The other really main feature of this advisory committee that may be different from the others is the intentional inclusion of students  I do want to thank the board members who may benefit from these services. I did receive some questions from members of the public about why we didn't specifically include people experiencing homelessness.,fayetteville
12_01_2020,homelessness,One of the reasons that is not a reserved spot in membership is the goal of eliminating homelessness so that there would be no one eligible in our community to serve that role. people who are the sort of the next in line closest to that experience.

12_01_2020,homelessness,"I quite possibly am going to burst with pride that there is a city, a [ORGANIZATION] resolution that includes the [ORGANIZATION] continuum of care goal to end homelessness.

12_01_2020,homelessness,"Speaking of recovering from the pandemic, also want to commend the city of [ORGANIZATION] on the rental assistance program. [ORGANIZATION], we are not designed for emergency rental assistance, and city of [ORGANIZATION] was able to very quickly mobilize that funding and to be able to respond to a number of people's needs with emergency rental assistance that prevented a lot of people from losing their housing.

12_01_2020,affordable housing,"So thank you. Since I also won't be here in [ORGANIZATION], I think what [ORGANIZATION] just said is  Really, honestly, the comments we heard [TIME] made that case that if we're going to serve our purpose in preserving the public interest and pursuing our affordable housing goals, that incentivizing taking more of them off the market is counterproductive to that.

03_16_2021,affordable housing,I think that the people of [ORGANIZATION] need to be listened to and the priority of our neighborhoods. I believe that...  It is possible to preserve all of our natural areas in [ORGANIZATION] and to respect what each neighborhood wants for themselves. And also to be able to build needed affordable housing.,fayetteville
08_16_2022,homeless,Because there were a number of people who lost their housing after that and are now homeless. Certainly we do understand that. I might kick that question back to potentially [ORGANIZATION] who helps with that effort in finding locations for those residents to live or [PERSON] if one of y'all wanted to handle that piece.,fayetteville
08_16_2022,affordable housing,"One of the concerns with being able to provide affordable or sustainable or attainable housing is that the cost of land. And I would like to mention to the body that  perhaps because once you've purchased it and it becomes property of the city, if you decide to resell it, I believe that the rule applies that it has to be sold at fair market value and perhaps in consideration of the ability to maybe purchase  develop it for housing in the future, that a consideration could be made to resell it at a reasonable rate to nonprofit or other minded individuals who would have modestly affordable housing or modest income housing.

08_16_2022,homelessness,"Specifically DATE0, especially in FAC0, we had a lot of complaints in the [ORGANIZATION] area.

11_01_2022,affordable housing,"The second thing is that parking is an issue only because... We have fears about impacts on other businesses, and no one is sharing the fear that I have. Once we throw out attainable, affordable housing in this community,  Essentially, the primary [STREET] that that's ever going to happen is to write down the value of city-owned land and rent it, lease it to someone below market, and to turn a surface parking lot that the city owns into an affordable housing project.",fayetteville
11_01_2022,affordable housing,"and we need to be looking long-term at that because that impacts the parking.

If you look at what childhood trauma does to the brain development and your ability to make good decisions,  and you look at the number of people that are experiencing homelessness that experience childhood trauma, I think it's unfair to just automatically take our own white middle-class values and project them on someone when we don't know the trauma that they have endured. As I have become aware of people experiencing homelessness and the causes and the reasons for that,  I would encourage other people that are maybe not aware of their own biases, perhaps maybe this ordinance can not only give the prosecutor the discretion that he needs and the encouragement to  do what he's probably already been doing, which is use his discretion, but also to raise his awareness.",fayetteville

And so with this which is a totally appropriate action and  comes an increased need to look at other proposals that come forward with an eye to remembering the responsibility that you create with this decision to maintain affordable housing, encourage additional stock everywhere you can right now.",fayetteville
02_21_2023,housing crisis,"So I'll just move right into it and kind of frame the climate. We said it on [ORGANIZATION], we're in a housing crisis that was further pressured because of the pandemic in [LOCATION] when [ORGANIZATION] released data on the calls for the need of service  By far, the biggest need is in housing. And this continued lack of increased housing stock for needed populations has been expressed in our master plan and in regional publications around the area.",fayetteville
02_21_2023,affordable housing,"I've done direct pandemic relief work. And then in campaigning, you get the privilege for [ORGANIZATION] to really be immersed with your community and really find,  I think oftentimes communities are not quite understanding of the dire need for housing for certain parts of our population. And so having a communications plan to really identify where there's that loss of existing affordable housing and the struggling cost of just being able to make ends meet for parts of our community can really be addressed if we can get attainable housing in [STREET] for parts of our community.",fayetteville
02_21_2023,affordable housing,"And then moving on to identify opportunities for the creation of affordable housing on publicly owned land. You know, we have a lot of moving parts of the city and with the [INSTITUTION] vacating their building, leaving lots around the city. There's an opportunity in those areas to discuss and focus on those areas.",fayetteville
02_21_2023,affordable housing,"And then the long-term one that I really landed on in the master plan was creating a complete neighborhood or [STREET] corridor plan [ORGANIZATION]. And this is already underway, and many of these goals are in process or being discussed. But knowing that hand-in-hand, finding the neighborhood fits for affordable housing projects being so important and vital in the core parts of our community.",fayetteville

02_21_2023,housing crisis,it's a lot of work and as council member [PERSON] as she stated and i think we all know this housing is a problem and we are experiencing a housing crisis,fayetteville
02_21_2023,homelessness; housing crisis,"and i i believe that in order to address any crisis we have to be proactive and it's not just a favorable problem but we're here in [ORGANIZATION] and so that's why  that's why we're concerned. I am committing myself as well, because I'm hearing the concerns about the housing crisis and the homelessness and individuals have come to me and they told me that,  Their rent started out maybe at $800 a month, and now it's $1,500 a month.",fayetteville
02_21_2023,housing crisis,but we definitely have a housing crisis there's no doubt about that and and as everybody has said it's not just locally it's nationally,fayetteville
02_21_2023,homelessness,"We've had the conversation about homelessness, but then there are individuals in [ORGANIZATION] who are working the working poor. And that's right. I just believe that what I'm hoping is.  that we can start working towards something to address that, because I'm hearing it all the time.",fayetteville
02_21_2023,homelessness,"And so we talk a lot about homelessness, but we're talking,  I don't think we've had the conversation around helping those who are working. Yes, I'd like to really thank you for doing this, [ORGANIZATION].

02_21_2023,affordable housing,"And as as we've talked. I want to first acknowledge that that staff, you know, I completely respect your opinions. My concern, though, is as we work with the challenges of affordable housing and housing in general and infill, we're going to get in situations where we have to get creative.",fayetteville
02_21_2023,affordable housing,"Who's there? When we talk about, when you talk about accessible housing, are you talking about affordable housing? Because there is no [STREET] that this area is affordable now for most people.",fayetteville
06_16_2020,affordable housing,"You know the intent is to have single family homes right there,  that are small enough to be affordable. This is in walking distance to the university, the bike trails, FAC0 grocery store. And so I think it fits in with the city's goal to reduce urban sprawl and create affordable housing.",fayetteville
06_16_2020,affordable housing,"There is an opportunity there, but we know that there was an error made on this [STREET] as council member [ORGANIZATION] said, that started a domino effect and is used as an anchor to make an excuse for rezoning. I'm sorry to say it and I've said it before, but when we do these zonings and infills and we talk about affordable housing, it just hasn't happened. And I know it's because it's a supply and demand thing, but what is in this neighborhood already is affordable housing.",fayetteville
03_19_2019,affordable housing,"That started in [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION], which was an affordable housing loan purchase mandate. that 30% or more of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]'s loan purchases, that's [ORGANIZATION] Mae and [ORGANIZATION] Mac, had to be related to affordable housing.

03_19_2019,affordable housing,"In a relative term, we are calling affordable housing in the area. If you go to [ORGANIZATION] right now and you pull up [ORGANIZATION] or any other realtor website, you're going to find that houses in that area on...

04_06_2021,housing crisis,"Good [TIME], [ORGANIZATION] Members. I, too, am here to speak in favor of this [TIME]. And I could talk about housing crisis or that, you know, this is such a great area to live.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"It is very difficult to build affordable housing. Typically most cities experience affordable housing through what's called a process of filtration where housing starts as new, has all the amenities you'd expect for housing at that time and as markets change and amenities change the older housing tends to become more and more affordable as it moves through. As a result, it is certainly a concern if this property were to be developed and this housing were to be demolished or removed.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"I currently live in [ORGANIZATION] and I know that finding housing is incredibly difficult. The affordable housing that the displaced people who are asking for help currently, the housing they currently live in, is incredibly difficult to replace and these people may very well be just chased out of the city.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"We, the city has declared a housing crisis and it's important to build more housing. There's too many reasons that go against rezoning this specific property. We definitely need housing, full stop, but we have to balance housing sustainability with the humanity and quality of life of those that are currently living here.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"so yes i worry about what will happen to these students and my other neighbors when they're forced to move out because this is one of the few remaining areas with affordable housing where middle class residents can live and enjoy the amenities of our city i'm i worry that it would be detrimental to the character of our city and to the neighborhood surrounding downtown to remove all affordable housing in downtown that has character and  and diversity and replace it with a large modern luxury apartment complex that I'm sorry you guys, I apologize, no offense, it looks like [ORGANIZATION]. It doesn't look like [PERSON].",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. but if not letting this residential area be is a good thing the long-term residents of this area and similar spaces are still in need of safe affordable and consistent housing where will they go will they have to leave our city i know that this kind of question will be put to the housing crisis task force but the people who live in this housing now are being affected immediately i believe that this type of mixed-use zoning is a good thing,fayetteville
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"And that's not a gap you can just make up. We know and mostly accept that new construction is going to be more expensive than the old, and that is the reason why it's essential that we pair our efforts for new housing with efforts to preserve our existing affordable housing. This isn't doing that.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"DATE0, this council voted unanimously to declare a housing crisis, and we are all thankful for that. And since then, it has moved with great speed to approve new developments that will bring hundreds of new beds to our city. That should be applauded.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"Okay, so If if the property sells just the [STREET] it is without any rezoning someone could come in and add more units to the property That's possible. Yes Okay, so  this is a hard one is one of the commoners pointed out this is a difficult one um you know we just declared a housing crisis but at the same time that doesn't mean that uh we can just rubber stamp everything that comes comes past us and and i think height and context are important uh the zoning for cardinal and atmosphere that's that's at rmf [DATE] is it not [ORGANIZATION]  It's a mixture.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"Are we going to consider, and we do have a housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION]. We've all identified that. Are we going to up zone this to allow for the most we could get out of that piece of property?",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,I believe the the property that the the public speaker was talking about is the not that but the great building on the corner of FAC0 and FAC1  first i want to say thank you to the residents and that came out and spoke [TIME] um you know i commiserate with my colleagues you know this is not an easy decision by any means um one of the things that was brought up um you know we are in a housing crisis and having us solve this you know holistically across the entire city but also one of the things that we put in our comprehensive plan is making sure to really honor the significance of each of our kind of neighborhood centers And so I would ask for you to really think about that context around that hill.,fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"We did say there's a housing crisis. Well, I was . I know you're going to remind us of that.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"okay thank you you always know until the mayor's so PERSON0 I thought you had your life actually what councilmember PERSON1 was asking on the process was why you know I have hesitation around the sprawl aspect but if we have an [STREET] you know I guess one of my questions was whether or not when we're working through those contracts sometimes you know these types of things have been like what think about our workshop around our housing crisis resolution you know we added a lot of input kind of had a workshop and wonder if that water sewer committee it would make sense for us to be able to give feedback about what we might want included so that those that sit on that committee potentially could help with that but  Just throwing that out there, not sure procedurally if that makes sense, but having that ability to look at the contract later is important.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"The biggest point that's been brought up that's the hardest hurdle for me to get over is the vagueness of what everyone is wanting to see built there. And respect to everybody's time, I kind of want to know, I mean are we talking enough density to make this affordable housing or are we talking a low density where I have to go to a higher end tenant?  With increasing the water, I think the sewer line is going to be fine. The water line, increasing that is where a huge amount of cost is going to be.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"We'll continue on then. The resolution to appropriate a million dollars in general fund revenue received as [ORGANIZATION] revenue loss to fund the housing crisis task force early recommendations in response to the declared housing crisis. PERSON0, this one is yours.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"And it's for the purposes to set it aside to implement the early recommendations from [ORGANIZATION]. And so, you know, one of the reasons why we do this, you know, before the task force is formed is because, you know, we want to ensure that there are enough resources that are available to really support their efforts. And really wanting to make sure that we avoid any delays in implementing actions that might get identified, especially if there's like a short near-term or any low-hanging fruit.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"But one of the things I think whenever this was maybe looked at in the past about parks was [ORGANIZATION], and we know so much more. I know it's come up in so many of our conversations [TIME] about the housing study that was done, about our inventory levels, about... And the fact that we did deem this housing crisis.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"That would make that available. We've heard different things about the possibility of affordable housing type projects. That money could be available because, again, it doesn't have some of the restrictions that we've heard from the city attorney's office in the past.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"Just tone it down? Well I would strike the immediate and immediate, I'd say appropriate use of funds and then  [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] hereby request [PERSON] to make recommendations in a timely manner for the appropriate use of these funds to begin endowed in the housing crisis. Will work for me.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,could I make a recommendation I made a note sorry well just differently just if we just strike out the time timeline so it agreed that [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION] GPE0 hereby request that the housing crisis task force returned recommendations for appropriate use of these funds to begin addressing the housing crisis just gets rid of the immediacy term so we just delete only we add nothing so we have [TIME] on this,fayetteville
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"And so, you know, one of the things that was identified [TIME] through [LOCATION] talking about  property that's looking at rezoning was that kind of fr[LOCATION]tration around you know knowing that this workforce affordable ho[LOCATION]ing potentially what you know would exit that space and so the possible identification of potential you know projects that there would be some level of outlay or design or diligence work it's been brought up so many times you know in conversation about development codes and so you know that's obvio[LOCATION]ly a relevant  [STREET] that it can be [LOCATION]ed. I've been surprised at some of the cities in all honesty about some of the smaller amounts that they've been able to give to different organizations to do what they're calling affordable ho[LOCATION]ing and haven't been able to dig in and understand what their financial stacks are for that.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"okay okay well you know one of the things about  We were hoping when we gave them that money that it was gonna be affordable housing, but it really didn't turn out that [STREET].",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,This is going to be a decision you make. And a lot has changed over [ORGANIZATION] since those words. You've recognized the housing crisis.,fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"Hello, my name is [ORGANIZATION] and I live at [ADDRESS] and  [ORGANIZATION], I spoke with a friend who was very excited about the city declaring a housing crisis, and they asked what the task force could possibly need this money for. Code reform and land acquisition are just two guesses of mine, as someone relatively inexperienced in the area.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"Would you suggest it go to ordinance review? This is really a fairly minor change. Now every time you put a different burden upon a developer, then your affordable housing gets less affordable.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"This is a small thing, but every time you add new ones, delay the process, then you're making it harder and harder for affordable housing. But this is a minor one here, so I don't think it's very complicated. I think everybody can understand it, so it really is not one I think needs to go into this review.",fayetteville
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"Mayor, a couple of announcements. We're really pleased to announce the schedule that was published [ORGANIZATION] from long-range planning from [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]'s group about the FAC0 rezoning public meetings that are going to start.  to begin [PERSON] and there are seven meetings scheduled so we'll have a pretty intense schedule to be able to work very diligently on that housing crisis around FAC1 and then also uh city pool opens on [ORGANIZATION] that's right that's right",fayetteville

And so while I might be willing to make some allowances for children [ORGANIZATION], as a dependent child in one of the units, I might be able to be convinced on that, but ultimately I don't wanna see us adding more cars and more noise when this is really about adding affordable housing. And if you've got two ADUs and you've got a maximum of 1200 square feet, those are 600 foot units,  I think it's absolutely reasonable to limit that occupancy to one because by adding all these extra adults with their vehicles to neighborhoods, that's where we're going to start seeing a lot more opposition.",fayetteville

06_05_2018,affordable housing,"And so I think that...  THIS REALLY GIVES A SOFT [STREET] TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INCOME FOR THE HOMEOWNER.

02_18_2020,affordable housing,"well we can help them with first and [ORGANIZATION] rent, but if there's not affordable housing, you really haven't helped them in a complete [STREET].

02_18_2020,homelessness,"I've talked also at this microphone about homelessness and all of the work that we've done, and one of the backbone ways that we've been able to do the work that we've done with homelessness is because of the work that they do at [ORGANIZATION].

04_17_2018,affordable housing,"But the zoning alone is not going to create affordable housing, especially because we don't know what's going to be built there. whoever buys this is going to determine what is going to be built there.

12_19_2017,homeless; homelessness,and i know it's hard to prove or for another city to take any responsibility that that they should help but you know i do think other cities should consider helping the [INSTITUTION] here not just [ORGANIZATION] although i'm in favor of us doing it but i do think that we have a situation there where a lot of communities have folks that are that are using that shelter not just [ORGANIZATION] person who guards the the taxpayers of GPE1's dollars and cents I always like to say that [DATE] just I'd love to see a more regional approach to homelessness and in this city and all cities.,fayetteville

12_19_2017,homeless; homelessness,helping people because I know in the studies that I've done on homelessness many most Americans in this country is about one paycheck away from being homeless and so that could be anybody at any time and I think for us to step up and help people is vitally important to this city and what this city stands for and I think that's all I have to say.,fayetteville
07_16_2019,homelessness,"Going slow, getting a lot of input from different different different communities is is is really good and well thought out.

I don't know how that works, but perhaps maybe there's more latitude for the council to make a decision about  I also would like to talk about, I don't think it's too early to say let's talk about how that money will be used. The city spends a large amount of money on homelessness, and we greatly appreciate that.",fayetteville
07_16_2019,homelessness,"And we couldn't be making the progress that we are toward ending homelessness without that. And there are some situations where we have the opportunity to apply for grants and there's not match money for that. So, for instance, right now, the continuum of care, there's a two hundred forty three thousand dollar grant that we can apply for and we'll need a twenty five percent match.  which means that one of our organizations is going to have to fundraise private donors or somewhere to be able to find the match money.",fayetteville
07_16_2019,homeless,"My also perspective is that if a private citizen is going to earn money, I think that's beautiful and amazing, and I'm an entrepreneur at heart. And if them earning money is going to result in the government having to solve some problems, then I think they need to contribute a portion of that revenue that they're generating and the profit that they're generating to be able to assist the government in solving the problem that they're helping to create. So I am very happy and would love to be part of the stakeholder group and would be happy to help in any [STREET] that we can and offer our resources to be able to help convene people, get the word out, and of course connect you with homeless service providers and other housing authorities, whatever we can do.",fayetteville

11_05_2020,affordable housing,Those are going to be expensive places to live. The price per square foot is going to be quite high. So we're not developing affordable housing.,fayetteville

11_05_2020,housing crisis,"So I don't think that this is going to do any damage to property values adjacent, but I do think that it gives an opportunity for more people to find housing and  Right now we have a housing crisis and we need all hands on deck and we need to be building as much housing as we can and putting it on our major corridors where we can eventually serve it with transit, where it's within walking distance of jobs and services when we get around to fixing that corridor. This is a good [STREET] for housing. This is a great development proposal and I believe that [ORGANIZATION] made the right decision and I will vote to uphold it.",fayetteville
11_05_2020,homeless,"There was also extensive discussion about,  the issue of the park not having eyes on it and whether it created security problems. And that was reviewed by a [INSTITUTION], which a summary I think of their finding is, is that homeless people tend not to locate where there aren't services. So at this point, there isn't that much of a problem at this location.",fayetteville
11_05_2020,homelessness,"And we do not, based on what we heard from the police, based on if the topography of this hill, we do not believe that there would ever be a problem with homelessness. But on a lighter note, since the meeting started [TIME], we've been hearing coyotes in our backyard. this is the second time [ORGANIZATION] that that's happened so i feel like that anybody that wanted to put a tent on the hill would think secondly if they heard all those coyotes so we just want to support and that we appreciate all the hard work that [ORGANIZATION] did and that the parks and recreations did and we would we're in support of moving this forward thank you thank you who else would like to address us  PERSON1.",fayetteville

11_05_2020,homeless,"hi can you hear me  Yes. PERSON0 [ORGANIZATION] in Ward 2. I haven't been a part of this full conversation and I've just been listening [TIME], but there were some comments that were made and I'm not sure as part of the process when we talk about public spaces around [ORGANIZATION], but we have a fairly large homeless population and many of these folks are struggling with addiction and mental illness.",fayetteville
11_05_2020,affordable housing,"We don't have enough housing. We talk about affordable housing and we don't have enough housing and situations for permanent supportive housing for these individuals.

We're working with [PERSON]  homeless services department to be able to provide case management services for those folks that do have a voucher as part of our [ORGANIZATION]SH program. So we feel like that this is going to really add to the beauty of FAC0, as well as serve an important  function that we have come many times and said, hey, council, we need to really work on homelessness, and we really need to work on low-income housing.",fayetteville
12_20_2016,homeless,yes yes yes okay do we have any public comment on this and mr.

12_20_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Any public comment on the amendment? Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I've spent DATE0 becoming very just uncomfortable Educated on issues concerning homelessness here in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] And one of the issues that I never really thought about as someone who has been homed as an adult but was homeless as a child or a teenager [LOCATION] is the issue with creating a record in the system and so my question to you would be if I violate this ordinance and if I'm arrested for panhandling then what is the um What is the charge and what is the punishment for that crime? Is that a misdemeanor?",fayetteville
12_20_2016,homeless,"Is that a felony? Because one of the issues that faces when you become homeless and you get into the judicial system, then you have a lot harder time to get back into housing, you have a lot harder time to get back into employment, you have a lot harder time to get a lot of places. So I get that we're trying to keep people safe, But I didn't really realize, I didn't really think about until [ORGANIZATION] how this sort of thing seems like a safety issue and then could create barriers for someone to become homed again or employed again.",fayetteville

07_24_2018,affordable housing,I objected to the process then continued to receive feedback that there's not been adequate involvement from affected residents and surrounding community members. I watched the housing authorities DATE0 meeting and witnessed the many people who came to participate who contacted me later saying that they had felt that they had been somewhat disrespected.

07_24_2018,affordable housing,"But ultimately, as we move forward, I think that we need to set really high standards for our housing authority.

And I think about the goals that we set for the rest of our community, about being a healthy and safe and inclusive and welcoming community.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"Affordable housing is a crisis and when I look at the numbers in the [ORGANIZATION] report about barriers to housing whether that's overcrowding, housing affordability,  inadequate facilities whether that's not a full kitchen or bathroom or poor maintenance you know and I see that we have all these cost burdened households and all of this need and then I read such an underwhelming plan to address this overwhelming need and that indicates that to me that we need more public oversight we need greater citizen engagement and we need to do better for our citizens so I hope that's what we can do [TIME] I've  made an attempt to fill in the blanks of the original template resolution that [ORGANIZATION] had proposed.",fayetteville

07_24_2018,homeless,"At this present time, at [TIME] [DATE], there are 600 people, mostly children, on a waiting list to get homes. A lot of them are living in tents, in cars, in sheds, garages. Is there a [STREET] we can lower the standards so that a lot of people cannot, they're homeless, they can't get into a house?",fayetteville

07_24_2018,homeless,It's there completely hammering the tops of the homeless. They can't get out. We need to help them.,fayetteville
07_24_2018,homeless,"So I continue to do that because just like the gentleman who mentioned he was homeless, there are other people. If I move on or when I do move on, I want to leave in a better opportunity for others. So that's just what I want to share.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"Okay. But I do want to see a solution. What that looks like, I don't know what it is, but I do want affordable housing that, you know, I can live in and that my neighbors, the kids, and other people can live in as well.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homeless,"Over [TIME] periods. I've had leaks in my home where they've had to come in huge holes in my ceilings. But again, I have to say that it's better than being homeless.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"But obviously I'm not here to talk about city and university relations. However, I will say that I see many parallel issues in [ORGANIZATION] that I have served on that committee, particularly when it comes to fair and affordable housing, overzealous private development, neighborhood relations, and community complaints not being taken seriously until they devolve into public relations crises. I've always considered myself an outsider in [ORGANIZATION] because I am not from here, nor did I attend college here.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"These people need to ask themselves, why are they serving on this board? If it's not to help the people in need to gain and keep a safe and affordable housing, if it's not to be part of the solution to housing and homelessness, if it's not solving these problems, then they are part of the problem. In the case of the proposed and ill-conceived plan to sell [ORGANIZATION] and slowly work to centralize all the housing and residents in one area down at FAC0, which is a horrible idea, and look at [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], and that's what they all did.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,I live in LOC0 Ward 4 and As an ambassador of homelessness I have recently discovered that the reason why it's hard to remember what it's like to have grown up in poverty And experienced homelessness is because there are some feelings that you feel when you are in extreme poverty and when you are dealing with homelessness and those feelings are a feeling of hopelessness and  being out of control and quite frankly in my case my parents were making decisions that made my life suck more and so what I'm going to ask the council to do I love that you guys have brought this together because I would like for the leadership of our city to first of all like  Can you believe this many people care about public housing? That's fantastic. I'm happy to talk to you all about homelessness as well.,fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,"Housing choice vouchers we could have applied for in [ORGANIZATION] up to a million dollars in vouchers to be able to address homelessness. There's nothing in our housing authority that allows them because of their current funding restraints to be able to prioritize people experiencing homelessness. As a result, our organization, the continuum of care, which is also graded by [ORGANIZATION], also reduces points.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,"And I didn't have time to pull that up, but I think it's about 18 of the 200 points that we have an opportunity to lose because none of our housing authorities are able to prioritize homelessness. Now I understand that vouchers are not the end-all be-all. However, we've hired a strategic consultant who is beginning to help us research very creative ways to increase our housing stock.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homeless; homelessness,"Other people are doing this. It turns out you actually can solve homelessness for veterans, for chronically homeless, and housing vouchers are a major critical piece. We can increase our grant funding through the efforts of like what City of [ORGANIZATION] takes care of a lot of our homeless  grant services, we could increase that for permanent supportive housing [ORGANIZATION] by about $66,000.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,"That's what we'll be applying for at the cost of homelessness. That's about $11,000 a year, so we can help about six more people. With a million dollars in housing choice vouchers, that number gets a lot bigger.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,"So 120 people, 125 vouchers. This is real money. So if you could please...  [PERSON] add to your List of recommendations to have some type of priority for people experiencing homelessness Because that will have a direct impact on exactly how much more federal funding that we can get for our community at large",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,"Thank you I was just going to reaffirm that what you're asking us to do is to add to our resolution the request  to have the housing choice vouchers and homelessness as a priority. That's correct, yeah.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,"We've got to work all the pieces of the puzzle. So if you can specifically prioritize people experiencing homelessness as a portion of the vouchers we receive, then yes, we do have some methodology for taking care of that. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,"Thank you I  in your experience with other programs like that and  Are there additional ways to fund extended capacity so that if they had those vouchers, they could add a staff person to manage them? What's the story behind that part? So I can't speak specifically to that, but I know that on our priority, the continuum of care priority, very moved higher to the top of our list [ORGANIZATION] is what does it take to increase that capacity, and whether that's private foundation or  [ORGANIZATION], as many of you know, had a community meeting [ORGANIZATION] where we explained this is what's going on with homelessness, here's our strategic plan, we've hired a consultant, they've helped eight other cities be able to end homelessness in those eight other cities.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homeless,"Perhaps, yes. Based on the GoFundMe that funded $15,000 in [ORGANIZATION], I would say yes, sir. Ms. [PERSON], good evening, and thank you for being such an effective advocate for the homeless, the least of these in our city.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,And I know that the only [STREET] we've been able to make a change in homelessness is we went out in  the national sphere and we found a consultant that actually had helped someone else and we changed our perspective so based on their perspective I do believe they have the best meaning at heart. Thanks.,fayetteville
07_24_2018,homeless,"My reputation has been maligned. Just like you thought it was funny to say I was the [ORGANIZATION] attorney. We do have a program, [ORGANIZATION].",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,And we have 130 vouchers. And those are leased out. So we do realize homelessness is a problem.,fayetteville
07_24_2018,homeless,"I also want to let you know that [ORGANIZATION] when we have a board meeting, I announce that we have open vouchers. In fact, we just returned $40,000 to [ORGANIZATION] because those vouchers were not filled. So unless those homeless persons, and they were veterans, were brought to our office, we could not house them or we couldn't help them to find housing assistance.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homeless,"So we do recognize there is a need. Also, I would ask that you talk to [ORGANIZATION], and she can tell you about the problems you have with  finding homes for homeless people. There's more than vouchers, not having vouchers is a problem.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,We have the executive director from [ORGANIZATION] here as well. So maybe we can get that on their list to make homelessness a priority as well. Know that we have 600 and something people on our waiting list.,fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,"So although we think homelessness is a priority, what about the priority of those people who've been on the waiting list for [ORGANIZATION]? So are you going to turn these people away and say, look, I'm sorry, you're not important now. Because we don't look at somebody else.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"We also like to address Good [TIME] [ORGANIZATION] finance bill [PERSON]. I live at [ADDRESS] Ward 1 and  It says in the [ORGANIZATION] website that we promote adequate and affordable housing, economic opportunity, and suitable living environment free from discrimination in an environment that fosters self-sufficiency and community pride. When your public housing assets are all in one zip code, there is discrimination like there is now.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"to ensure so your comprehensive plan, your comprehensive plan, not theirs, talks about having available, attainable, affordable housing in all quadrants of the city. The direction in your [ORGANIZATION] master plan update is about multiple growth concept areas so that people can have affordable housing closer to employment, closer to multiple schools. So even in this particular scenario as it relates to our master plan,  We would want to see future properties in the northern part of town where we have none, in our [LOCATION] on the west side of the highway.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homeless,"And the thing is, it's hard. It's just unacceptable, you know, and I wanted to bring up what again what [ORGANIZATION] was saying about innovation I think that the first thing that we need to do is take some form of action Some have some form of sense of urgency towards this issue instead of just you know talking and you know Trying to go around these loopholes to try and you know [PERSON] as if we're trying to help these people when in reality it sounds as if someone's trying to make you know a lot of money, right So I think that, you know, innovation, innovative solutions is something that we need to, uh, you know, really harp on as she was saying, um, that being said, uh,  We're talking about the homeless issues.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homeless,"I'll also air my appreciation that this discussion is being had right now. I think I'm here specifically to talk about the [ORGANIZATION] plan and I  that the standard of our public housing should be better than, as it was noted by a resident earlier, better than being homeless. We should have higher standards for housing.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homelessness,"and so what I guess what I'm concerned about when I when I I  want to talk about no rad there is that we make sure that that [ORGANIZATION] maintains the autonomy to prioritize homelessness as was stated earlier in the plan and that that's not seated to a buyer or a ninety nine point nine nine percent interest in the company that that might choose different policies  I know that the waiting list is long and that's inconvenient, but if you've got somebody on a waiting list that's being sheltered and you've got the option to put somebody who's sleeping under the stars under a roof, then yes, I think that it would be appropriate to prioritize that first. And I want to make sure that they maintain the option to do that. So I will, I guess...  moderate some of my my rad statements with i agree if we can keep it prevent demolition so that that clears the cloud of of improvement monies",fayetteville
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"And so when I think about what we can do as policymakers, well, we can legalize affordable housing. And that means apartments, duplexes, and nontraditional housing types in all of our neighborhoods. You know, when I hear about developers not accepting rental assistance vouchers, well, as a city, we can offer developers incentives to accept a certain percentage of rental assistance vouchers.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,housing crisis,"So regardless of what we do here [TIME], the problem is bigger than this. And I want us to all stay engaged because we have a growing housing crisis in our community. Step one is fixing our housing authority and making it serve our community better and giving it the resources it needs to succeed.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,homeless,"Well, I have listened to everyone, and I do think your comments, [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON], about how to operate is very good, and that should be listened to, but that's not really part of the [ORGANIZATION] plan, right? So what I have boiled it down to is four items, conveniently numbered A, B, C, D. And the first one was prioritize homeless to obtain housing vouchers and including staff capacity if needed.",fayetteville
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"I'm sure some of you have experienced some of the same thing. But first and foremost, I think I agree with a lot of the comments here [TIME]. Right now we're working on an affordable regional housing plan that's being done regionally, and hopefully we can address affordable housing in the future.",fayetteville
11_14_2019,homelessness,"Um, but other than that, I mean, the, the job of the city clerk is to record key and, and communicate, um, there's, there's still room for me to have my own opinions as we all do, there's still room for me to advocate, um, for the things that are close to my heart, which for the most part is, um, people experiencing poverty and homelessness and, uh, equality. And, um, you know, while I won't be speaking in front of the podium, I'll still advocate for those things. Um, but also trust.",fayetteville
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"When we looked at that, as Mr. [PERSON] noted, we won't create any additional drainage problems or flooding problems to the neighborhood. We might even possibly be able to add some retainage ponds a little larger that might stop some of the flow that's going downstream, or at least retain it. We were challenged DATE0 about trying to find land that could be in the mayor's box for affordable housing.",fayetteville
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"It'll be either on the hillside or floodplain areas. So this is one of the last areas we've been able to find to look at affordable housing and doing a full mixed use again of the affordable, the [ORGANIZATION] and older, and the middle and larger homes.

07_18_2023,affordable housing,"I don't need it. Okay, I had someone tell me that this decision for you guys all boiled down between a choice between 134 estate homes that were entitled to build or affordable housing. I dare say it's a good bit different than that.",fayetteville
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"Yes, on one side of the equation is 134 unaffordable, expensive estate homes with sprinkler systems and the whole nine yards. On the other hand, is more than just affordable housing. You'd be getting things such as 100 of those would be the [ORGANIZATION] plus cottage homes where it's less than half the DATE1 car trips than normal and less usage of water and sewer than normal.",fayetteville
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"I think what you're getting is not just affordable housing, but affordable housing that's good for the city of [ORGANIZATION]. I stand by ready to ask any questions. And further, we have our engineer if you have any questions for him.",fayetteville

And this is a question that many of the residents have addressed, and it's a very fair question, especially considering the lack of affordable housing. So that's one of the things that is, well,  When I'm having conversations with the residents, that's been driving the conversation.",fayetteville
07_18_2023,affordable housing,The one thing that irritates me about all this is I've heard mentioned several times from three or four different people that a part of this  affordable housing is going to be for the elderly or someone called them the local heroes or I'm DATE0 and I [STREET] from my neighborhood into town sometimes three or four times a day so I'm just I'm not sitting just parked in front of my television I travel quite a bit I'm active And I hate to be thought of as a geriatric old geezer who just is not going to be a hardship on the system.,fayetteville

07_18_2023,affordable housing,"I think the chief concern that I have as a council member is that I don't have a price tag for those infrastructure improvements that would be linked to this development. I do not like the use of the term affordable housing for a development such as this primarily because  By the time DATE0 goes by, the cost of labor, materials, and infrastructure is such that you can't make a promise of a price tag. The only thing you know currently is the price of the dirt upon which you're going to build.",fayetteville

07_18_2023,affordable housing,"I'm just really reflective, and I think I shared this with you, of wanting to make sure going forward, anytime that we can tie to what our strategic goals and like the spending specifically to really make sure that those decisions we're making going forward, the council too has visibility with saying yes to those budgetary items. And one of the areas where, you know, as I was looking through here that I was being really mindful was thinking about our recent retreat and thinking about, you know, we talked about really wanting to make sure there was attainable, affordable housing and making sure that we have, you know, a good quality of life.

Step one and [ORGANIZATION] I listen I agree with you totally as we're seeing this high density development, and we're seeing the impact of runoff the management of stormwater the Management of the watershed the high velocity that we get with the high density development as it's running off into the watershed It all has to be managed responsibly",fayetteville

I am reluctantly in support of this because I see the need for the development, but there have been many good points mentioned about how it will  affect affordable housing because most of the housing that's up there right now in the apartments is affordable because it's older housing and I do question where those people are going to go because There aren't really they're not building new buildings that are going to absorb the people who are displaced from those units",fayetteville

I am all for the development of the university and I think it is an amazing concept to have a city that's so intertwined with its university but at the same time we are losing the affordable housing that so many of these graduate students or small families depend on because we want to satiate the university's need to expand.",fayetteville
07_16_2024,affordable housing,I know that the atmosphere and the cardinal have essentially become  dorms that are operated by third parties rather than the university.

I'm leaning toward supporting this and especially  with the city continuing to work with the neighborhood as it relates to fixing what we can as quickly as possible because those concerns are legitimate.

I believe that there are other areas in town where affordable housing could be built with less infrastructure requirements, but I don't have all of that information in front of me.

08_16_2016,affordable housing,To your question a while ago Had we not had this this change? there's two things that could happen if we had to go from a 70 foot lot to a 60 foot lot and still and [ORGANIZATION] everything up it would be expensive But if we stayed with the 70 foot lot It could possibly cost that homeowner another five to ten thousand just because of the size of the law so this allowed us the flexibility to drop a  this size lot down to create this affordable housing in the manner that we have done for [DATE] and and been embraced with [ORGANIZATION]  involved with them for over [DATE] now.,fayetteville
08_16_2016,affordable housing,"I can tell you this, they're not what I would call affordable housing. I mean, they are lower priced, but they're very high per foot, but I'm not necessarily going after the first-time homebuyer.

09_15_2020,affordable housing,"There's actually already a lot of density nearby and it's already proven difficult for some of our property owners nearby that do own animals. I 100% support having affordable housing, but I think the idea of shoving all of the lower income people into the outskirts of the city is a regressive policy.

09_15_2020,affordable housing,"I'm assuming that they mean this immediate area. So...  Because I'm experienced in canvassing and counting as an employee of [ORGANIZATION], I explored a half-mile radius around the case property for rezoning, and I found that we have about 140 current what would be considered affordable housing duplexes  in our immediate area plus the 90 that will be going in in the cobblestone edition which has been approved we think that is a wonderful project we support that that is a half a mile away so that puts about 230 duplex units [TIME] in the immediate area  There are also 30 duplex units directly across FAC0 from this ORG1 property. And we are concerned about a traffic clog right there since there is no traffic light.",fayetteville
09_15_2020,affordable housing,"For this one in particular, I appreciate the concern that  this is not the ideal [STREET] for affordable housing because of the distance and the increased transportation costs.

11_21_2023,affordable housing,"And meanwhile, you know, people can't, their kids can't find a [STREET] to live when they move out of the house and they have to move out of the city.

This has been a conversation that's been evolving over [ORGANIZATION], but also to the information and  in regard to our housing crisis and the shortage of available rentals has become much more sharpened and focused for us too when we've gotten concrete numbers from our planning department who's done such a great job in long-range planning of identifying the tremendous gap that we have.

11_21_2023,affordable housing,"So I'm going to support whatever ordinance comes out of this to regulate this more to protect the residents versus the investor class who don't even live here. They aren't the ones who have to deal with not being able to find affordable housing to deal with these bad neighbors, you know, tearing up the streets and running over people's pets and keeping people up at [TIME].

11_21_2023,housing crisis,And I just believe that we have to do we have to utilize absolutely every tool in the toolbox.

11_21_2023,affordable housing,"So I feel like if we're talking about affordable housing, the ordinance as is is more protective  of that because we do have an enforcement mechanism to shut down illegal type twos. Okay, this is an ordinance. It's on the first reading.",fayetteville

09_15_2015,homeless,"One of the grants actually will help individuals with tenant-based rental assistance, so that will be assisting them with their rental payments, and that would be for homeless individuals.

11_15_2022,affordable housing,"And so my great concern here is that once we start one in that little wonderful modest affordable housing neighborhood,  I could see the whole thing just becoming Airbnb'd out. Now we know because we're talking about the caps and everything that that's probably not gonna be possible, but I'm just concerned for that situation from the perspective of stock of modest housing in [ORGANIZATION] and then how easy it is to get to the games and all of the things that we know that people come to [ORGANIZATION] to enjoy.",fayetteville

So I fully appreciate that as well. I'm not really decided on how I'm going to vote on this yet because I think there's, you know, just because if this family doesn't own this house, it doesn't immediately become affordable housing.",fayetteville

2024-02-14,homelessness,"I am the new [ORGANIZATION] inspector general heading the offiof the inspector general, and as it was stated I'm here to present our proposed [ORGANIZATION] budget and I will start with telling you a little about [ORGANIZATION]. Basically, [ORGANIZATION] voters passed proposition d in [ORGANIZATION] establishing the [ORGANIZATION] first sheriff department oversight board, and that board proceeded to create the office of the inspector general and the whole purpose of the inspector general's office is provide independent oversight of the sheriff office. We have been assigned the government code or department code, sda to [ORGANIZATION]. The ORG2, roles and responsibilities are defined and [ORGANIZATION] charter section 4.137. then our oversight board appointed myself, [ORGANIZATION] as inspector general and on [LOCATION] we had a very beautiful administration of the oath by the legendary former mayor [PERSON] and [PERSON] which was created for oversight of the [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] continues to provide support of the ORG2 operation and assisting us with our independent investigations basically until we are fully staffed and up and running. Now, our role and responsibilities. We conduct the investigations of complaints filed against [ORGANIZATION] sheriff office employees and that includes the deputy sheriffs and their civilian employees and any third party contractors that they contract with. We also handle the investigations of any individual who dies while in the custody of the sheriff department. Additionally, once we conduct our investigations we also recommend disciplinary action to the sheriff. In terms of policies, what we are really looking to do is assist the sheriff department. We are also assisting with the development and recommending use of force policies for the sheriff department. We also look at the writing-reporting and auditing so we track and report on investigations, recommendations and outcomes and we monitor the sheriff office operations to insure compliance with the laws and policies. and we also conduct hearings. Most of those hearings roget right now are conducted by the oversight board but we have there authority to issue subpoena, administer oath, and take testimony. Now, our budget priorities. Well, our budget priorities are to recruit, hire, onboard and train staff because we are a new agency and so this is going to be one of our primary purposes getting the agency up and running. We also are tasked with developing policies and procedures, requesting positions to meet our charter mandate. And what do we need? We need investigators to investigate our sheriff office cases. We also need a senior investigator to investigate review investigations and manage the sheriff department cases. Basically the senior investigator will supervise the investigators that are conducting the individual investigations. We have a assistant chief attorney who's really responsible for helping process public records requests to review and support investigations before they come to my desk, draft agreements and just assist with the overall running of the office of the inspector general. And of course we have a executive secretary that in addition to many roles also processes payroll and purchasing and provide administrative support. what is the proposed budget for the [ORGANIZATION] budget? We are here [ORGANIZATION] to present that at this public meeting. When looking at the budget we first wanted to look at the mayor's budget instructions and so what is the primary focus of the mayor's budget for [PERSON] and one is to improve public safety and the [STREET] conditions of [ORGANIZATION]. To promote city wide economic vitality and that goes hand in hand with public safety and [STREET] conditions. Reduce homelessness and transform mental health services. Mental health service delivery and just increasing the overall accountability, equity and spending of the budget. Now, this last section is very important because we are in [PERSON], and so all departments of [ORGANIZATION] are being asked to reduce their general fund support by 10% and through [ORGANIZATION]-through [LOCATION], DATE8, with also a possible additional 5% contingency you [DATE] be asked to reduce your budget so we could be looking at most departments a 15% budget reduction. With that in mind and being a new agency, we understood is we will probably given the difficult budget cycle that we are in, we are going to have to do a phased growth of [ORGANIZATION], so instead of asking for everything that we need to be an agency up and running, we understand we will have to phase the growth of our agency. Right now we are-we looked at what is the basic amount of funding we need to get up and running? We propose 2 mill $22.163.632. We feel that request allows to bring in the number of employees to get up and running independently as a agency. Because we are being asked to take a 10% cut, that cut is reflected in the $353.080 will amount to the cut we are taking out of our budget, which would leave at the proposed $2.163.632. Now, for the number of employees, our basic proposed budget we have 13 employees, and with the 10% cut, we would lose one of those employees so it would leave us at 12 employees under the current request for funding. And so what does that 10% look like? I told we would lose one employee that would be a investigator and also our non personal service amount to about $40 thousand leaving total of $221 thousand that reflect in the 10% reduction. We also have work orders because we are not able to fully-we are not fully funded at this point because we are a new agency,b then we have to rely on [LOCATION] to support our agency-excuse me, [ORGANIZATION] to support our agency with technology that will come in the form of about $62 thousand. We also would need accounting service from the [ORGANIZATION] controller's office, $53 thousand and investigative and administrative support, $480 thousand, and because we don't have our own in-house hr department, the county is providing us the hr rep and that will amount to $147 thousand. Now, what is the-our proposed budget is where we are requesting the funding, but we understand we had to pull back in [ORGANIZATION]. We are proposing that we are not asking for any increases in materials and supplies. We are not asking for any increases in non-personnel services. And not asking for any increases in salaries and benefits. We are really trying to work within the scope of understanding that we are in a difficult budget time, but at the same time, asking for the minimum of what we need to get our agency up and running and as a result we'll be relying heavily on the [ORGANIZATION] to support us and that will be in the form of $747 thousand. That will allow us to operate as the office of the inspector general. What are the impact of the reductions? Because we are not able to be a fully operational agency at this point given the budget constrictions, what is the impact of those reductions? Well, the original budget did not include funds for central personnel and infrastructure to meet the charter mandates, so these reductions will extend our reliance on borrowed support from the [ORGANIZATION], it will delay our ability to become fully operations and impair our ability to meet our core requirements laid out by the charter, 4.137. And it will also prevent our office from adding services for the community. And with that, if there are any questions, I'm very open to answering questions or ts anyone [DATE] have. And if there are no questions and comment, I appreciate everybody who tuned into watch the presentation, and I believe that's it.",san francisco

2024-01-05,unhoused,"yes, I will say, there are cases where people just aren't satisfied, and what they're really not satisfied about is there is nothing that can really be done. These are complaints that are valid, it's frustrated, it's not that the officer did anything wrong. For example, we have immediate ated a number of cases that have unhoused population. And some feeling frustrated about calling the police and unhoused folks are still there, something like that. It's more complicated so we can talk about that in the mediation but ultimately is the encampment outside of somebody's house gone at the end? No, it's not. So there have been cased like that where people are frustrated that the underlying issue is not resolved and sometimes those are larger policy issues that volve a lot of other agencies as well. That has been the case in many situations with the 7%. Otherwise, we can remember one scenario where the complaintant did not feel like the officer was, just didn't really feel the officer, not that he did do anything, but she didn't connect with him and she didn't feel like he was owning up to what he had done, that's rare but that's an example of something that happened.",san francisco

These neighbors came to this council before and asked for that area to be downzoned, and you denied it because you have different priorities.",portland

Through this process, through the pressure from [ORGANIZATION] and then through the three different design advice review hearings, which stretched over [ORGANIZATION], I would love to know the professional fees involved in taking your architects and your lawyers through that entire process.

11_29_2018,affordable housing,"That has never been looking at anything else. I think, you know, our concern with the covenant is based on it's already very, very difficult to provide affordable housing. And so to put anything else tied to this project makes lenders very uneasy.",portland
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"And quite frankly, we need as much flexibility as possible in talking to as many lenders as possible to get projects funded. So the decision currently says that it's for affordable housing, and it refers in the modification, the adjustment criteria to the studios and the seniors, etc.,  And then the appeal pointed out that the city's definition of affordable housing is at 80% of median family income, and the appellants were asking for 60%. So is 80% – you said that you don't have any projects that are providing housing at greater than 80%.",portland
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"I would note that the decision also notes that the type of housing proposed, the amount of parking, here I'm quoting page 5, the type of housing proposed, the amount of parking and density are not relevant to the applicable historic resource review criteria. So as we read the decision and the deliberations and all of that, the references to affordable housing were different. No, I agree with that.",portland
11_29_2018,affordable housing,What I'm hearing from the applicants is they have no intention of doing any conversions. So I'm... What I'm trying to do is to acknowledge that the neighbourhood has expressed this concern and I think that they have presented their concerns in a very helpful and supportive [STREET] that is very respectful of affordable housing,portland
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"So the fact that it may not be exactly the same as every other block in the district doesn't seem valid to me. Also, I would also love to guarantee that this  is affordable housing and remains affordable housing. I have no reason to believe that it won't be.",portland
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"I also appreciate [ORGANIZATION] and their members who work very, very diligently on this, in some cases under extreme pressure. And so thanks to [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] for your support of them and for this decision, which does say that it's for 148 units, new affordable housing units, including 48 senior units and 100 units of affordable workforce housing, and that no field changes may occur.  are allowed. So I think it's quite clear in the record what's intended.",portland
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"Because it is [ORGANIZATION], I'm very confident that you are going to get the funding and that this is going to move forward. So thank you very much for all you do for affordable housing as well as ORG1 and others. I think this is a remarkable project",portland
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"and I'm looking forward to seeing it done. And I will also say Commissioner [PERSON] is out of the state  on personal business. And I know he would say if he was here that, A, he also is relieved that we got here after we said no to the other one, and also that people who live in affordable housing should not have to sacrifice design and that they get to live in really wonderful places with great design.",portland
11_29_2018,affordable housing,"But we have to also remember that it's a very complicated business to build affordable housing, very complicated. You know, as housing commissioner... I've always been baffled at the ability for these projects to actually break ground and happen because there's so many complicated funding streams, bank loans, all that stuff.",portland
09_18_2019,homelessness,"High school graduation rates, homelessness. I think we're this, as you well know, we are the second worst in the country. So there are all these symptoms of this disease that [ORGANIZATION] has not been successful in addressing primarily because we have pretty much abandoned [ORGANIZATION] an effort to deal with this disease and that's changing in the end [ORGANIZATION] Recovers is part of that change and um the the proclamation uh Mr. [PERSON] that you're issuing [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION] and shoulder uh shoulder to shoulder with the other mayors and city councils around the state is helping us turn the tide on that and um helping the public to begin to understand that we're going to have to make some important choices.",portland

09_18_2019,homelessness,"And in this category, we saw respondents showing both significant similarities and some real differences as well. So as you can see from the chart, respondents, regardless of race and age, chose increasing housing affordability and addressing homelessness, that was one response, as their top budget priority. So that's the dark orange bar that you see across each category up at the top.",portland
09_18_2019,homelessness,"So we did note that increasing housing affordability and addressing homelessness was the top budget priority. The second most cited budget priority was investments in city streets, sidewalk, and transportation. That's the yellow bar that you see across the different categories.",portland
09_18_2019,homelessness,We asked this entirely new question that asked respondents to identify the city's greatest challenges. And here we heard loud and clear homelessness is perceived to be the top challenge facing [ORGANIZATION] according to our respondents. This perspective was shared across every race and age group.,portland
09_18_2019,homelessness,"You can see that by the tall blue bars in each category. [PERSON] was also cited in multiple sections of the survey, including as a reason why people moved and why they did not participate in parks programs. Also, from this question, it's interesting.",portland
09_18_2019,homelessness,"And there we noted that homelessness and drugs were the most commonly mentioned topics in that category, in that field. All right, I'm going to turn it over to [ORGANIZATION] for a few of the findings on civic participation. Great, so hopefully the maps are a little easier to look at.",portland
09_18_2019,homeless,"It could be just how the questions asked. I often wonder, as I look at some of these slides, if you'd ask the question, if the homeless problem didn't exist, how would you feel about the following statement? Because I feel like the urgency and the magnitude of the homeless crisis is probably overlaying all of these responses.",portland
09_18_2019,homelessness,"So one opportunity could be to create and support standardized practices or policies around program evaluation. Some examples of high priority areas identified by the survey are listed on this slide. The dissatisfaction with the city's response to homelessness despite significant program expansion and racial disparities in access to jobs, despite economic development programming specifically for communities of color.",portland
09_18_2019,homelessness,"And I think a number of these questions have to be reviewed, particularly around homelessness, so that there's no prompt in the question, that there is a more generic question, and therefore we get an answer that's based on people's response to a generic question, not to one that's a little loaded up. I don't know anymore what the term trust in government refers to.

They have a choice if they're a purely commercial building.",portland
12_06_2017,affordable housing,"I'd want to know more about that because the whole thing has been framed in terms of a benefit around affordable housing. And one of the things I don't fully understand is what the off-ramps are that could result in height without that benefit.

12_06_2017,affordable housing,"around FAC0 because, to me, that's one of the few compelling parts of this. And, again, that would just be a straight commercial building, which is somewhat we see mostly a lot of mixed use now. And most of our projects are triggering affordable housing.",portland

12_06_2017,affordable housing,"The affordable housing set-aside was increased from the long-standing 30% to 42% for the life of the district.

And by my count, in the course of [ORGANIZATION], you have closed 443 units of affordable housing in our community, which is probably a record. One is the largest housing development that we've ever done of its kind.",portland

11_17_2016,affordable housing,"We understand that we have to minimize parking to accommodate increased density, reduce housing costs, and foster use of mass transit. We have the residential infill project, the recently adopted inclusionary zoning, and the recently passed affordable housing bond that should create more affordable housing. We strongly believe that the city should give these new tools a chance to work before eliminating minimum parking requirements.",portland
11_17_2016,affordable housing,"We don't need more. What we do need is more thoughtful and active approaches to managing the abundant supply so that other worthy things like affordable housing, transit access, [STREET] trees, and safe passage for bikes and pedestrians can be provided within and close to our mixed-use corridors.

Mayor [PERSON], in all due respect, I understand that there's a concern about affordable housing and the potential speculative project that might come in there.

10_05_2016,homelessness,"It's brought our partners to the table over [ORGANIZATION] and bringing some of the most creative, collaborative work that our community has put to addressing homelessness in [LOCATION]. And it's been in the face of, as [ORGANIZATION] talked about, one of the most challenging housing markets we've ever experienced.

10_05_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And this council's support for and direct involvement in that process has been crucial. So [DATE] we'll report...  our outcomes from [ORGANIZATION] of implementing those new strategies with the additional investments. Lest we bury the lead, on the first slide here in your packet, we were able to increase our overall service investments by more than $7 million [LOCATION] with a focus on placing people into housing from homelessness, preventing people from becoming homeless in the first [STREET],  expanding our shelter capacity, and focusing very clearly on racial equity in homelessness.",portland
10_05_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And across all of those goals, we were able to exceed our initial goals for services. placing more than 4,600 people from homelessness into housing over the course of [ORGANIZATION], preventing more than 9,[ADDRESS], and helping more than 6,600 people access emergency [TIME] shelter. So [PERSON] we'll go into detail on some of those outcomes.",portland
10_05_2016,homelessness,"So just to remind you of some of the work that we did to model out that question of what would it take, in this graph, the orange line is the key line. It's a look at our estimated unmet need for people experiencing homelessness, unmet housing need among people experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION], starting in [ORGANIZATION] with more than 4,000 people at [LOCATION] who still had an unmet housing need. And your overall charge to our collective effort was to reduce that unmet need by half over the course of DATE2.",portland
10_05_2016,homelessness,"In answering then what would it take, we looked at the green line, which is how many additional people would we have to begin to [STREET] from homelessness into housing, as well as the blue line.  which is how much would we have to begin to increase our homelessness prevention efforts in order to reduce that unmet need by half over that time. And during [ORGANIZATION], the answer to that question, what would it take, was at a minimum beginning by starting to [STREET] 750 additional people into permanent housing above what we had done in [LOCATION]. And this is what we were actually able to do.",portland
10_05_2016,homelessness,"So in [ORGANIZATION], we were able to [STREET] more than 4,600 people into permanent housing from homelessness. Again, the goal had been to increase by 750 over [LOCATION], over our prior baseline, sorry. And that 4,600 actually represents an increase of 1,200 people.",portland
10_05_2016,homelessness,"But our overall system goals are very much in the context of existing and persistent racial disparities in homelessness. Most significantly here, you see that African Americans make up about 7% of the population in [ORGANIZATION], but make up about 24% of people experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]. So with these persistent and real disparities in homelessness, we're",portland
10_05_2016,homelessness,"And across the bottom in orange, you see the percent of people experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] who are of that racial group. So in general, what you want to see for our communities of color is that the percent of people placed into housing should be higher than their percent of people experiencing homelessness in order for us to begin to address the racial disparities that are there. And there, what you see nearly across the board is that in [ORGANIZATION], we were able to increase the number of people of color who were placed into permanent housing, as well as either maintaining or increasing the percentage of people who are placed into housing.",portland
10_05_2016,homeless,"We were also able in [ORGANIZATION] to maintain our overall prevention effort. We newly served 4,100, more than 4,100 people with additional assistance to prevent them from becoming homeless. And we were able, both newly served and people who had been served in [LOCATION], able to serve 9,300 people total with prevention assistance.",portland
10_05_2016,homelessness,"And just to be clear, the tool we use there mostly is the short-term rent assistance? Correct. And that's why consistently we hear from you that's one of the best investments we can make to prevent people from falling into homelessness, rapidly rehouse.",portland
10_05_2016,homelessness,"And so that dollar is really one of our best tools. Is that right, [ORGANIZATION]?  That dollar plus some of the staffing capacity at organizations that can engage with the families, negotiate challenges that are going on in their tenancies with landlords to avoid receiving evictions. So it's a combination of the short-term assistance dollars and also that housing retention or homelessness prevention staffing capacity that our organizations have.",portland
10_05_2016,homelessness,"Thank you. And again, to look briefly at the prevention outcomes by race and ethnicity, recently at a [ORGANIZATION] meeting, we heard testimony from several of our culturally specific providers who talked about significant differences in how communities of color experience homelessness. Many are doubled or tripled up rather than accessing emergency shelter.",portland
10_05_2016,homelessness,"And so our prevention resources are incredibly important for these communities of color, especially when they're delivered in alignment with our anti-poverty systems. So here the increases in the number and percent of African Americans and Latinos that were served with prevention is really helping to stem the inflow that's driving so much of the persistent racial disparities in homelessness. Thank you.",portland
10_05_2016,homelessness,"And now to talk a little bit about safety off the streets or shelter options, I want to orient you just a little bit to this slide. The dashed line in sort of the yellow color is the baseline capacity going into [ORGANIZATION], the number of shelter beds and transitional housing beds that we had available in our community. The blue line up at the top represents our estimate of the number of people who would be experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] on [TIME].",portland
10_05_2016,homelessness,"To the degree that the blue line is above the dashed line, you'll see [STREET] homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]. There isn't a shelter bed for every person. So we'll get the [ORGANIZATION] worked out.",portland
10_05_2016,homeless,"So that's a 40% increase overall in the number of people that we were able to serve through emergency shelter. And just the last number that I'll leave you with is, I think, a critical number and one to let soak in for a little bit. This is the overall number of people who were served across our entire system of homeless services, both people who were newly served and who continued to receive services who begun in services in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_05_2016,homeless; homelessness,"So one additional piece of information to make sure you have is that when we're identifying these numbers, these are just the organizations that put their data into our homeless management information system. That means they typically receive some kind of public funding. There are also many other organizations that don't receive public funding doing work with people experiencing homelessness.  whose data is not represented here.",portland

11_09_2017,homeless,"We've also had speakers share about volunteer opportunities at the hospital with [ORGANIZATION] groups or nonprofit [ORGANIZATION] groups and different services provided for mental health and homeless vets. Mostly we advocate for city employees, people trying to get a job with the city. Sometimes it's difficult for them to translate their experiences from the military into what the city [ORGANIZATION] looks for, for qualifications for the job.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"they are asking to have their property exempted from the proposed zoning provisions they have also threatened to sue the city if city council refuses to grant this exemption but they have not stopped with the threat of a lawsuit they have cleverly attached their personal agenda to several real and difficult housing issues the city currently faces  They have woven the desire for personal gain into a narrative of affordable housing, gentrification, and not in my backyardism. Because these are high-level housing agenda issues, their efforts have fallen on receptive ears. They have been able to enlist media outlets and two respectable nonprofits to spread misleading information under the umbrella of their chosen narrative.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"I'm currently working with [ORGANIZATION] on a potential affordable housing project in the neighborhood. while i'm working with ORG1 and care deeply about affordable housing the reason i'm here is to address the greater impact that down zoning in the alphabet district can have on this neighborhood other inner city neighborhoods and our metro area as a whole not only is allowing for higher densities in our inner city neighborhoods a staple of sustainable city development it is also a key ingredient in our effort to provide housing for our low and middle income citizens  While it is never the right time to restrict access to neighborhoods that offer connections to jobs, public transit, shopping, and services, it is especially short-sighted to do so at a time when our city is struggling to provide housing, and so many are in need of such a [STREET] to live. As the owner of an architecture firm that has received several awards for our work in historic preservation, I care deeply about the historic fabric of the neighborhood and believe historic resource sources should be protected.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"This will not solve the affordable housing problem, to say nothing of tearing at the visual fabric of the neighborhood and the cachet of PDX.

Having supported her testimony, I would like to add some other ideas.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"It is listed as number 17 on [ORGANIZATION]. The ownership's ultimate vision for these properties includes a five-story industrial flex building to accommodate small space users, such as startup minority and women-owned businesses, as well as build much-needed affordable housing as part of mixed-use development. And as you know, brownfield remediation of these properties will cost ownership hundreds of thousands of dollars in  While we appreciate the city's need to dedicate an adequate inventory to land zoned for the exclusive employment-related uses, we would still prefer the land to remain zoned EX so that the buildable development justifies the projected cleanup costs of the site.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"um so i'm uh i'm thinking and i think some of the planning commission members are taking the same [STREET] that the removal of the parking requirements in mixed-use zones would help that um to help you know allow for more affordable housing um  up zoning from [ORGANIZATION] to FAC0. I support the up zoning of all the areas throughout, mostly southeast, where the comp plan designation has been FAC0 for DATE0, and now the planning bureau has decided  studied them and decided which areas could be up zoned to our 2.5 i support that the ground floor height bonus that the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood spoke about i support that bonus which allows for taller ground floors and you know gives you an extra five feet on the on the height of the building but also an extra five feet on the step back because it wouldn't make sense to have the floor plates all jogged back down at the rear to accommodate have not that not have the additional height there but have it on the main part of the building  I support the major city bikeway designation on FAC1 from FAC2 to [PERSON].",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"And it would also help us with the developmental process to be able to add some affordable housing for marginalized communities like veterans, immigrants.  for seniors, for African-Americans to come back into the community. So we thought about why not come here in front of you and see if you are really serious about the city's efforts to, you know, to –  to combat the ills of gentrification and see whether or not you could, with the stroke of a pen, say, okay, we're going to give you this additional entitlement. So that's the nature of my coming here to testify in front of you [ORGANIZATION] as an African American and a person that's a strong advocate of  reversing the ills that have happened to us from a historical perspective, and I trust that you will do the right thing.",portland

My husband and I have lived in an apartment in northwest [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], and we raised our twin sons in the neighborhood, [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. I think I know I don't need to tell you about the housing crisis, but I'm going to mention the number again, which we keep updating.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"So it seems to me with all that we're dealing with, and we've said we need many different approaches, a private owner making land available, one of our very best nonprofits coming together to do this. And I think the bigger issue of whether it's  three to one or two to one is, is this a neighborhood that should have more housing and should it have more affordable housing? And,  Is compatibility with a historic district really defined by height?",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"Our proposal is to retain that resource.  and build around it on the site. So again, kind of a hybrid model of meeting both the historic preservation goals, but also the affordable housing goals. I mean, you have [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm a resident of northwest [ORGANIZATION]. I'm here to oppose any down zoning in [ORGANIZATION], and in particular the down zoning being requested south of [PERSON]. I entirely agree with the testimony you've heard from affordable housing advocates.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"We have carefully been planning for [ORGANIZATION] a mixed-use apartment project that would cater to those needs, both for short- and long-term housing needs with walking distance to FAC0. The proposed zoning change would actually cut our plans in half.  which would limit the amount of housing we could provide for those in need, and then also negatively affecting our plans to incorporate affordable housing in the project as well. So we respectfully request for the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] parcels on FAC1 to be up-zoned instead of down-zoned to [ORGANIZATION]2 or 3.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"And so this down zone, you know, you've heard a lot about affordable housing [ORGANIZATION]. I'm not going to reiterate that. As a commissioner of [ORGANIZATION], I am fully aware of the depth of the problem.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"As a developer, I also understand that by constricting the yield out of a piece of property, the ability to cover debt –  when you have to reduce that yield, becomes very questionable. And so likely no affordable housing other than requirements for inclusionary zoning, which I think can be very positive if there are appropriate incentives for it. What we really want to see is a CM3 designation on this property to allow a really well-developed project that allows for commercial services as well as  both market rate and affordable housing.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"We are not talking about a huge swath of this city. They contain, however, the majority of our historic resources. So giving them a little protection is not going to stymie our quest for affordable housing.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"Furthermore, it makes little sense to me that advocates pick some of the most expensive real estate or land in the city in which to locate affordable housing. That kind of goes against my logic. And I kind of have to throw out the question, why is the central city, which is already dense, bearing the bulk of the burden of adding more density while outlying neighborhoods that are crying for new and better development seem to be going wanting here?",portland
10_13_2016,housing crisis,"But we have a housing crisis, as you well know. The number is 23,295 units that we need in this city. We need this for people of extremely low income, which means you make less than $15,000 or $13,000 a year.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"And for [ORGANIZATION], we've added almost 1,200 units. Our biggest dislike about that is none of it's affordable. Right now, we have over 800 regulated affordable housing units in our neighborhood.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"And we have a lot of market affordable housing that we're afraid we're going to lose in that core area. You know, [ORGANIZATION] is the only plan outside the central city that has an affordable housing bonus. We have an affordable housing bonus in our plan district.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"A few blocks north of the site that keeps being talked about, you could build up to 7 to 1 FAR and 120-foot tall building if you do affordable housing. We've been promoting affordable housing for a long time. We are not NIMBYs.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"But I want to start more generally. I believe that providing affordable housing is one of the most important things we can do. In fact, that may be my largest political donation ever to support the bond campaign.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"However, I'm really concerned that at this time of crisis, affordable housing and its need has begun to trump every other goal. And I want to remind us that we're planning for [ORGANIZATION]. And while we have a crisis [LOCATION], we should not allow one goal of our many to trump everything else, to abandon our system of corridors and centers, to do other things that are not consistent, because we need to all work together and continue to do that.",portland
10_13_2016,affordable housing,"Other options would be to extend the city's inclusionary zone affordable housing bonus to that site so they can get the density done. Finally, we could also include the [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing bonuses and extend them into the historic district. But the most important thing is that the zoning reflect the closest reality to what's desired, what's there [ORGANIZATION], and does not mislead people.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"And the distinction would be that would allow potentially those campuses to entertain the idea of building potentially affordable housing that wasn't directly affiliated with their campus, which is something that [ORGANIZATION] is considering as an option. I'll move. Or let me just –  It would also allow them theoretically to develop market rate housing and use that proceeds to subsidize some part of their operation.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"My guess is, from a public policy point of view,  And given the locations of the campuses, there'll be tremendous interest if there is to be other housing, housing for other than faculty and students, to make it affordable because there is a shortage of affordable housing generally for people who are students or full-time minimum wage workers. So I have confidence in the political process. So keep going if you want.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"The idea being that we know that older adults like to be adjacent to academic institutions, take advantage of programming, so perfect case would be within the university district. We also know that we have some churches, historic churches in this city that are losing their congregations, and what better [STREET] if they were to develop a parking lot or something than to have housing for older adults that then could be part of that community. So that's not before us, but I am personally intrigued by the idea particularly of housing for older adults and affordable housing on campuses because of the other amenities that campuses offer the residents.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"Okay. You heard some testimony from affordable housing providers and some property owners concerned about the loss of density in such a close-in urban neighborhood, and then you heard from [ORGANIZATION] and historic preservation advocates that the two-to-one was more appropriate. ORG1 recommendation kind of split and kept four-to-one on the south side of the district, which is close to the [ORGANIZATION] station and where there is a slightly higher preponderance of –  of bigger historic buildings.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"And then option C is a –  A different version, which would remove the parking requirements from residential developments, but only if the building is following one of several paths that includes affordable housing, either bonuses or the future mandatory or voluntary inclusionary housing provisions. And so this relates to the upcoming consideration of that ordinance. So, Mayor, can I make a suggestion?",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] brings the affordable housing piece into the equation. And then, depending on the outcome of that, bring Motion B in, because that's essentially Motion C stripped of the affordable housing component. I would like to have an up-or-down vote on [PERSON]",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"And so that would still allow those projects that are using the voluntary bonuses to get a relief on the parking, but projects that didn't do that. An example might be if someone tried to build a building just based on the standard code  Without using the bonuses for affordable housing, they would trigger the parking. If they used the bonuses, they wouldn't.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"He's just not sure that this is the right process to achieve the goal. Here's my ultimate concern, [ORGANIZATION]. Every time we've talked about how to seize an opportunity to leverage affordable housing of late, and I'll cite to the example on transit corridors, where we said, hey, maybe we could down zone and then give people bonuses as a [STREET] of getting affordability.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,And I think that the idea that we should preserve a policy that increases the cost of housing as part of a strategy to raise more affordable housing is as convoluted as it is now. I understand that. I guess I want to respond as well.,portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"Other comments? Commissioner, what we'll have to do to have an effective IT program is to have a rule and a package of incentives to make it economically feasible to create housing that includes affordable housing at the lower end. If you take cost of parking off the top at the beginning, you get as much closer to making the affordable housing economically viable as you do if you take it off somewhere down the line.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor. Rather than guessing and using our own intelligence to figure what might or might not happen, I think we should do 51, which is the transportation demand management, go look at the whole issue, have the different discussion on inclusionary zoning and have this as certainly one of the options for what we can give developers in return for affordable housing. We need to have a separate discussion on parking alone.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"I mean, we heard from 24 people. That doesn't seem a lot, given the far-reaching nature of it. Just so we're clear, there was a lot of testimony about the need –  to leverage affordable housing, and I've just come up with a tool, not a perfect tool, but a tool to make sure that the benefit we're conferring results in a public benefit by linking it to [ORGANIZATION], which, again, from staff's interpretation of this, will mean in virtually every case this is exercised, but this becomes one of the tools.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"And as I read it, Commissioner [PERSON] says that that's when there's affordable housing and when it's near transit. Right. And it also includes all the errata that we have put together in this notebook.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,"Well, as all my colleagues know, the inclusionary housing legislation that passed in [ORGANIZATION] requires that local governments provide some sort of an offset to the development for affordable housing under the law. And as we move into considering and debating this in [ORGANIZATION], I think it's very important that we hold on to this powerful incentive we do have to get developers to,  take advantage of the inclusionary zoning, whether it's the voluntary 60% of median income or below, or the required 80% of median income. But as the modeling and everything shows, being able to waive on-site parking is a powerful, powerful tool, and we need to keep it for the use for inclusionary housing.",portland
11_22_2016,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] did you hear that that's you i know i didn't i haven't been hearing the uh the call um i what we recommend that we're going to have irrational requirements that we can then waive to encourage affordable housing uh we should also adopt the requirements that everybody get a pony when they get a new house and then we can wait back for affordable housing um  Anything else?,portland
11_07_2018,affordable housing,"And we can go on and on with things that happened [TIME]. I would like to take a moment and thank the [ORGANIZATION] voters for supporting affordable housing. We had two ballot measures [ORGANIZATION], ballot measures 102 and 26-199.",portland
11_07_2018,affordable housing,"Each almost got to 60%, which if you go back, and [ORGANIZATION] is nodding, and [ORGANIZATION] follows this closely.

We've monetized spaces that actually, [ORGANIZATION], used to be available for affordable housing, and we have greatly contributed to the crisis in our community by giving people financial incentive to do short-term rentals over long-term rentals, and it isn't as if we had a lot of capacity to begin with.",portland

It provided a form of affordable housing in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, and even [ORGANIZATION] have passed, that unit has turned over once or twice, and it continues to be half to a third the cost of any other home in that neighborhood. For rentals, it's a little bit different scheme, but it's very similar.",portland
11_18_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"They provide affordable housing options in neighborhoods that have very few choices. We really do have a housing crisis, and  We need to have little houses have to be part of the toolbox for that. And I want to share that [PERSON], and that's why I have this little handout for you, there's not much data out there about how ADUs are used.",portland
11_18_2015,housing crisis,"But most ADUs are almost certainly used for long-term housing options. And we need those choices in a housing crisis. PERSON0, in fairness, we actually don't know the answer to that question.",portland
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"You are not typical. The kinds of co-housing things you advocate for, the kinds of affordable housing options, all the things that you come before us are not typical of your peer group. And I say that as a compliment.",portland
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"Almost 20% of them are rented for zero or like 500 bucks a month. And we need stuff like that. That's affordable housing, unsubsidized in any ongoing [STREET] by government, for small units where household sizes tend to be small.",portland
11_18_2015,housing crisis,"We have neighborhoods that are at risk of becoming only affordable to millionaires, and these are sort of the kinds of housing we need more of in a housing crisis. PERSON0, we're not going to be taking up the [ORGANIZATION] issue [ORGANIZATION], but at some point I would love to have your thoughts about, as we're considering sunsetting the [ORGANIZATION] waiver, as to whether you think we should only sunset it on those units where the owner is willing to make the unit affordable. and is there some [STREET] to to to link those two well the other option there might be to have the ORG1 waiver uh you know we we've had trouble and PERSON1 and PERSON2 were explaining we had trouble in the past with regulations that were incenting people to do a workaround this is just an office it's not really a housing unit and and they were even carrying out sync agreements about whether or not you're installing a sink you know it got crazy and convoluted but",portland
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"Therefore, there's more flexibility in terms of being able to build ADUs that are cheaper because you don't have to do custom design for each and every unit. So the amendment is – the unintentional consequences are that it incentivizes 800 square foot ADUs, which means that –  more ADUs will cost more and will have to be used more for income-generating properties, whereas right now greater, 20 percent, potentially greater, are used for no-cost rental for family members, for friends. It's a form of organic affordable housing that doesn't require government subsidy other than the [ORGANIZATION] waiver, which I would love to see extended.",portland
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"I don't think there's any stats that really back up what these  hypotheses are there's media and stories that have conflated [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] but the reality is a lot more being used for affordable housing and there's a lot of anecdotes to support that you just have to go digging for them and i and i as somebody who speaks with and deals with  Probably more AD owners than anybody else. I can tell you, you know, ORG2 is used in some cases, but it's definitely not the majority.",portland
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"They are solutions for people for income generation. They are solutions for affordable housing. If we open up this model, we can create actually infill, not upfill, communities, people that walk by each other, engage, and actually engage with their neighbors.",portland
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"But we buy and purchase land, and many of us, it is...  the only thing we have to call home. And if you have to stay at your home by allowing others to come in and support you by creating a basement unit, or you use the $40,000 on a [ORGANIZATION] to help convert the garage into something that helps generate income for the city and affordable housing, the reason [PERSON] is unique is because development of anything is difficult. And the ORG2 has been the option for the individual to create somewhat affordable development in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"We do not have a solution for it. There is no opportunity for affordable right now for most people, and the developers have not gotten on board. The issue is whether the affordable housing is placed within the setback.",portland
11_18_2015,affordable housing,"It means that whenever I apply for a [STREET] to live, like [ORGANIZATION] when the investment firms bought my affordable housing and kicked us out and I had to go get a much more expensive [STREET], wherever I go to move, I have to write a letter. What I found was interesting in that, I want to do more research, was it seems as though the inner ring of [ORGANIZATION], actually all of those management companies have come together and said, we're not going to take...  felons no matter what. And then you go out further and further.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"New transit is critical to bringing better access to more housing, education, and job opportunities. That said, we know displacement risk from the rising cost of living and lack of affordable housing threatens the existing economic and cultural diversity in the corridor. That's already happening.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"We have [ORGANIZATION], the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] is the [LOCATION] and [PERSON] Director for [ORGANIZATION]. And with her is [ORGANIZATION], a ORG2 Tenant Leader.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"We need to work to determinately eliminate and specifically eliminate these disparities and create better outcomes for all the people in our communities. We have an opportunity right now, which doesn't come along very often, to undo a past history and do the right thing moving forward. We know that buying land,  for future affordable housing and purchasing existing apartments, buildings, other housing, naturally occurring affordable housing in those areas throughout the corridor and the preferred alternative will help preserve affordability and opportunity and should be our top priorities in this strategy.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Great. Hi, I'm PERSON0. I'm an executive director at [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And after doing work in [ORGANIZATION] and now really doing a lot of work in [PERSON], I feel like I understand that on a whole new level. So I just want to put that out there, too, that this is an amazing opportunity for us to look at a...  with a regional effort. [ORGANIZATION] starts with a senior property in GPE2.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"so I feel like I really have based on those two processes some good insight on the interconnection between transit and housing and in particular our focus which is affordable housing we know how important it is to be sure that folks who are currently  living along the corridor can benefit from this incredible upcoming public investment. At the same time, we know that we're expecting another 10,000 people along the corridor by [ORGANIZATION]. So with those things in mind, it just really, really speaks to the importance of having this strategy adopted.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So I'm going to say kind of three things that I'm excited to ask about and want to thank you ahead of time for your leadership on these things. One is to be sure that we are tying up land now and prioritizing it for housing and in particular affordable housing. That's  As [ORGANIZATION] already mentioned, and as you know, this is our moment.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"I know that [ORGANIZATION] has set aside some urban renewal areas in the [ORGANIZATION] and downtown [ORGANIZATION] as well. And in the [ORGANIZATION] area have a set aside, a large set aside for affordable housing. And then fund the request from the community-based organizations active in the corridor to continue to engage low-income households.",portland
10_04_2018,housing crisis,"I have a question for [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], and you may have similar answers, so you don't have to do it in stereo, but I want to put the question out there. We have a housing crisis, and we're approaching it through housing,  Multiple strategies. The mayor has taken the unprecedented step of taking all development-related bureaus under his portfolio.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So from the moment an idea is hatched to the ribbon-cutting, he has all the bureaus that touch that project, and he has said that he wants to see a streamlining of the permit process. He wants to see affordable housing go to the head of the line. He wants to see more concierge services.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So I would just want to give each of you an opportunity to advise us as to whether, in thinking about an equitable housing strategy for [ORGANIZATION], which is a big deal, whether we should be compromising on those values. So if I –  So if I might, I'll start. Because as you know, I don't actually work in the affordable housing area, so I'm not actually going to address the affordable issue.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Around this value proposition of opportunity, I think actually the case in point, what we were able to uncover with [ORGANIZATION] was that there's a lot of housing opportunity in apartment buildings that are currently people are renting from, in terms of they're called the naturally occurring affordable housing, and preserving those units, getting those buildings up to code and ensuring that folks have stable rents, as [ORGANIZATION] was saying,  These are family-sized units. The complex right next to the mosque on FAC0, they're three-bedroom units, right? These are actually apartments that families can continue to grow in and actually have multiple generations going to FAC1 across the [STREET].",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And then we add that to the plan. Hopefully you'll like what you see and you'll be able to pass it. And with that adoption, we look forward to being able to do some core work around what I was talking about with the naturally occurring affordable housing preservation work.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And those, Shannon will give a little more detail about, but they would roughly, between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], double the amount of regulated affordable housing in the corridor to about 1,600 units. Now, the stretch targets that we created were designed in a totally different [STREET]. They were designed to achieve big policy goals.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"With careful planning, securing parcels for new development, and targeted efforts to prevent displacement and mitigate cultural displacement, the strategy aims to achieve equitable growth along the line. In [ORGANIZATION], we believe that [ORGANIZATION] has the means and the resources to achieve 300 to 350 new units of affordable housing along the corridor. To achieve the stretch targets will require additional resources.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], thank you. We as a city have unfortunately learned very hard lessons when we have failed to prioritize affordable housing and the prevention of displacement when we make our transportation infrastructure investments. The strategy is more than just acknowledging those mistakes, but we are actively taking steps and adding resources to realize this plan.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"We also need to ensure that we are maximizing the development potential for affordable housing along the corridor. With the announcement of the light rail line and its alignment, available land for sale becomes scarce, and the market begins to speculate. So securing land early, as you have heard, for future development is imperative.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"A key partner in the implementation of the strategy and the lead agency on the light rail line, [ORGANIZATION], has worked with ORG1 on a memorandum of understanding to ensure the availability of land to reach the goals in this strategy. We've had a series of extremely productive and collaborative discussions to reach the outlines of a Memorandum of Understanding, which will be presented to you with your action [ORGANIZATION] on the locally preferred alternative. I'd like to thank the entire team at [ORGANIZATION] for prioritizing these discussions, their shared commitment with ORG2 to prioritize affordable housing.  ensuring that families of all incomes can benefit from the fast, affordable transit service that will link these families to jobs and educational opportunities.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"They will offer excess property to [ORGANIZATION], enough to accommodate 600 to 700 new units of affordable housing. These sites will be sold at a discounted value, the equivalent of the federal portion of the appraised value, in accordance with federal transportation authority rules. And [ORGANIZATION] will, in collaboration with ORG2, look to maximize development potential adjacent to other light rail lines as well as [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And you've heard a lot about the critical importance of preserving and increasing affordable housing for residents along [ORGANIZATION]. And as Commissioner [PERSON] mentioned, we're also mindful of the potential impacts on small local businesses. So as you'll see from this slide, we estimate that there are almost 1,000 businesses located within a quarter mile of the corridor whose employees and access to customers stand to benefit from proximity to the transit improvements.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] slide, please. Thank you. One of those funding sources that would provide tools for both affordable housing and affordable commercial space is tax increment finance.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"With a set-aside policy of 45% for affordable housing, the larger district as modeled would yield approximately $54 million for [ORGANIZATION] for their investments, which could fund an estimated 240 affordable housing units. These could also provide resources. The remaining $66 million could also provide resources through ORG1 to provide business loans and grants and investments in affordable commercial space, and it could also help support the local match for the light rail line itself.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So it's important to not only talk about the affordable housing, but also the market rate targets we have and the growth management aspect of this. On the publicly owned properties, we've identified a number of them that already are in public ownership that could have a potential for redevelopment on the line, and we're exploring scenarios on those sites. One, FAC0, we understand that both [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] jointly own some land that is under that current highway infrastructure.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Also at FAC0, if FAC1 has a light rail station that causes redevelopment of that site, there's the potential if we went vertical with that to put a couple hundred additional units there. [ORGANIZATION] is interested in development of affordable housing on the [ORGANIZATION] campus, a short walk from the FAC2 station. The transit improvements make it possible for them to consider reallocating land from parking into more intensive uses.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] acknowledged the strategy in [ORGANIZATION] as a toolbox of potential tools to address the need for more affordable housing. Even before the strategy was complete, [ORGANIZATION] has been taking action. In [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] voters approved an urban rental district, and [ORGANIZATION] voters have to approve it.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], which is planned to have two southwest corridor light rail stations,  Our first allocation of [ORGANIZATION] money in that district was to support an affordable housing, community partner for affordable housing project that [ORGANIZATION] mentioned earlier that should be breaking ground in [ORGANIZATION]. Also in this area known as [PERSON], we've done a rezone with very streamlined development code. Actually, no parking minimums are required in this area.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Okay. We're also kicking off a metro-funded project to figure out how we can implement this urban renewal district in an equitable manner. Other things, as was mentioned earlier, in [ORGANIZATION] our city council approved a local SDC exemption for regulated affordable housing for 80% [ORGANIZATION] and below.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And what do you estimate is the need in the city of [ORGANIZATION] for affordable housing defined as below 80% of [ORGANIZATION]? Well, the strategy, you know, we have a goal of 600 to 800 units, but the need is higher than that, we realize. So our goal is to get 600 to 800 units.  built in [ORGANIZATION], but the need is greater than that.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,One of our last pieces of vacant land is actually under construction to build 240 units of affordable housing in partnership with [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you very much. I'm PERSON0 from [ORGANIZATION].,portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"We recognize that affordable housing is both a city and a regional-wide priority. We need to work creatively and aggressively to address that. And [ORGANIZATION] is leaning into that hard, and we're willing to move forward with that.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And we show that through a couple different methods. One is the Memorandum of Agreement on Affordable Housing. So as [ORGANIZATION] purchases property,  for the project where we have to stage property.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"When we're done with the project, we look to dispose of that property. And so through the agreement that we've reached with [ORGANIZATION] in principle, and it's an agreement that we have both with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION] to do affordable housing on remnant parcels that are left over by the project. And this...  essentially outlines what [ORGANIZATION] talked about before.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"We're committing up to 600 to 700, locating and identifying 600 to 700 locations for 600 to 700 affordable housing units along the alignment. We're looking to write down the value of that to the degree that we are allowed to by law, federal law, returning that federal share back to [ORGANIZATION], who's the principal contractor. principal funder of it.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So this is extending what we're doing now.  to what we will be doing hopefully in the future when we build the [ORGANIZATION] line and I think that also builds on our low income transit our low income fare so getting people to and from work in a more effective [STREET] really improves both that access and where people can live so [ORGANIZATION] really feels like it's part of the solution  Now, [ORGANIZATION] and this region, [ORGANIZATION] has been one of the showcases around the country and internationally of how you build light rail. I think this is the next new model of how you build light rail with affordable housing at the same time.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"So I'm very concerned that if we have too much...  only focus on affordable housing, we end up making that less livable because we don't have the services that go with it or the jobs that go with businesses. So if I can just take [TIME] to talk to you about one of the pilot projects is with [ORGANIZATION]. And they have a program that they're actively working on in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Improved transportation service is only effective if the benefits are not offset by rising housing costs. That's why it's so important that we have developed the equitable housing strategy and why we need to make sure that we deliver on it. Before adopting the locally preferred alternative, we need to be certain that the affordable housing is guaranteed as part of this project.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"As [ORGANIZATION] Commissioner, I've directed [PERSON] to complete assigned [ORGANIZATION] with ORG2 ahead of [ORGANIZATION] vote that commits the parties to the acquisition and development of property expressly for affordable housing along the proposed FAC0  light rail line and again that is from Commissioner you [PERSON]. All right Thank you for our jurisdictional partners for coming DATE2. I really appreciate you",portland
10_04_2018,housing crisis,"Under [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] expresses our cautious optimism and support for the proposed [LOCATION], and I'll talk to you about it. little bit of our hesitancy as we why that is the strategy is well researched and designed to address the near-term housing crisis and the long-term housing needs in the corridor in terms of prevention of displacement and gentrification of low-income and  people of color.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"to make that funding, to make an ongoing [ORGANIZATION] investment above the current levels into the anti-displacement services, make a one-time multimillion-dollar investment into the general funds of an apartment building acquisition fund. These are all things that are in the plan. um, for my [ORGANIZATION] with a strong, with strong guardrails against funds being used for anything other than affordable housing until the housing strategy has been fully implemented and the targets met, and follow through on developing proposals and funding for new tenant protections.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Their job [ORGANIZATION] is to capitalize the early investments that are made now to keep the affordable housing in the affordable housing portfolio. And so it's not only what you're going to do early on, but are we going to long-term make those investments that hold that portfolio together? And so...",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And the other significant thing is [ORGANIZATION], and you heard [ORGANIZATION] say it, they're leaning in around affordable housing. That's significant. I mean, [ORGANIZATION] has one goal, build a train, get people on it, let's get going.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And they get it. They're saying, hey, we need affordable housing to be a successful agency. And so you have partners...  It's not just the city of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And so I guess I can't promise to you that, yes, I will do what [ORGANIZATION] suggested, because it's always going to be what's available and what's the most crucial [STREET] to invest it. And also, I do think we need to invest in this, because unlike the orange line that I was on the council for, where we knew this was coming, and we didn't do what's called for here, and lo and behold, we again have displacements and lack of affordable housing. So let's learn from that.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"Some of that naturally occurring affordable housing along the,  the [ORGANIZATION] corridor, if you travel it very often like I have for [ORGANIZATION], you'll know that they're some of the biggest contributors to some of the stormwater problems we have along there. Some of the maintenance that hasn't been done on those buildings has been on their storm drainage systems, and it contributes to the problems we're dealing with in that area. Thank you.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And I hope to be on this council for a long time and long enough so that we can celebrate some wins of doing things differently and really getting this transportation and affordable housing nexus right. Because as was earlier noted, the principal cost that households are now incurring is a rent plus transportation cost. And...  I'm encouraged by the work that's been done, and I look forward to future presentations.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"I know a lot of effort went into bringing this forward together, and I look forward to seeing the final agreement between the city and [ORGANIZATION]. While [ORGANIZATION] and our partners work very diligently to prevent displacement, together we make sure that we're building the affordable housing and the commercial space to help [ORGANIZATION]ers thrive. And last but not least, I just want to say that this is a very important initiative because it intentionally brings the transportation and the workforce and affordable housing piece together.",portland
10_04_2018,affordable housing,"And as Commissioner [PERSON] noted, there are also issues on the [ORGANIZATION] ballot that can help further this process. And I would encourage people as they look at their ballots to do so very carefully with the intention of supporting any measure that could help us move forward with this affordable housing, frankly, obligation. So thank you all.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"So my point [TIME] is, look, we screwed up the [ORGANIZATION] plan because it wasn't working. And you constantly, constantly say,  rely on affordable housing that has nothing to do with people on the [STREET]. Let me say that again.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"I'm a retired civil servant, so I can do that. People are hanging by their fingertips. And would you please understand that affordable housing is not low-income housing.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"It means that...  There's a percentage of your rates, 25% the federal government talks about, about your mortgage or your rent. That's what you should be paying. That's affordable housing.",portland
10_14_2015,houseless,"Item [DATE], please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding Right to Dream 2, houseless issues. Good morning.",portland
10_14_2015,homeless,"Hello and good morning, everyone. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I've been homeless now for [ORGANIZATION] and I'm originally from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], but I've also lived in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON].",portland
10_14_2015,homeless,"I'm here to be a homeless advocate and talk about how I feel about the sweeps, which, as you all should know, is criminal. [ORGANIZATION] made sure to sweep everyone on that whole block during [LOCATION], where [LOCATION] was going on, right before it let people in. Why?",portland
10_14_2015,homeless,"So [PERSON] and the FAC0  people and the other people and others and yeah, could make money. DATE0 in [TIME], I see [ORGANIZATION] concerned waking up the homeless people and bothering them and just to clear the streets. I feel that if people, if anybody, if people are hungry and naked and sad,  and, you know, poor and homeless, we should help them and not hurt them.",portland
10_14_2015,houseless,"Thanks very much. Okay, let's take [DATE], please. A request of [ORGANIZATION] to address [ORGANIZATION] regarding houseless issues.",portland
10_14_2015,homeless; houseless,"There's a couple of issues that, you know, basically the federal government has weighed in on as far as, you know, how houseless people are criminalized. One was the house or the...  [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has asked for municipalities to, if they want to continue their continuum of care money that they're getting from the federal government, that they would have to explain to the federal government how they planned to deal with the criminalization of homeless people. PERSON0, my question to you is, how would you answer that question?",portland
10_14_2015,homeless,"In the case, I think it was [ORGANIZATION] versus the city of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], where I believe a bunch of homeless people brought suit to the city and it went to [ORGANIZATION] or some higher [STREET]. They have this letter of interest is by no means binding for any municipality, but what it does do is it makes clearer the framework where this can be challenged in a higher [STREET] for the criminalization of homeless people. In closing, I would like to also cite one other thing, and I can't remember right off the top of my head what the [STREET] case was that [ORGANIZATION] issued.  used in framing their letter of interest.",portland
10_14_2015,homeless; affordable housing; houseless,"It was a [STREET] case that I believe it was in [ORGANIZATION] that the question was raised, how do you criminalize the behavior and not criminalize status? And what I mean by that is if a homeless person is breaking the law, how can you not criminalize the status of,  of breaking that law, where another person that's not housed or that has a house could break the same law and not be criminalized on their status. And I'd like you guys to ponder that question a little bit because I do believe that criminalizing the houseless community is not only the wrong thing to do,  It's the most expensive thing we're doing, that where if you can save that money from the criminalization and putting them in housing, we could, you know, maybe come up with another funding source for affordable housing.",portland
10_14_2015,homeless,"We don't have a pure answer for you, and I don't have an answer for you DATE0 about what we're going to do with people who are homeless, who are ready to be discharged and have nowhere else to go. But one of the – we have over 20 work groups who are really working at various and sundry aspects of [ORGANIZATION] is how we're developing it and how we're going to be setting it up. One of those 20 work groups is a transitions work group.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,I don't want Senator [PERSON] to break out in hives. We're not talking about general fund resources. We're talking about the equivalent in this discussion of the residual reserves that we tapped in our preservation agenda where there was an abundance of funds in a reserve that [ORGANIZATION] controlled.  that we liberated to do affordable housing.,portland
10_14_2015,homeless,"And in exchange, we have to provide them with a copy of our [ORGANIZATION] work plan and commit to do the work in the plan, which is aligned with our strategic plan. And what's the federal bucket that it's coming from? It comes, it's a pass-through grant from [ORGANIZATION]  so is that likely to continue at infinitum we hope that that's the case but of of course it's dependent on the federal budget sequestration it's homeless if it's homeland security then it probably will thank you okay any other questions for [ORGANIZATION] thank you very much anyone want to speak on this item if not it's an emergency ordinance take a vote please thank you [ORGANIZATION]",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,[DATE]. Amend Affordable Housing Preservation Code to add [ORGANIZATION] renter protections. Further discussion before we vote?,portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"And I know we've all heard, we heard in this chamber from people that are,  so passionately fearful about their situation in our city, whether they're trying to buy a house and they're seeing the houses on the block transformed or demolished and replaced, a subject that we'll get to here shortly, whether they're trying to stay in their rental unit and are fearful of a letter in the mailbox that says their rent's going up 40%, as we heard in at least some cases has happened. So we have to try some new things, and this is a new thing for [ORGANIZATION] to do. It's appropriate that in a state of emergency we try some things, and then we evaluate, as you just said, [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION], because the [ORGANIZATION] term of this state of emergency seems about right if we're going to focus a lot of attention on,  If you've been in this chamber during these discussions, you'll have heard [PERSON] how your housing bureau is issuing the largest ever notice of funds availability for the construction of affordable housing.",portland
10_14_2015,homeless,"Yes. DATE0 during the homeless [STREET] count,  We found that the representation of African Americans in the unsheltered adult population had grown by 48 percent in [LOCATION]. In order to address the racial disparities in the system, we needed to focus on reaching community members in crisis in places they already frequented.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"My hope is that the effect of this tax will be, if it's adopted by the council in some form after [ORGANIZATION]'s hearing and more discussion and further refinement, My hope is that this will cut the rate of demolition of serviceable houses in half and produce a couple million dollars a year for affordable housing for our fellow citizens who'd like to be able to buy one. That's the goal, at least my goal, and it's open to discussion because this is an innovation about whether this particular tool is a good idea at all, whether we've got it right in its current draft, or whether some different approach would get to that result.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"One of them is for affordable housing. There are, there's a directive within the code that would require [ORGANIZATION] to set up some guidelines following the pattern that's already established in Chapter 30 regarding exemptions for system development charges. And also, the other rebate is for increased density, and [ORGANIZATION] would develop some guidelines about what that looks like, but typically it's an increase in the number of dwelling units on a particular parcel.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"With that, I'll turn it back to [ORGANIZATION]. On the definition page, so just to be clear, the affordable housing rebate that you're proposing just tracks the [ORGANIZATION] exemption program, same criteria? Guidelines based on that program, yes.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,We would look to housing as having that expertise. But it's the same formula that we use for [ORGANIZATION] exemption for affordable housing? Yes.,portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"So we can't exempt them from the tax, but we can rebate them. So the affordable housing provider would have to put up the $25,000 and get it back later? That's correct.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"You know, with this PITS affordability and resources for affordable housing programs against accommodating increased growth that we know is coming, this tries to strike a balance. That's a policy choice for the council to take, whether we want this to apply to only 36 percent of demolitions or if the primary purpose is to raise money for affordable housing, whether we want it to apply elsewhere. Correct.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"I want public testimony on that as well as on the rest of the matter. Mayor, I have a correction to a statement I made earlier. Commissioner [PERSON], you asked about affordable housing and how the tax would apply to that.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"Actually, the financial hardship would only apply if they were appealing a penalty assessment. So at this point, the ordinance would require anyone putting up affordable housing to pay the tax up front and then request the rebate after the fact. I just want to get clear on that.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"In addition, the damage done to neighborhood fabric and the impacts on people living adjacent to these demolitions and construction projects, demolitions have destroyed many viable, affordable homes and apartments in [ORGANIZATION] at a time when affordable housing is becoming increasingly hard to find. The money collected from this proposed demolition tax would go into a fund to address affordable housing issue. We believe it's only fair that the beneficiaries of the boom, the developers, should help pay for some of the negative externalities of their actions.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"Although [ORGANIZATION] agrees that a demolition tax could help curb demolitions and raise money for affordable housing, we do not believe the proposed tax structure we're talking about [ORGANIZATION] will achieve that goal. The next speakers will tell you why we don't believe the proposed tax will work and what we submit as a revised tax for you to consider. Thank you for listening to us.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"We respectfully submit a revised version that [ORGANIZATION] handed out. It's already in code language.

10_14_2015,homeless,"Two-thirds of all of the FAC0 are now not licensed, and therefore we have an enormous housing stock pretty much taken out of the normal use. And that would be an excellent [STREET] for a voucher system for the homeless [ORGANIZATION]. May I ask a question?",portland

10_14_2015,affordable housing,"I don't see it as a – I think the revenue production will be the revenue savings that people will have because there's – and I like to use a term [ORGANIZATION] taught me this term, affordability as opposed to affordable housing. So we need to make affordability part of our language. Okay.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"The four partial rebates that I'd like the council to consider [ORGANIZATION] would be rebates for full deconstruction. And in doing full deconstruction, we would solve for the hazardous materials concerns that neighbors have. Two, a rebate for affordable housing.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"Affordable housing could be one. And for those projects that are on transit corridors or in multifamily zones, you could accommodate some of the concerns about density through having that type of rebate. Can I just ask you why?",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"While I think we can all agree that [ORGANIZATION], like most [ORGANIZATION] cities and really a lot of different areas throughout the country, has an affordable housing issue, I believe the proposed demolition tax is a solution that is looking for a problem. and it doesn't necessarily address affordability here in [ORGANIZATION] at all. Let me kind of share with you some numbers as to why I believe this.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you. I to I'm [ORGANIZATION] executive director of [ORGANIZATION] and And I, too, applaud really all of your efforts [ORGANIZATION] toward creating more opportunities for affordable housing and the production of affordable housing.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"If the issue is demolitions, that's just going to promote it. We would welcome the idea if you were going to exempt the two-for-one that that only occur if it's for affordable housing. We really liked the idea in the original plan of the instead of the flat fee was it the older the house, the more you paid because that's an incentive for preservation.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"Now, since that letter to the editor appeared in the [ORGANIZATION], there's this idea of rebates came up.  and property owners could collect rebates for building multiple units or affordable housing and various other categories. Unfortunately, the rebate would be granted to a developer who is going to replace a one structure and replace with two larger, more expensive [ORGANIZATION]. Thus, no disincentive for the current destruction there be.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"so we need to be focusing on possibly more the urban growth boundary number one to get more land so these developers aren't scrambling and trying to do more projects on very limited property or again talking affordable housing which i mentioned to commissioner [ORGANIZATION]  Let's start talking about an affordable housing bond again, such as they did in [ORGANIZATION] with Mayor [PERSON]. And let's start doing things that are a little bit more productive instead of trying to stall the developers from building more housing when we know we have a housing shortage. And if you want to buy the house before they get to it, we'll buy it.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"And we are pleased to see this policy coming before you for your consideration. And we've supported this concept from the beginning. We appreciate your work, Mayor, and your staff's work to look for new tools to help fund affordable housing and to mitigate the affordability crisis in our community.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"and it is only one step in addressing the problem of demolitions also. So let this not be the end of your work on demolitions, and let this just be the beginning of your work on new affordable housing funding tools, because we have much further to go. Thank you.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"I would agree more with you on our [DATE] is a more realistic number to [DATE],000 to curb demolition. It may not be the ultimate number, but it's a good start. I also feel that getting rebates for a two-to-one demolitions and rebuilding will probably only  add fuel to the fire of demolitions in [ORGANIZATION], and we'll be losing even more of our affordable housing.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"However you want to define affordable housing, I think we'd have to admit that the house that goes down is more affordable than the one that's one or two that get rebuilt. I also want to say just quickly that I've heard comment here about we should be tearing houses down and replacing them with more energy-efficient housing because it's better for the environment. But actually, that is really a very pennywise and pound-for-[PERSON] thing to do with the environment.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"I would like to address the two issues that you're trying to deal with. One is the preservation of the neighborhood character, and the other is the increase in affordable housing. I oppose this tax because I don't think it does either.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"If you have enough money to tear a house down, the extra $25,000 is not going to be a main issue. And if it's increased, you're not going to get any money for affordable housing because you won't collect any. There's other unintended consequences.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,So there's a positive [STREET] of getting more affordable housing without affecting the architectural character of the neighborhood. So thank you. Thank you.,portland

And some of those things will be things that other cities have tried. and we can borrow good ideas from them, and I'm looking forward to the discussion of housing and homelessness with my colleagues, the large city [ORGANIZATION] mayors, when they meet here in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"So then rich people who are buying up houses here would be contributed to affordable housing. Unfortunately, we can't do that because the voters of the state passed a prohibition on real estate transfer taxes. But that's really what I would like.",portland
10_14_2015,affordable housing,"So to that extent, we may be able to provide some assistance for affordable housing without raising house prices significantly. as a whole, if you're putting those $25,000 or $35,000 on a home that's $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, then you probably are going to be raising the price of that home. I appreciated the developer who said that they are going to pass on the cost either to the seller or to the buyer.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"So you do a good job. Thank you. But...  I actually gave everybody a handout, too, for an alternative for homeless people.",portland
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"Yes, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I represent [ORGANIZATION] Watchdog PDX. pertaining to the affordable housing bond measure [DATE] like i say my position is a yes vote on that one of the concerns i will state is that when the discussions on the bond number one when certain properties currently out there are being purchased i would like the since there will be no debt on these properties i would like the property taxes still to be paid  Now, the reason why I say that, let's just say, use [ORGANIZATION] as an example.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"What's the community going to do in terms of...  fundraising and support for people that have been made homeless, for people that have lost their jobs, and for small businesses that are struggling to get going again. So I think there's a lot of questions about the near term, [ORGANIZATION], say, and then there's [LOCATION] or two, while there's going to be a lot of construction and reconstruction in a very walkable pedestrian district that's going to be difficult to manage as well. So just a quick update.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"And that's why every time you get someone off the [STREET], somebody else bounces on the [STREET]. So you have to deal with the $15,000 figure, not the $4,000, not the $2,000, not some idiot that goes out there and says, One, two, three, four. Oh, you don't look homeless.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"I've actually – I was homeless [ORGANIZATION], and I've actually done –  feeding at [ORGANIZATION], you know, and I've done those sort of things.

11_02_2016,homeless; homelessness,"There are always serious problems with using this site as the site of a long-term [INSTITUTION] or campus, the primary one that we just discussed, which is that it is zoned industrial. I voted to allow the private parties interested in using this as a shelter space to see if they could pull together a viable proposal to shelter folks [ORGANIZATION], partly because we need additional shelter space and [LOCATION] is upon us, but also because  I was very impressed that these private parties were stepping forward and saying they were willing to devote private resources to help us deal with the community issue of homelessness. I recently went with the mayor-elect to [ORGANIZATION] to see their [ORGANIZATION] model.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"And I've been very impressed over [ORGANIZATION] to see the [ORGANIZATION] family step forward and offer their property to be used as a temporary [INSTITUTION], to see [PERSON] do exactly the same thing in [LOCATION].

11_02_2016,homelessness,"So thank you for doing that. I need to correct the record because we just got yelled at for doing nothing whatsoever on housing and homelessness. And, Mayor, I hope in your comments you'll correct.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"recap for the past four budgets, how much we have allocated to those services. I want to remind us all, we all unanimously adopted the [ORGANIZATION] plan.

So thank you all. I know that we all care about this, despite being yelled at for not caring.",portland
11_02_2016,housing crisis,"But while we had a disagreement about a piece of dirt, we never had a disagreement about our collective respect and gratitude for the fact that a private developer stepped forward and said, how can I help? And I'm going to join with all my colleagues in saying that while in taking this action, we are going back to a decision that was made [ORGANIZATION],  We should not miss an opportunity to applaud [ORGANIZATION] and his partners for offering to help, and we should encourage this mayor and the next mayor to bring them into the broader conversation about how we can address this housing crisis. They have a lot to bring to the table beyond simply private resources, and we should be grateful for their willingness to do so.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"We had an honest disagreement about [ORGANIZATION], but we never let it get in the [STREET] of our shared commitment to addressing this housing and homeless crisis. So DATE0 I'm pleased to vote aye. PERSON0?",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"Aye. Well, I want to thank [ORGANIZATION] and his partners in the [ORGANIZATION] model, or [PERSON] as they were calling it here, for thinking big. You know, for thinking sort of [ORGANIZATION]-sized big about addressing the tremendous needs we have for shelter and services for people who are homeless in our city.",portland
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"And I think that...  I think we all recognize that we need the private sector. We need to marshal the forces of the private sector if we're ever going to really, truly provide not only enough affordable housing that we need, but also enough shelter space. And I think one of the beauties of [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION] is the co-location of all the different service providers.",portland
11_02_2016,homelessness,"So be it. It is important, as Commissioner [PERSON] noted, to remember the larger context of what we're doing here, which is we declared a state of housing emergency. We have put more general fund dollars into housing and homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] than in [LOCATION] combined before that.",portland
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"We've also changed our percentage of urban renewal funds dedicated to affordable housing.  to yield another $200-plus million of investment in affordable housing. And, again, thanks to your leadership, [ORGANIZATION], I believe the largest bond measure in the history of the city, not just the largest bond measure for housing, or I think it's the largest bond measure for anything, is on the ballot [ORGANIZATION], and I hope and expect that [ORGANIZATION] are going to think  about our future and approve that bond measure. I certainly voted for it, and I think everybody here did as well.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"So we are making a huge investment as partners in this [ORGANIZATION] consortium, and we're going to meet or exceed our goal of opening 650 more shelter beds [ORGANIZATION] in a city that hadn't opened any new shelter beds in a very long time because we're going to open another 150 in [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. So, the progress that we're making is substantial. Some people allege that there are more homeless people in [PERSON] than there used to be.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"We'll find out in [ORGANIZATION] when the count is conducted. It may be the case that there are less places where they're inconspicuous and a city that is welcoming 1,000 more people a month and where the forgotten corners are growing new buildings. So it may not be numerically that we have more homeless people, but we are far from solving the problem.",portland
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"No question about that. And what we're doing in terms of building more shelter beds, building more affordable housing, partnering with the county, partnering with [ORGANIZATION] and other public and private organizations, those are all the right ingredients. And every time I talk to another major city mayor,  They send somebody here to learn from us.",portland
11_02_2016,homelessness,"It is a better idea. And, in fact, that's exactly the program at FAC0, and that's going to be the program at [ORGANIZATION] as well, where we have services there to help people out of homelessness. DATE0, I was celebrating with ORG1 in ORG2 an amazing gift from [ORGANIZATION] foundation of $300,[ADDRESS] are going to move from building beautiful furniture to building tiny homes.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"We currently have an item in our code that allows a religious institution to host one transitional housing unit for [ORGANIZATION], but  What we found is, and I think the original intent of this was either to host a homeless family or potentially host a refugee family or somebody who has recently moved to the area. What many of our providers have found is that [PERSON] is often not enough time to find secure housing for that group. There was also a desire with some institutions to expand the number of households they could host.",portland
11_02_2016,affordable housing,The [ORGANIZATION] city council resolution never actually changed the code. One thing that [ORGANIZATION] did not do was they did look at a staff proposal to reduce the type of review for affordable housing projects that met certain housing bureau conditions. There's currently a temporary ordinance that was instituted in [LOCATION] to allow those to go through a type 2X review instead of a type 3.,portland
11_02_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"Well, just to add to that quickly, even in [ORGANIZATION], affordable housing projects that did come in tactically when they did their evaluation chose to do a Type 3, so you had a choice, so they weren't sure of the benefits, but they understood the intent. Thank you. So I just wanted to mention, you know, the [ORGANIZATION] recognized that these code changes were not the silver bullet to solve homelessness.",portland
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"There are actually a lot of projects that the city is undergoing currently that together will definitely help the situation, but this is just one aspect of it. There are, of course, other... [ORGANIZATION], which you'll be hearing in the future, is another example of finding ways to deal with affordable housing.",portland
11_02_2016,affordable housing,"And then, of course, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] is also looking at provisions related to affordable housing. So this is not, of course, the only bite at the apple.

11_02_2016,homelessness,"It is our hope that this unprecedented awareness can translate into unprecedented engagement in addressing the problems our city faces. Making changes like this one, like the ones before you, we believe that limit barriers to solutions-focused engagement are incredibly important, and we hope will facilitate involvement of additional, perhaps less-resourced, private nonprofit and faith-based groups. And I'm encouraged by the additional conversation that's happened here [ORGANIZATION], that there's opening to continue to look at ways that we can, as jurisdictions and public agencies, be welcoming partners for folks who are looking to be engaged in our efforts to end homelessness.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"Now, another issue on the 200 units, I think that's within reason. Again, some of these shelters I don't think can really operate over 100 efficiently.

11_02_2016,homeless,"I really have questions about that because homeless people, when they're sleeping on sidewalks, are exposed to carbon dioxide fumes, monoxide fumes. Rain is toxic to a homeless person and invokes pneumonia. If you're sleeping on the grass in a park, they could have just put down pesticides.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"Also, I always thought, too, at FAC0, they might have actually paid some of the people to help to clean up the toxic stuff under the concrete, and they might have learned something. So there could be ways to teach homeless people as an apprenticeship program how to clean up a toxic building as a job skill. But I'm just saying in the future, because of the exposure to chemicals,  You said you use a – there's what I call a non-background argument.",portland
11_02_2016,homeless,"So if we have a 20,000-square-foot building that houses no homeless people [ORGANIZATION], but we're not expanding its building area, this doesn't come to bear? Well, it would have to already be a mass shelter. So this applies to existing mass shelters.",portland

10_07_2015,affordable housing,"[TIME]. Mayor [PERSON], commissioners, my name is PERSON1 with [PERSON]. And so the proposal that [PERSON] submitted is improving access to affordable housing.",portland
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"And so to kind of set the context for that, one issue we've known for a while that we needed to work on and there was an area for improvement is the ability for rental households to find out exactly what rental units were supported by [ORGANIZATION] through direct financing or one of our regulatory programs,  well as the application process to actually get into those units so as it currently stands the city takes a fairly passive role in the actual application and rental of the unit there are a number of partner property management companies that advertise vacancies in the units and that facilitate the application process  for a renter household that can create difficulties because the regulated units are managed by a host of partner organizations. And so these households have to go to many different websites or organizations to find out not only about the regulated units, their cost and their availability, but to actually submit an application, pay an application fee, and this happens multiple times. And so with the expansion, so looking forward as the city and you all as the city council have moved forward on increasing the tax exemption for rental units through the city's multi-program, as the city increasingly looks at getting affordable housing units through density bonuses in the central city, as well as the mixed-use zoning outside the central city, we anticipate an increase in the number of property management firms,  joining the regulated affordable housing industry.",portland
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"That's a good thing. We need a greater supply of affordable housing, but that can have a potential  potentially negative impact on the renter households trying to access housing. As you increase the number of companies managing units, you increase the number of companies that individuals need to call or visit websites or visit offices to get information.",portland
10_07_2015,affordable housing,"And so this proposal is to develop a web application that will not only identify all of the city's regulated affordable housing units, but actually facilitate the application to those units  by listing when the units are vacant, regardless of what property owner and property management firm is administering those units, and then provide a process on the back end to facilitate a notification of vacancy and an application process. The analogy that I've been using that I think has helped folks understand is [URL], that Government Jobs Act has a conduit between individuals applying for a job in government service and any number of government agencies, the city, the county, the state, and other governments around the region. To the applicant, all they see is one applicant profile they have to create online,  They see a comprehensive list of openings, and then the web application facilitates their application to the job to the city governments, governments in general.",portland

10_07_2015,homeless,"One of the issues I have is Mr. [PERSON] was a very interesting speaker, and one of the things that I got from his speech was that he stated that there could be a concern of overbuilding the housing inventory.  comparing it to the office from [ORGANIZATION]. Now, when he made that statement, I'd like a little more research on exactly where he thinks the balance is to where we don't have 2,000 to 3,000 homeless people out on the streets and where he thinks it would be considered being overbuilt because, in my opinion, we have a housing shortage. In my opinion, at 2% to 3% vacancy rate,  We need more housing units built.",portland

So that's another reason I'm grumpy about the federal government's lack of initiative on this issue. Another point I think is important to make is that in a normal property tax structure, the fact that the value of housing in [ORGANIZATION] is going up, which would mean that we'd have a lot more property tax revenue to spend on things like affordable housing,  Because of Measure 50 passed in [ORGANIZATION], the value of a property can only go up for tax purposes by 3% a year no matter how much it's going up in actuality.",portland

And so our concern is just that we make sure that we're really looking at the freight and the impact to the businesses.

10_06_2016,affordable housing,And this would allow for mixed use projects that could include density bonuses for affordable housing. This would help with avoiding additional displacement of African American residents and businesses. The second piece is asking you to oppose the down zoning of [ORGANIZATION].,portland
10_06_2016,affordable housing,I believe Commissioner [PERSON] alluded to this in his comments earlier. This is a swath of about 27 blocks of [ORGANIZATION] that would be down zoned from the currently allowed 4-1 FAR to 2-1. This would undermine the city's intent to increase the availability of affordable housing and provide equitable access.,portland
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"and i brought to you a proposal that was expensively detailed multi-family housing  We needed a demolition permit, which was not granted by the council, and the conversation [DATE] revolved around two important matters of public policy. One was protection of the historic contributing property there, and the other was the contribution to affordable housing. So with the help of, after that, with the help of [ORGANIZATION], we sat down and worked with [ORGANIZATION], and they are –  they have developed a plan to save that building and to provide 160 units of housing for senior low-income individuals.",portland
10_06_2016,affordable housing,your position in this and and i'm hearing from affordable housing advocates all kinds of people so the question i have is um um timing um assuming the council agree with you what what's what um is northwest housing alternatives under the gun in terms of of the sequencing of of their work on this and development i mean is there is there a is there a time that that  that you and others would prefer we decide this [STREET]? I'm... Let me ask this another [STREET].,portland
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"But that's one part, and the second part is what is the timing issue here? With good luck, that would happen. But we've all been involved in trying to build affordable housing projects.",portland
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"This is an area of [ORGANIZATION] that is proposed to be rezoned from residential to mixed use. In particular, the change includes incentives for developing affordable housing. This can help mitigate the significant displacement that's happened in north and northeast [ORGANIZATION], and it's still happening among historic residents, often lower-income ones of the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood.",portland
10_06_2016,housing crisis,"The neighbors outside my building are also Portlanders. They live in tents, and they sleep on beds of cardboard. We are in a housing crisis.",portland
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"and we obviously have residents who are very concerned about this. We're concerned about this. We think you should be concerned about this, given the importance of affordable housing and the recognition that this is a vital affordable housing resource.",portland
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"In fact, in their own staff report, they quantified that as it would not likely be developed unless the property was redeveloped as a whole. That's different than saying it won't be developed. And secondly, you should be concerned about the idea of proposing something on the anticipation of the redevelopment of an affordable housing resource.",portland
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"So I think that the affordable housing argument is a red herring in this particular case because of the fact that it could never be achieved. So back to the amendment itself, one thing I want to point out is the reason that it's incompatible with, and this is [ORGANIZATION]'s own map, but you'll see that each of these parcels above the green line are the ones that [ORGANIZATION] has recommended changing from 4-1 to 2-1.  Most of them have little black dots in them, you'll see. And those little black dots are historic landmarks.",portland
10_06_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"We're right near the streetcar, we've got bus routes on FAC0, shopping, restaurants, and a walkability score of 95. Clearly we're in a housing crisis and limiting the ability  to potentially build affordable housing at my location is something that I deem, you know, counterproductive. Um, yeah, I currently am surrounded by, uh, some section eight housing on the, uh, [DATE] and FAC1.",portland
10_06_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Now that we have a parking permit system waiting and ready to go, we have a growing housing crisis, and we have [ORGANIZATION] advocating for eliminating parking requirements, this is the time to do that and remove parking requirements for all mixed-use zones projects. We should trade parking requirements for more affordable housing. As a member of ORG1 for the mixed-use zones, I support the CMC 1, 2, and 3 concept, but I'm concerned about the reduced base FARs in those zones.",portland
10_06_2016,affordable housing,"So in some cases, I am affordable housing. I'm able as an individual person to maintain that community and to engage in it. What I'm concerned about is the legislation by headline.",portland
10_06_2016,affordable housing,I think that historic preservation and affordable housing should not be at odds. I think they should work together. They're both important.,portland
10_06_2016,affordable housing,I fully support the affordable housing project that is proposed on the lot across the [STREET] from me that's gotten a lot of media attention. Right. But a development has to comply with applicable zoning requirements and be compatible with the neighborhood.,portland
10_30_2019,homeless,"Preacher, please read the next item. Item 997, request of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], to address council regarding housing and social services. Good morning.",portland
10_30_2019,homeless,"Okay, so Could you state your name for the record please? [PERSON]. So, um, The contractors, the housing contractors advertise online to the general population and what that does is it makes this home forward flyer that goes to shelters and people who are aging disabled, who are marginalized by gender or race It turns this flyer into fraud because the contractors are allowed through a federal loophole to have their own decide who goes into their housing.",portland
10_30_2019,homeless,"So [PERSON], you know, I think this is charlatanism right here because it takes all of us. He takes this, his campaign manager takes this down to the downtown association. They're not... taking us out to the shelters and saying, hey, you homeless people, come and tell us how it is.",portland
10_30_2019,homeless,"No, they have [ORGANIZATION] go up and give a [TIME] opening address, and then they have a pre-selected homeless person, formerly homeless person, who's going to say how wonderful all the contractors are who are going to present [ORGANIZATION]. Who is the who you're talking about? So that's a finish, and then we can ask questions.",portland
10_30_2019,homeless,"And in the case of safe, no access to laundry or entire bathrooms with disabled access shut down. And the staff have come in with no infectious disease training or CPR training and sometimes they're actually homeless people who have been living in their cars or former heroin addicts or former alcoholics or you know who who are being hired as staff member for disabled people so that leaves a lot of people going out to sleep on the streets because in the shelters there's rampant theft there's bullying on the part of staff and residents and what happened to a guy [TIME] was there's an epidemic of of people stealing stuff while they're sleeping, even though [ORGANIZATION] says it's okay for them to sleep there. And I think that the neighborhood associations have organized an outlaw vigilante thing.",portland
10_30_2019,homelessness,"Yeah, when I first started going to the county board meetings where [ORGANIZATION] is, and I've been to some joint office of homelessness meetings. That's the county. And I'm actually referring to [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_30_2019,homelessness,"As you can see on the agenda items, first of all, I guess I should definitely thank... not just the national but especially the local movement called [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] for his testimony, I'd actually thought that there's going to be a huge potential for bridge building. One of the things that [ORGANIZATION] didn't mention is grants that are out there to protect pollinating nature areas and to assure survival for bees, bats, birds that do the essential work of pollination. So I have a feeling we'll be hearing more about that in the future and maybe there's some room for some partnership there as we look at the... the great dearth, the deficit we have in services to help people recover from either homelessness and or addiction.",portland
10_30_2019,affordable housing,"This is cheaper and more environmentally sound. Financial incentives for tiny commercial space along with tiny homes, less square foot, less cost. Space for creativity with nature, encouraging development of green space and permaculture, particularly for right to return as affordable housing policy.",portland
10_30_2019,affordable housing,"Affordable housing and affordable commercial space go hand in hand. Market rate, commercial space is high and the terms often leave the tenant with little to no rights whatsoever. Think of triple net lease terms.",portland
10_30_2019,affordable housing,"Creative space certification. It's important to preserve future use as a resource. Expanding opportunities for rooftop creative spaces, exploring options to incentivize creative space landlords, refine requirements for new live work spaces, establish a creative space definition within the mixed use commercial zone, incorporate creative spaces into the commercial spaces of affordable housing developments, art pod, and investments in retrofits.",portland
10_30_2019,homeless,"DATE0 we have 11 city partnered nonprofits and 10 umbrella organizations and together they represent more than 450 organizations that our employees can donate to through their paychecks. The nice thing about this campaign is they can make a one-time donation or they can spread that donation out over 26 pay periods. The charitable campaign has organizations that span the range of environmental services, help for the homeless, help for veterans, animals.",portland
12_13_2017,homeless; homelessness,"Third, the city and its partners, county and [ORGANIZATION] and others, simply have to do better. No one that I talk to, no one has the least interest in criminalizing homelessness, harassing the homeless, and claiming otherwise really is a distraction from the real issue at hand, which we think is the enabling of a lawless subculture on public property. So the extent there is a tremendous groundswell, obviously, of discontent over the increase in property crime, the health hazards.",portland
12_13_2017,homelessness,"And if you're going to be back [ORGANIZATION] after [ORGANIZATION], let me also tell you what would be helpful for us to hear. because as you know, we are pursuing a comprehensive response around...  homelessness. This administration, along with the county, has never invested more in prevention, rent assistance, emergency shelter, housing strategies, addiction, mental health treatment on that side of the spectrum, nor has there been a more concerted effort in [LOCATION] around what I'm describing as livability issues, enforcing codes, ensuring safety, addressing  uh, uh, public health and public safety concerns, environmental concerns.",portland
12_13_2017,homeless,"So I have goodwill, but there's a lot of serious things going on. My son was killed here by the [ORGANIZATION]. I'm currently homeless.",portland
12_13_2017,homeless,Okay.  spiritual occult behavior and it goes into the homeless scenario as well it I want to mention the Christian institutions like [ORGANIZATION] red ORG1 as well as where I am the [INSTITUTION] light ORG2  run by people hanging skeletons and signs of Satan from their ceiling in their offices? Why is that? And they're supposed to be Christian.,portland
12_13_2017,homelessness,"So what I'd like to say is this homelessness situation. I'd like to be a part of that. As far as [ORGANIZATION] is concerned, again, I'm not saying war against them.",portland
12_13_2017,homeless,"And so what I will say to you [ORGANIZATION] about these two gentlemen that have done such an amazing body of work that has shaped the fabric of our city, whether it is police reform, social justice, housing, feeding the homeless, clothing. Finding people jobs. You know the foundation of the African American church has been the [STREET] where we go, where we have not had, we've had our rights denied.",portland
12_13_2017,affordable housing,"It's more important than ever that [ORGANIZATION] defend and advance its interests. As we've seen from the [PERSON]ional Tax Plan and recent [ORGANIZATION] announcements regarding the prioritization of Superfund sites,  [PERSON] and the current presidential administration are pivotal in our ability to address community priorities like investing in affordable housing and moving forward with the [ORGANIZATION] cleanup. The administration and the leadership in [PERSON] have made it clear.",portland
12_13_2017,affordable housing,"with this tax bill that their priorities are not supporting working middle-class Americans. Additionally, it's clear that local government is going to need to further step up as the federal government retreats from addressing issues like affordable housing and mental health services at the community level. Lastly, as the [ORGANIZATION] has issued a list prioritizing the [ORGANIZATION] site, we'll be working closely with other interested parties to make sure that this process does indeed move forward.",portland
12_13_2017,homeless; affordable housing,"Once again, the top priority is affordable housing, homeless assistance, mental health and support services all kind of packaged in one big omnibus priority. You also have response to the opioid crisis, immigration, investment in urban infrastructure, the Urban Area Security Initiative, which is also known as [ORGANIZATION]. And then tax reform and FAC0 cleanup were two new additions to the priority list from the [ORGANIZATION] agenda because we used that as a baseline.",portland
12_13_2017,affordable housing,"And our focus was primarily on the potential devastating impact on affordable housing development with the loss of private activity bonds and low-income housing tax credits. I don't think I have additional comments on the federal side, so I'll just say aye. I appreciate your ongoing connection of us with our federal delegation when they visit back in [ORGANIZATION] during the sessions and over the course of time too.",portland

If approved, those dollars be used to recycle derelict RVs with little or no salvage value that are cost prohibitive for owners to recycle. As a result, these RVs are often sold or auctioned for very minimal amounts and repeatedly cycle through the tow yards and back onto the streets of [ORGANIZATION].",portland

And while we are making strides and we have a joint office with the county working on homelessness, we know that the de facto policy of this city is for 1,000-plus people to lay on our sidewalks and lay under our bridges with almost nothing, sometimes a tarp. They can't get that from any city agency if they don't have a tarp or a blanket.",portland
10_26_2016,homeless; homelessness,"We know that [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have considered policies based on the [ORGANIZATION] disclosure, and Republican Congressman [PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION] actually authored an amendment designed to prevent ORG1 from subsidizing a GPE3 company that has CEO pay more than 100 times that of its medium worker pay. and [ORGANIZATION] staff from a member of ORG2 which is [ORGANIZATION] called my office to inquire about the surtax proposal before us DATE1 together we can make a difference on this issue before asking mr PERSON1 to come up and explain the mechanics i do have an amendment to propose the ordinance before you has a statement that is somewhat out of date  It says, now, therefore, the council directs item B, the city budget office will increase the ongoing current appropriation level target for ORG3 by $2.5 million starting DATE2, to support the joint office of homeless services efforts to help people move off the [STREET], out of shelters, and back into permanent housing, as well as services that help people avoid homelessness. Thank you.",portland
10_26_2016,homeless,"When I proposed this surtax, there was a $3.5 million gap between the commitment we had made to funding homeless services in [ORGANIZATION] and the amount that we spent in ongoing funds [PERSON] on homeless services. And I proposed that the approximately $2.5 million that we expect this surtax to raise would help to close that gap. In the meantime, in the context of the fall bump, we actually have already raised the [ORGANIZATION] target for [ORGANIZATION] by $3.5 million.",portland
10_26_2016,homeless,"And I know, speaking as the commissioner in charge of [ORGANIZATION], that that bureau could not tolerate a [ADDRESS] about their bureaus. So, although given what we did in the bump on homeless services, the funding funds in this proposal is no longer targeted to a specific service, raising this additional revenue will help us bridge the gap between our revenue and our demands in [ORGANIZATION] so that we will not have to make cuts in critical services.",portland
10_26_2016,homeless,"I would ask you to do one thing, though, and that's to focus this new revenue on those folks who need it most, the jobless, the homeless, those disabled. We stand in support of this measure. Thank you very much.",portland

09_26_2018,homeless,"It was a very controversial decision, as you're well aware, and I agree with you on the staffing. I was just down in [ORGANIZATION] talking to the mayor there, talking about homeless issues, talking about livability issues, which loom large in [ORGANIZATION] as well as here in [PERSON] and up in GPE2 with Mayor [PERSON].

09_26_2018,homeless,"When I was homeless, every feeding center shut down except in [ORGANIZATION].

09_26_2018,homeless,"I don't think you should sell it. I think you should give it to the library, give it to this new shelter, the [ORGANIZATION] shelter, so that homeless people can have access to the Internet or whatever, if it's capable of doing that.

09_30_2020,homeless,i i appreciate it and and just a quick footnote here um i have been meeting with different business district associations chambers [ORGANIZATION] i actually visited a number of small business owners and i'm absolutely hearing  the concerns that are being expressed around public safety and around livability.

09_30_2020,affordable housing,"Just to go through a couple of things about [ORGANIZATION]. So again, starting in [ORGANIZATION], any building adding 20 or more units is required to contribute to the city's affordable housing inventory through [ORGANIZATION]. Developers must choose from several options in order to fulfill inclusionary housing requirements, providing affordable units in an otherwise market rate building.  sending units to another building, or paying into the inclusionary housing fund.",portland
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"So I want to commend this developer for building units that are more affordable. And really  challenging the widely held belief that it's too expensive to develop affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And yeah, I think I'll leave it at that.",portland
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"And just to kind of add on a couple of comments, you know, this is a, you know, this is a tricky one in front of [ORGANIZATION], so we appreciate the discussion. ORG1 inclusionary housing program doesn't regulate what a developer can build in terms of types of bedrooms or the size of the bedrooms. It simply requires that a portion of those become regulated affordable housing.",portland
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"but if you added to It'd be, you know, 22% where the others are at 18 and 19%. So once again, the larger unit for family friendly affordable housing is the one that gets shortchanged  So just would like us to continue to try to push for larger units for families. And that's a great location for families in terms of access to schools and parks.",portland
09_30_2020,affordable housing,"If our inclusionary housing policy is generating affordable units that are above market rate in  I will support this, but we need to  we need to dig in and figure out how to solve for some of these challenges. The other thing I want to say, it's relevant to the last item, but also to this one, is if we are seeing an overproduction in studios and one bedrooms, and we can't compel developers to offer larger units as their rent-restricted units, then  PERSON0, You know, one of the solutions is we we address our investments accordingly with the with the dollars that we have to build affordable housing and we invest more in those two and three bedroom units.

I came to [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] to take a DATE2 class that helped me get into [ORGANIZATION] As you recall, I'm sure, back then [ORGANIZATION] was unique in the sense that homeless people had the right to congregate in packs of 100 or more on the streets of downtown.",portland
10_28_2015,homeless,"And that's why people do it, safety in numbers. And secondly, it gives a sense of community and this  This can make all the difference between a livable situation and a very bad one. Lastly, it will reduce the shame of being homeless.",portland
10_28_2015,homelessness,"Now, the ability to make connections and the right to congregate is easily the most overlooked aspect of homelessness. Typically, we think of keeping people fed and warm, but it's been my experience that people will find a [STREET] to keep warm or to feed themselves. But what they can't do by themselves is find connection, find that safety in numbers, that ability to congregate, create community, etc.",portland
10_28_2015,homeless,"Now, underneath that bridge, there was a small group of [STREET] punks off to the side. They had their petty little skirmishes [ORGANIZATION], but they were easily outnumbered by what was a much larger body of peaceful homeless people. And to my eyes, there was a sense of peace, if not community, on the streets of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON].",portland
10_28_2015,homeless,"And this is a recurrent. Volunteers, they'd come down, and you couldn't tell if they were – I couldn't tell if they were coming down to mark down [TIME] or to just hang out for the fun of it. And this is a recurrent theme you'll find if you go from town to town in homeless situations.",portland
10_28_2015,homelessness,"But yet when we speak of homelessness, the only solution we can think of is to break people up rather than drown it with human nature. But I understand that a select few business leaders' lack of trust for human nature and their interests may take precedent over the very lives of people sleeping on a dirty, pissed-on sidewalk. But if we're going to enact policies that are going to affect people in ways that you can't even begin to understand without getting to know them, we should at least have alternatives in [STREET].",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Almost done. On that note, and alternatives are not missions that institutionalize and disrespect people. We need, on that note, hopefully [ORGANIZATION] I'll be able to testify and share an idea on affordable housing that could kill two or three birds with one stone and maybe make everybody happy.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"So it is that balance. But, again, I don't want to leave the impression that because our members of the police force don't live in the city of [ORGANIZATION], they're not committed to serve the citizens of [ORGANIZATION].

The decisions we make [ORGANIZATION] will help ensure that these new funding streams will add and continually add thousands of new affordable units to the city.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"And as everyone in this room knows, [ORGANIZATION] spent a life  fighting for affordable housing in our community, and you could say that she actually built the foundation of this movement. And on [ORGANIZATION], she came before us when we were debating whether to increase funding for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], and she sat where Director [PERSON] is sitting, and she said two very powerful things. She said, it is important for you as a council to keep your promises, and I challenge you to do more.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"And as a result of her advocacy and the advocacy of a whole host of groups, including [ORGANIZATION] and affordable housing advocates in [ORGANIZATION] on and a whole chorus of voices, the council made a change in policy and significantly increased funding for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And I felt at the time that that was a turning point for this council. because a lot of familiar faces came back into this building sensing that things were happening in our community, and they demanded that the council take action.",portland
10_28_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"I'm very proud to be on a council that has said that affordable housing and homelessness is the top concern facing our city. And as [ORGANIZATION] said, we're not done. And under the leadership of this mayor and this housing commissioner, we've taken some big steps, but we are not done.",portland
10_28_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"And finally, I just want to say that this $67 million is going to be helpful, but as the mayor said...  it's not going to solve the problem [TIME]. And one of the things that I want to work with my colleagues to ensure that as we identify new resources to fight for affordable housing and homelessness, that we target those resources to people with the greatest need. If there ever was a time when we had to target our dollars to people with the greatest need, it is now.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"I would warrant to say that the [ORGANIZATION] will care a great deal about it as well, since they have to market the city as an economic prospect as well. So if there's no further questions on FAC0, I'd like to invite up [ORGANIZATION] Executive Director [PERSON] to join [PERSON] and review the plan for the 45% affordable housing. Slide up another chair there, you guys.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is honored to have worked with the mayor, Commissioner [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION] to develop this proposal and make such a significant contribution to address the most pressing problem in [ORGANIZATION], the lack of affordable housing for our residents. As a result of this action, 40% of all urban renewal dollars will have been invested in affordable housing over the [ORGANIZATION] life of the set-aside. And I just want to emphasize that's over the life so that we don't get confused by percentages.",portland
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"Thank you. While some may believe that this proposal took too long to come to council for a vote, the [ORGANIZATION] board and our stakeholders asked for thoughtful consideration of both the tradeoffs and priorities and the impact on [ORGANIZATION]'s long-term sustainability. In the end, we believe this proposal represents a careful balancing of the need for immediate action on our housing crisis and maintaining our commitment to the priorities established with the stakeholders and [ORGANIZATION]s in urban renewal areas.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We hope the energy and advocacy for more funding for affordable housing continues after the council action, as we all work toward a permanent long-term source for funding for affordable housing. Even with fewer dollars, [ORGANIZATION] remains committed to the strategic plan adopted by this council DATE0 and hopes to engage council in exploring opportunities to solidify [ORGANIZATION]'s financial future. Now I'd like to turn the presentation over to [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON1.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is status quo at $9.8 million. FAC0 goes from $60 million to $65 million in the aggregate, and [PERSON] goes from $26.5 million  with an increase of $20 million, as I mentioned, with an intertie to the [ORGANIZATION] property, to $46.5 million. So that $66.5 million represents, in total, about a $270 million investment in affordable housing.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"And so it will require us as we come across those opportunities to figure out other funding sources to bring to bear on those projects. But generally speaking, as we go through the other urban renewal areas, again,  these funds were the least programmed. In [ORGANIZATION], we have worked hard to figure out how do we make good on the [ORGANIZATION] action plan and bring forward additional resources to affordable housing.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,This adds $5 million more to the affordable housing pot that was established at that time. And what it's really taking from is the additional resources that we projected could be created from the full build out of the FAC0 property project.  which was in the neighborhood of $25 to $30 million. And there was a range of infrastructure and parks projects that are kind of in that speculative part of our forecast.,portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We discussed increasing the [ORGANIZATION], and we discussed linkage and or inclusionary housing. I understand inclusionary housing is a difficult issue in this state and would require legislative action, so I think you're taking the correct course. by studying linkage, if you will, or charging a per square foot for various developments to generate affordable housing funds.",portland

From the local level to the state level, we are excited to forge partnerships to creatively engage and overcome this crisis and secure a safe, healthy, and just community where everyone has a chance to create a life without constant fear of eviction, calamity, and homelessness. From our first proposal,  the [ORGANIZATION]'s DATE0 meeting through our press conference assembly before your [LOCATION] work session we have insisted that crisis requires swift and significant action although the [ORGANIZATION] increase is a small advance in this crisis taking this first step now is critical for [ORGANIZATION]'s and will be life-changing for the hundreds of vulnerable residents who will find the refuge and springboard that affordable housing provides  We understand that reassignment of funds to affordable housing and urban renewal areas may come at a cost to other budgets, but trade-offs are expected in a meaningful response to emergency and there are other costs we want you to bear in mind  the cost of upheaval and even homelessness on the lives of struggling and vulnerable adults and children who find themselves unexpectedly displaced or dispossessed, such as [ORGANIZATION], a resident of the interstate FAC0, who will share her story [DATE], the long-term public cost to parks, transportation, and public safety.",portland
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"These important programs may experience short-term cuts or delays with respect to funding the housing emergency,  but those will be known costs that can be planned for. The longer we take, though, to meaningfully address the burgeoning housing crisis, the greater the unintended costs to local governments for parks, transportation, and safety, spiraling costs in both budget impacts and lost ground on critical goals. Add to those the public costs of damage control from the well-known difficulties with health, education, and chronic poverty suffered by families without stable housing, and we cannot afford not to pass and exceed this new floor.",portland
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"First of all, I just wanted to express appreciation, appreciation for the responsiveness of this leadership to the housing crisis and that some creative process was put in [STREET] to rapidly and tangibly do something of significance to address it. The [ORGANIZATION] set aside being increased to 45% is tremendous in that it is a 50% increase above the present amount. Of course, I think all of us had hoped it would be a 50% increase, but we're glad for a 45%.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"As the chair of [ORGANIZATION], the foresight and intent to develop [ORGANIZATION] with the purpose of keeping accountability and transparency for the city's efforts around affordable housing is proving to be of great value. our primary focus and concern is to ensure that what has been undertaken is under is accomplished with efficiency effectiveness equity and as promised the promises made become the promises kept to that extent um [ORGANIZATION] created a structure to ensure that the funds utilized in the manner the community states uh  that their needs are, that they're met. I would like to ask the council to consider increasing the scope of the oversight committee with additions to membership representing the [ORGANIZATION] area to be included around these additional funds.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Good [TIME]. You know, as I was looking at the opportunity to testify to you [ORGANIZATION], I reflected back in my life and my career, and I've now worked [LOCATION] in affordable housing and community development in [ORGANIZATION].

10_28_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"We have been challenged with homelessness and affordable housing off and on over [ORGANIZATION] to greater or lesser degrees, but what we're seeing in [LOCATION] or two is really quite stunning. So I also want to applaud the council for the leadership that it is taking to look at this problem in a very comprehensive [STREET] and to look in all corners for the resources that can help contribute to solutions. If we don't solve this, we do risk the health of the overall community.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We hope that [ORGANIZATION] will support that work. And I know you're looking at other resource-based strategies to support affordable housing. We are at a time where we need those, all the tools, all hands on deck and everyone doing their part.",portland
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION], you said that everybody has a role to play, and you said specifically we're going to talk to the private sector to see what role they'll play. And I just want to underscore, in [ORGANIZATION], 11,000 new market rate apartments, less than 2% of which were affordable. And when I hear developers say that the city has not been generous enough with their subsidies, I say to them, what is your moral obligation to address this housing crisis?",portland
10_28_2015,housing crisis,"But we're talking about a moral obligation. And to the comment about the impact on families through this housing crisis, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], with a new dynamic principal doing her level best, 50% of the students that she starts [ORGANIZATION] with will not be there on DATE1 of school. And so you want to ask the question, what does it mean not to have stable home for struggling families?",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Yes, please, Commissioner [PERSON]. Sorry, I forgot that. Colleagues, this doesn't directly relate to the [ORGANIZATION] set-aside percentage technically, but I think as long as we are talking about committing additional [ORGANIZATION] resources to affordable housing, we should take a look at FAC0.",portland

And finally, we are here [ORGANIZATION] because we know that there is a housing crisis that  And unfortunately, we don't have the tools to address it all at once.

The project selection committees are filled with homeowners, property owners, known opponents of affordable housing.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Renters, housing advocates, and communities of color are rarely at the table for these conversations. So I'll finish there, but I just want to mention that low-income Portlanders –  I've heard the word burden used as far as neighborhoods being burdened with affordable housing, etc. And I just want to push back about that.",portland

To many older adults, retirees, and senior citizens, aging in [STREET] means continuing to live in their owner-occupied single-family homes.

10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Seniors on fixed incomes who will see their cost of living rise with no corresponding increase in income have been completely left out of the conversation. Where is the dialogue and the mitigation for the financial impacts on these retirees?  It seems only equitable that if 45% or 50% of urban renewal funding is to be dedicated to affordable housing, seniors on fixed or semi-fixed incomes living in their own homes should have a similar percentage reduction from the urban renewal line on their property tax bills. It is simply unjust to expect low-income seniors to subsidize affordable housing for other people.",portland

We're trying to put things in [STREET], put affordable housing permanently in [STREET] so that when the prices do start going up in [LOCATION], we retain the affordable housing that we have.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"So we're not against affordable housing. But when you look at [ORGANIZATION], very few households there make more than the median family income.

10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We have a lot of affordable housing. What we need is to put money, instead of building more affordable housing, put money into rehabilitating and converting some of the privately owned properties so that they stay affordable housing when and if the other rents begin to rise. So if you're going to put more money into affordable housing and gateway, I'd say...  prefer to see it go into that [STREET], to rehabilitate, make them better, some of the older housing that we have, and keep it so that it stays affordable housing in the future.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"And one other concern of mine is that the work session that I saw, [ORGANIZATION] said that they would put affordable housing on the property adjacent to the new FAC0, which will be built starting in [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION]. Okay. That's not consistent with a master plan that many of us spent a long time developing.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"There are other [ORGANIZATION]-owned properties in [ORGANIZATION]. This is not the [STREET] for affordable housing.

10_28_2015,affordable housing,"We don't have much of anything that generates [ORGANIZATION], and that project was designed to generate [ORGANIZATION] and should stay that [STREET]. Let me just offer a little bit of reassurance here from my perspective, and that is what each district is...  um contributing to this effort varies widely obviously from district to district the proposal is that there'd be an additional two million dollars we don't have a lot in our fund to start understand that so it's sort of from from each according to their ability um but uh also how we how we address the affordable housing need in each district doesn't have to be the same right so it doesn't have to be a generic project i guarantee it won't be which is why i wanted to you know emphasize that what  our need is and gateway and we've heard much the same concern from [ORGANIZATION] that they have a specific action plan they have certain things that they want to see and so our commitment here is that",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"yes we're going to raise the total amount of commitment to affordable housing but how we do it in each district  really needs to be involving people from that district, as you've mentioned. That's critical.",portland

And when she left, one of my friends in the table said, you know, shame on the city for not providing a shelter or a home for her.  and instead spending money on, and he rattled off a number of things, as people often do, that they're sort of acting in denial about the fact we don't have enough resources.",portland
10_28_2015,affordable housing,"Well, I very much appreciate the council's support for increasing the tax increment set aside from 30% to 45% and generating some $63, $64 million of additional investment in affordable housing.

The apartments built on the [PERSON] were constructed in [LOCATION] and DATE2. Many of the [ORGANIZATION] single-family homes have been converted to multiple rental units.",portland
12_03_2015,affordable housing,"But it's also clear that to be successful in this, we cannot back away from our principal urban form policy, providing more intensely developed centers and corridors and strategic areas throughout the city. More density is the only [STREET] to accommodate more affordable housing and transportation choices, though it may take different forms in different neighborhoods, the development of intense mixed-use pedestrian-friendly corridors and centers with good transit service while preserving most of the nearby single-family housing is absolutely essential to the creation of a healthy, vibrant [ORGANIZATION] for all.

And I think the best thing we all can do is familiarize ourselves in advance.

10_02_2019,homeless,"I commend the city of [ORGANIZATION] for adopting [PERSON]'s public safety system by gaining momentum with the new service [ORGANIZATION], a medical and mental public health service. You will be, by default, offer much needed relief to the other two groups of persons on the streets, addicted and homeless. Once you find a solution for addiction crisis, these sufferers will be off the [STREET] and into caring rehabilitation facilities.",portland
10_02_2019,homeless,"We can address the remainder of the homeless by [STREET] of, yes, [ORGANIZATION], the homeless cure. The reason this plan will succeed while others have failed is in part due to its all-inclusive nature. All organizations, public and private, in one [STREET].",portland

Only by separating the groups can we go forward with a revitalization plan for [ORGANIZATION]. Homeless by choice, mental health sufferers, and addicted.",portland
10_02_2019,homelessness,"First, mental health and addiction has been and still is [ORGANIZATION] the main reason why homelessness has not been dealt with and must be dealt with separately. If you ask every person who has ever lost a friend or family member to suicide, their comments are nearly all the same. We wished we would have done something sooner.",portland
10_02_2019,homelessness,"But it also had the effect of displacing all the other issues that we as a council need to hear from the public about. We need to hear about housing and homelessness and transportation and equity and police accountability. Unfortunately, the [STREET] things unfolded [ORGANIZATION] was all about the FAC0 budget cuts.",portland
10_02_2019,homelessness,"And these effects include economic impacts that can trap victims in abusive relationships and can continue long after the physical violence has ended, resulting in loss of jobs and housing. In the most recent point in time count for [ORGANIZATION] of people experiencing homelessness, more than one-third of those who responded to the question said that they had experienced and were fleeing domestic violence. Supporting the victims of domestic violence requires resources, partnerships, and collaborations across jurisdictions and systems, including the city, the county, law enforcement agencies, and nonprofit partners.",portland
10_02_2019,homelessness,"Finally, recently I've been thinking a great deal about how to participate in wider movements for social change and social justice. For Domestic Violence Awareness [DATE], I would encourage you to do the same with a focus on the following three truths. First, domestic violence is the number one driver of homelessness for those who identify as women.",portland

And so I vote aye, and I look forward to working with the chief to make this report better and to have it really reflect what's happening on the ground in our community. PERSON0.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,We thank them. I commend the bureau's work in gathering feedback from our community in order to develop and update this important proposal. The proposals help accelerate the construction of more affordable housing by offering incentives and bonuses so that different housing options are available for more Portlanders at all income levels.,portland

And lastly, to the best of our ability, to manage the risk of displacement from new development and growth by developing proactive strategies to support people staying in their neighborhoods. [ORGANIZATION] does this for multifamily housing, and this is where we will see most of our growth now through [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"I'm not going to get into a whole lot of detail about income issues. I provided a handout that has some more information, but we wanted to give people some sense as to what we mean when we talk about affordable housing or what's affordable to people at various incomes. On the screen, we have a number of income ranges from very low income, up to 30 percent of the area median income.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"We throw around this term affordable housing as if affordable housing is the same for everybody, right? So thank you, thank you, thank you. This is a clear picture that helps me decide what's affordable for me.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"I want to make sure that we're going to have family housing in [ORGANIZATION] as well as affordable housing. I don't think the two should be exclusive. The key thing about the proposals to bear in mind is you would still be able to do these smaller numbers of attached housing development, but we would be opening up allowances so you could do other types as well.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"And the primary [STREET] you get to a bigger scale is providing affordable units. We're increasing... inclusionary housing, bonuses for affordable housing, which is, which provides housing affordable at 60 to 80 percent of area median income, but the greatest bonuses, the biggest priority bonuses are really aiming at that 60 percent of area median income. So these are things that more directly get beyond just what the private sector might do, but but link to ensuring that affordable units are included when you go bigger with development.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"We also have an allowance where if you commit to preserving existing affordable housing, sometimes what people call naturally occurring housing, you could transfer development rights to another site, go bigger elsewhere. So there's a linkage to preserving affordable housing. Another thing that we have is a bonus through which if you're providing accessible units and of course helping to meet the needs of our our aging population, our disabled population, you would get some bonus to help encourage that.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,Most of our permits and our multi-dwelling zones don't require accessibility. So we're looking at some tools that can increase the physical accessibility. But the biggest priority is getting affordable housing in.,portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"Just a little heads up, I'm feeling a little under the weather, so if you hear some sniffles, I apologize. [ORGANIZATION] is pleased to forward our [ORGANIZATION] recommended draft. The [ORGANIZATION] zoning code amendments make fundamental changes to [ORGANIZATION]'s multi-dwelling zones that will help our city meet its future housing needs, including new incentives that prioritize affordable housing.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] works together with [PERSON] as part of a broader housing opportunities initiative to update the zoning code to expand housing options and address housing affordability while developing strategies to minimize displacement. We at ORG2 believe that development in multi-dwelling zones is important for allowing more people to live close to services and transit. And the proposals included, excuse me, and the proposals include appropriate mitigation measures that will help address [ORGANIZATION]'s need for affordable housing.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"These amendments provide new regulatory tools that will help expand our housing options, facilitate the development of affordable housing, foster design in outdoor spaces that support quality living environments for residents, and provide new tools for creating needed [STREET] connections in areas that lack them, such as [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you for the opportunity to participate as part of the review of this project and for considering our recommendations. Thank you, Commissioner.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"This is actually the frame as to why we're doing all the stuff that we're doing. So I think it may be a missed opportunity for those who are here [ORGANIZATION] that we're not setting the context for why are we doing this. Yes, well we certainly through [ORGANIZATION], we are addressing some of the inequities that we're seeing in the city from this history, particularly looking at affordable housing option and providing more opportunities and different additional units and developments in the multifamily zones.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"As affordable housing is a major goal of this plan, it's important that low income residents enjoy the health and heat island reduction benefits trees provide at home, as do [ORGANIZATION]'s wealthier residents, many of whom live in tree rich neighborhoods. We can have both affordable housing and large trees in our city. Please do not approve additional exemptions from tree planting and preservation requirements for affordable housing reasons.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,Title 11 exempts affordable housing projects from the tree preservation and planning standards that most other development projects must meet. These exemptions further exacerbate the inequities associated with tree deficient neighborhoods. This really is an issue of equity.,portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"And so our first point is really that changing terms that are currently maximums in the code to by right or base makes that even less clear for applicants. And so I think what we're asking for is that in historic districts that there be more alerts or or more kind of provisions in the code that actually specifically mention that you have to meet those compatibility standards. Next, that extra FAR, which is the bulk of a building, earned by affordable housing projects, right?",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"I would say that this is not the right incentive to use within historic districts for that very reason, that sometimes it's hard for a project even to meet the maximums, let alone extra that's earned for a project. And so what I would suggest and what [ORGANIZATION] would suggest, that if we have to say no to some incentive extra earned area of bulk that at least that developer could then incentivize it and transfer it out of the district. I don't want to see us in the position of having to say no to a developer of an affordable housing project and leave them with nothing.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"I am representing [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a project manager at [ORGANIZATION] and am a developer of affordable housing. As [ORGANIZATION] explained in his presentation, the multi-dwelling zones are well connected to schools, parks, job centers, commercial centers, and multimodal transit.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"As a result, they are great locations for households of all sizes, all incomes, all phases of life, and And [ORGANIZATION] is a game changer for affordable housing developers. To illustrate the significance of the impacts of [ORGANIZATION], I analyzed the before and after capacity of a five-acre parcel that [ORGANIZATION] owns in northeast [ORGANIZATION]. And five acres is a lot of land.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"Deeply affordable units serve households at or below 60% of area median income. These are units that are largely financed with low-income housing tax credits, and they are the bread and butter of [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing development community. [ORGANIZATION] would be able to increase density on this site by a further 50% to 440 units if we were to redevelop it.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"The shift to an FAR based system allows greater flexibility in the type and number of housing units developed, which will allow for a greater variety of the housing options in these zones while maintaining an appropriate scale. The properties we have studied would be more likely to be developed and would include more housing units, including regulated affordable units if the proposal is adopted. We support the restructured bonuses, which prioritize affordable housing and family-sized units.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"But I'm here representing, it looks like this, I'm here representing [ORGANIZATION], which is a community group embracing change to promote livability and inclusivity, sustainability, and climate projection, and we also support housing affordability. Better housing by design, will increase the number of units that can be built near jobs, transit and shopping, which will result in less driving, less carbon emissions. As reached, [ORGANIZATION] said it will promote affordable housing and better housing across the city.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"We support all the changes proposed, especially the change from unit count to FAR and calculations. This will allow more units and there's also inclusionary zoning and additionally the deep affordability bonus in [LOCATION] that [ORGANIZATION] told you about. We do support FAR transfers to preserve affordable housing and to preserve trees.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"I think that in a historic district, you look at [ORGANIZATION], they build new big buildings right next to [ORGANIZATION] buildings. But as [ORGANIZATION] testimony, the ORG1 strongly opposes opportunity to earn more bulk in these areas, in other words, get more FAR for having affordable housing, even for deeply needed affordable housing. That's their words.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,"that makes parking that you do have to build more expensive. So if we are requiring parking on some lots, even a small amount, but we're making them more expensive, we're kind of at cross purposes to our goals. We want affordable housing and green development.",portland
10_02_2019,affordable housing,Our neighborhood association has worked to make sure that our board members represent our diverse demographics. Half of our neighborhood association boards are renters and half are low income.

09_30_2015,homeless,"And I will say that I signed up to do this ahead of time, so this [ORGANIZATION]'s news and all that's happening may have changed how I wrote this, but I'm going to move forward. I'm concerned about the apparent growing homeless population in our city. I spend a lot of time driving through the industrial east side for my children's various sports practices.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"It's just –  you know, sad. DATE0, Mayor, you suggested that the city declare a state of emergency in regard to the homeless crisis. Before this announcement, I was curious what the city's end game was regarding safe and affordable housing for all in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
09_30_2015,homelessness,"I recognize that homelessness is a multi-pronged problem, or we recognize, involving possible, but not exclusively mental health, as well as physical health issues, possible drug addiction, and lack of employment opportunities. It is hard to imagine addressing those separate issues when folks don't have access to stable housing. With the state of emergency declaration, and then I know we listened to your announcements downstairs.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless,"It seems that shelter beds are only a short-term fix. Rather, radical ideas may be the only [STREET] to influence systematic change in the [STREET] our city reverses the homeless trend. I'm not sure what these ideas might be, but there must be model programs in other cities that have successfully tackled this complex issue.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless,"Great questions, and actually we want to solicit your ideas and also students' ideas because when the council takes up this proposal for declaring an emergency, we're really looking for what tools do people suggest that we use. You've got a city council that's committed to working collaboratively on this issue among ourselves and with the county and with [ORGANIZATION], but we also depend on volunteers a lot, and there are churches and other groups that want to do more in terms of  helping the homeless. So your students' ideas, your ideas over [ORGANIZATION] in particular would be very helpful.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] is our staff person who leads this combined effort between the city and the county, so he's going to have a specific plan and proposal for us. But it's basically...  upping our game by a $30 million increment of how much the city and the county are investing into housing and homeless services. Mayor, before we lose this group, could we ask the kids to come out and stand with us and get a picture?",portland
09_30_2015,homeless,"It is this second group that I would like to focus on [ORGANIZATION]. The problem lies with behaviors, persons choosing to commit crime instead of focusing on specific populations. It's not illegal to be homeless, and I am a homeless rights advocate, but committing crimes is what is illegal, and I think that is what we should enforce.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless,"And so you can see on the handout, I'm advocating for increased foot patrol in [ORGANIZATION], more consistent enforcement of existing laws regarding camping, school zone drug use, etc., reaching out to other cities such as [ORGANIZATION] that has put together some great plans and has had really effective outcomes from their housing the homeless with long-term housing, more aggressive officer recruitment.  and also creating an urgent plan and solution for indoor housing. Thank you. Thanks very much.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless,"Okay. $9.92, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding her backyard homeless transitional camp.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless,"They finally figured out they have homeless in [ORGANIZATION]. So it was packed. We had 150 people there, standing room only.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless; homelessness,"We cannot confuse, which I applaud the gentleman over here, criminality with homelessness. They're not synonymous. The homeless people that I represent do not want the criminals there anymore.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless,"Sometimes their lives involve criminal activity such as drug use. So what I'm saying is we need to be progressive here, and I want to really applaud Mayor [PERSON] over this declaration of emergency for homeless. that is very progressive.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless,Because homeless people provided the intel to get them. They don't want the drug dealers out there. They don't want any of these people out there.,portland
09_30_2015,homeless,People have got to stop confusing criminals with homeless. They are not the same. Thank you.,portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"I'm sorry, in [ORGANIZATION]. And we are here [ORGANIZATION] to present an update, which the first report drew on current market data  to provide city council with its first real-time look at the state of [ORGANIZATION]'s housing market. In the second and final phase of the report, we continue to assess the market, but we also look inward and provide an honest self-evaluation of the progress towards the city's affordable housing goals that were established in various planning documents going back to [LOCATION].",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"A detailed look at [ORGANIZATION] production shows more than 1,100 new units of affordable housing currently in development, including more than 170 targeted towards extremely low-income households. And these 1,100 units represent when they're built, and occupied represent an 8.4% increase in the city's affordable housing supply. But overall, I think as everybody realizes, the picture painted by this report calls for urgency around resource generation solutions.",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"[TIME], I announced that we will shortly be issuing a [ORGANIZATION], or RFP, upwards of $60 million DATE0.  for affordable housing production, which we estimate will fund and construct about 600 more units of affordable housing. And the city and the county have made significant commitments of general fund resources, as well as setting aside our urban renewal dollars. And to reach the goals that represent the values that [ORGANIZATION]ers have for our city, which is to achieve true income diversity in all of our neighborhoods,  to ensure the families that work in [ORGANIZATION] can afford to live in [ORGANIZATION], and to ensure that long-term residents who are living on fixed incomes will have a [STREET], a comfortable, safe and comfortable [STREET] to live when they retire.",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"To achieve these visions that all Portlanders share, we do need more income sources for affordable housing. And towards that end, as I mentioned, we talked about the $60 million we're releasing for investment shortly. We're also in the final stages of crafting an incentive zoning proposal, which will go before council [ORGANIZATION], which could produce upwards of $10 million a year for affordable housing.",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] will have a chance to increase the amount of urban renewal dollars that is dedicated to affordable housing. And I will be asking the council for a hefty increase in the percentage that we devote because this city needs it. And I'll also be asking to move forward with a linkage fee for affordable housing, which measures a linkage fee study would measure the impact that new developments create on the need for affordable housing.",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"And we would be able, if according to the study goes well, be able to charge developers an assessment based on that impact. And we will reintroduce, late breaking news, the proposal to dedicate the short-term lodging rental tax to affordable housing. We will be bringing that back.",portland
09_30_2015,homelessness,"The, um,  Income disparities are widening significantly. And as mentioned [TIME], homelessness is intractable. Statistically, not increasing, but not diminishing at the level that we would like to see.",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"And while there's a lot of information here I'm not going to cover at all, I wanted to hit the high points first. And I could say that with respect to [ORGANIZATION], the DATE0 Comprehensive Plan and [ORGANIZATION], we're generally meeting targets as it relates to the distribution of affordable housing, the opportunities for racial equity, and accommodating a diversity of household incomes and household types. There are many measures called for in those plans, and we've achieved about half of those measures [LOCATION].",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"However, on the flip side, the other half of those measures we did not accomplish. The city was preempted in the legislature from enacting excise tax for affordable housing. It has been further stymied in its efforts to –  to link growth and development to affordable housing programs and availability.",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"The financial resources have generally fallen short, and programming outside of the urban renewal areas has fallen short. I want to highlight the central city no net loss policy because I think it really is perhaps the biggest shortcoming to report to you. and that is that there was a very strong aspirational goal to ensure that there was no net loss of affordable housing in the central city.",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"The dedicated affordable units that we're short of. We're seeing growth in [ORGANIZATION], but we're not seeing dedicated affordable units in [ORGANIZATION] to the same proportion that the policy called for. Well, I think that someone in the [ORGANIZATION] area would say that's a good thing, that previously they had more than their share of affordable housing.",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"Just because it's affordable [ORGANIZATION] doesn't mean there's anything in [STREET] to keep it affordable in the future, and that's what the sad story is of the downtown no-net-loss policy. So we could lose those units to the market in [LOCATION] quite easily. So it sounds like you're proposing to build our [STREET] out of losing affordable housing, that the only [STREET] we can keep the housing affordable is for us.",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"I last worked in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], which for [ORGANIZATION] has been doing inclusionary housing for both ownership and rental ownership. there's about 2,700 units of affordable housing on the ground that were developed under their affordable 20-unit ordinance. There's another 4,500 in the pipeline, mostly in the [ORGANIZATION] corridor, which is the metro rail corridor between GPE2 and GPE3",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"So there's nothing we can do. Can we add additional fees if there isn't affordable housing? Well, the current fee structure, I think, has to be related to actual impacts.",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"Yeah, that's it. Yeah. So we'll continue to track those separately because, you know, sometimes the most affordable housing is the housing you already have, right?",portland
09_30_2015,homelessness,"A question about homelessness. You used the figure 3,800. What's your citation for that number?",portland
09_30_2015,homelessness,"You said 3,800 has remained fairly static. It's intractable. And here's the challenge that I think we have talking about homelessness.",portland
09_30_2015,homelessness,"Let's take the period of time on the [ORGANIZATION] plan that we surveyed. If you look at the beginning of the [ORGANIZATION] plan and at the end of the [ORGANIZATION] plan, you look at the data, it's very easy to say there's still homelessness, therefore it's an intractable problem, or if you're predisposed ideologically, you say it was a failure. But during that time, 13,000 people went from the streets to homes.",portland
09_30_2015,homelessness,"And the thing that our vocabulary or our discussion never accounts for is supply. If in the middle of a [ORGANIZATION] plan you have the greatest recession in [LOCATION] and people are being thrown out of their homes and falling into poverty and collapse the mental health system, how do we account for the fact that unlike a lot of other cities where per capita the number has gone up, [ORGANIZATION], record numbers, [PERSON], federal judge saying 50,000 unsheltered, numbers exploding. How do we account for the fact that our programs have created some stability while also acknowledging that any homelessness is still unacceptable?",portland
09_30_2015,homelessness,"It might even become a federal concern someday. I guess the point I'm saying is that I think the mistake that sometimes happens, not by the advocacy community but by the people that judge us, is that somehow homelessness is static. Therefore, if it starts at a number and ends at a number, we can make a judgment.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless; homelessness,"And I realize it's not even fashionable to say it, but I would be very demoralized if I was an advocate in the homeless movement and I'd move thousands and thousands of people to safe [INSTITUTION], but people keep saying, well, you're failing because there's still homelessness.  because you're not accounting for the fact that you don't control the supply, and you're not really accounting for the fact that you've moved thousands more than the static numbers show. And my analogy is, if you're going to be consistent, then we ought to just say, you know, that because [ORGANIZATION] is a sinner, [ORGANIZATION] has failed, because... Who says [ORGANIZATION] is a sinner?",portland
09_30_2015,homelessness,But it doesn't mean that we haven't had success with our systems getting people off the [STREET]. It just may mean that we don't control all the factors that push people into homelessness. We don't send people to war.,portland
09_30_2015,homeless,"Any further questions? Just to answer your question on the 3800, it is the [ORGANIZATION] homeless definition from [ORGANIZATION] point in time. Just typically when we produce the data, we're talking about literally individuals on the [STREET] and in shelter.",portland
09_30_2015,affordable housing,"I can say that we will come back to you on a [ORGANIZATION] basis with reports, and we are going to start producing case studies for every one of our funded projects that you have a –  a growing compendium of successful examples of how affordable housing can fit into neighborhoods and how it can help serve our housing needs. So thank you very much for the opportunity to be here. And there are some of those case studies in the back of this report.",portland
09_30_2015,homeless; homelessness,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm a member of [ORGANIZATION], on whose behalf I speak [ORGANIZATION]. First, I'd like to thank you for producing this informative report. I'd like to return to the topic of homelessness, specifically as it relates to a homeless camp that Mayor [PERSON] has endorsed near the intersection of FAC0 and FAC1 in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
09_30_2015,homeless,"Safety of people who live in a homeless camp is paramount, but the problems do not end with just their well-being.

The traffic issues there in terms of incidences that can happen between the high flow of traffic, the high speed of traffic, and these pedestrians that result in patients coming to my trauma hospital unable to care for themselves prior to or after discharge is extremely unfair to these individuals.",portland

11_03_2021,affordable housing,"The affordable housing process is markedly different from and less flexible than that of market developments. Decreases in review time and removing risk of high impact, costly changes, which could derail a project late in the review process, helps public dollars go further and opens the door for providing affordable housing where it previously been considered too risky or infeasible. all while providing thoughtfully designed additions to historic areas and increasing opportunities for adaptive reuse of historic buildings",portland

Third, expand the idea of the city's built history to include sites important to a wide array of marginalized groups rather than just the craftsman bungalows of the wealthy.",portland
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"This certainty is especially important for financing affordable housing. Amendment number three, change all historic resource type three reviews to type two staff reviews. This is both faster, less expensive, while preserving discretion of [ORGANIZATION] should a project be appealed.",portland
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"All right, great. To those who've literally said, burn it down, there are many inclusive ways we can add more affordable housing here in [ORGANIZATION] and other historic districts without demolishing the oldest homes. For example, adaptive reuse.",portland
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"Otherwise, the only housing added will be market rate, which defeats the stated aims. Notice the lot on FAC0 added a duplex with each unit now listed for $800,000. We can look to FAC1 for a shining example, adding to a historic building site more than 100 units of affordable housing because the city is giving $20 million in subsidies.",portland
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"We were pleased to know that our newly adopted city, like [ORGANIZATION] we had just left, had an appreciation for preserving and protecting its history and celebrating its craftsmen and artisans.

11_03_2021,affordable housing,"Help us do that by clearly defining what those expectations are and refining the scope of the guidelines. As we look to the future of historic designations, we want to emphasize that not only will the recommendations noted provide affordable housing in currently designated areas and structures, but it also helps ensure affordable housing can be provided in future historic resources to help prevent future displacement and vulnerable residents, taking [ORGANIZATION]'s preservation efforts in a direction that is much more equitable and responsive to the needs of all [ORGANIZATION]ers.

You know, I'd like to just say, I think everybody at this meeting is passionate about creating more affordable housing.

Currently, if inclusionary housing is triggered in historic districts that do not have a design overlay zone designation, no extra height is granted to offset the requirement for affordable housing.",portland
11_03_2021,affordable housing,"This generally makes the increased FAR unusable and is stopping the development of affordable housing on non-historic sites within many historic districts. Historic districts that happen to have a design overlay zone are getting both height and FAR, but those without an overlay do not, even though both receive design review from [ORGANIZATION].

Lord knows we have other infrastructural needs like affordable housing that we should be thinking about how we allocate money towards.

11_14_2018,homeless,"And given that some people are so vulnerable and isolated that they won't seek out services themselves, we have a whole team of outreach workers who are in the community conducting supportive housing assessments on the streets and in people's camps. Right now, we have about 1,300 chronically homeless people who have been assessed through coordinated access and are waiting to be matched for an appropriate supportive housing unit.

11_14_2018,homelessness,"Lastly, I also want to talk a little bit about [ORGANIZATION] experience operating and managing low barrier housing for very low income individuals. [ORGANIZATION], I think [ORGANIZATION], there was a study in [PERSON] that came out that talked about the correlation between the loss of [ORGANIZATION] housing to the rise of homelessness in that city. And I think since [LOCATION]...  about 14,000 units of [ORGANIZATION] housing, they started losing about 75% of their 14,000 [ORGANIZATION] units.",portland
11_14_2018,homelessness,"And concurrently, they saw a rise in homelessness. I think the city's acquisition of the [ORGANIZATION] is a great step forward to reversing trends like that in our city. [TIME], I was just there and just seeing kind of how neglected the property is.",portland
11_14_2018,affordable housing,"There was  following the kind of plaster and I think a lot of people, there were hoarding activities and very filthy conditions. And so the city's acquisition of [ORGANIZATION] is really critical in not only reversing the role of providing more affordable housing, but really kind of helping those who have been most marginalized to get connected to services. In terms of assets, as you know, [PERSON], the three arms, four arms of our organization is health services, behavioral health, employment services, and housing, supportive housing services.",portland
11_14_2018,homeless,"And that was a line of argument used at editorial board meetings and some public meetings Well, clearly the public rejected that scare, that fear-mongering that happened during the campaign. But I think it is fair to ask you, from your position, what's the most persistent myth that we have to sort of address about why it is nationally it's become a best practice to provide a deeply affordable rental apartment with services to help chronically homeless people get back on their feet?",portland
11_14_2018,homeless,I don't know. I don't know. I really don't know certainly one of the myths around the homeless is that the homeless want to be on the streets that they don't want to be in housing,portland
11_14_2018,homelessness,"and I guess that's a myth about homelessness that I see as being perpetuated yes And I can also kind of speak to that. I think [ORGANIZATION]'s approach is to provide comprehensive services, employment, housing, supportive housing, and mental health and primary care.",portland
11_14_2018,homelessness,"And I think what we've seen is, you know, people who come through our housing, they are desperately want to –  want to have safety and security, employment. And within our organization, what I see my staff is, who have kind of come through the ladder from homelessness to voluntary through our community volunteer corps to getting employment,  What I see is some of our best employees are actually people who have come from homelessness through recovery.

12_11_2019,homeless,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I am a homeowner homeowner on FAC0 and FAC1 I am here [ORGANIZATION] to talk about the livability and safety issues We have in connection with [ORGANIZATION] and the lack of sidewalks and streetlights on our [STREET] I have passed out a map showing the location we are talking about and the pictures highlighting issues with homeless campsites these pictures were taken over [LOCATION] span and sometimes these sites took over DATE2 to clear and  We have [TIME] parking signs that are not enforced regularly. The problem has been chronic on this [STREET].,portland
12_11_2019,homeless,"We have requested sidewalks and streetlights to be put in for [ORGANIZATION] now. They will deter homeless camping, and with the influx of crime and drugs on our [STREET], we also are asking for streetlights to be put in so this area is not so ideal for drug use and sales. We recommend that [ORGANIZATION] secure their parking lot after [TIME] for the safety of our neighbors.",portland

There's been an uptick in property damage, theft, and waste over [ORGANIZATION], and the cause is...  drug use and drug epidemic in general. And we know that's a problem the country faces, and [ORGANIZATION] in particular with the number of houseless, which we have an immense amount of compassion for.",portland
12_11_2019,homeless,Thank you. So obviously the number one issue facing this city is the homeless crisis. And it's not just [ORGANIZATION].,portland
12_11_2019,homeless,"No pun intended. My piece of this, I will raise these issues with [ORGANIZATION] directly and through the [ORGANIZATION] Office of Homeless Services, and we'll have that conversation. But I appreciate your being here [ORGANIZATION] and expressing your concerns directly.",portland
12_11_2019,homeless,"So it is legitimately a thoroughfare. We have [ORGANIZATION] right there and I think that we are unique in that [STREET] that we have a [ORGANIZATION], you know, a homeless services [STREET]  right next to our actual homes.",portland
12_11_2019,homeless,"Next individual, [ORGANIZATION], on a slightly different subject, I believe. Item [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding, yes, [ORGANIZATION], the homeless cure. Good morning.",portland
12_11_2019,homeless,"Today I would like to present a summary of my previous four visits to this council. On [ORGANIZATION], I covered homeless issues and the need for 400 acres to create a rehabilitation community, village, and farmland. The message was how we plan to graduate 500 job-ready individuals [LOCATION] through mentoring interaction along with job and personal community skills.",portland
12_11_2019,homeless,"To begin, we could use a portion of the city-owned golf courses or set aside 10 acres of the proposed FAC0 and allow YES to build a 50-acre apartment to house 100 rehabilitated, job-ready employees to build and maintain this treatment plant. and all of the above are people that we are gathering off the [STREET] and offering them a better [STREET] to live with advancement opportunities like education, clean food and water. On [ORGANIZATION], besides all the crying that went on in here on [ORGANIZATION], I covered homeless and foster children.",portland
12_11_2019,homelessness,"On [ORGANIZATION], I covered mental health and suicide and the demanding need for better care and equipped to help bring meaning and peace to [LOCATION]. DATE2, undereducated students that go on to be more prone to homelessness, low-paying jobs, and addiction. The YES Campus will follow these kids through a successful graduation with job-ready skills.",portland
12_11_2019,homeless,"The reason for the YES Plan is to add a much-needed feature that no other plan before has offered –  Safe, caring, education, on-the-job training, self-esteem building, purpose, and successful interaction. With these skills, their chance of becoming homeless is less than 20%. The present situation, we will see more than 80% back on the [STREET].",portland
12_11_2019,homeless,"Yes, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] is a middleman between all agencies that deal with systems that are presently not sufficiently communicating. First, the evaluation center, a chosen panel of experts, will conduct an intensive evaluation of each individual and choose their destination. This eval center will take over the present shelter locations and be used for temporary housing until the evaluations are complete.",portland
12_11_2019,affordable housing,"an opportunity we have in [ORGANIZATION] to do something really big and to get it right. And when I say get it right, I mean the inclusiveness, I mean the actual density that needs to be in that particular area to kind of deal with what we need in affordable housing. And it just reminds me of when you try to be excited about something that's really hard to be excited about.",portland
12_11_2019,housing crisis,"Yes, it's an extra expense, but it creates so much more livable of a neighborhood. And I think another thing that's very different now is there is a housing crisis. There is a climate crisis.",portland
12_11_2019,affordable housing,"These are envisioned to be primarily ownership, but they could be a variety, and we've had some discussions with even affordable housing providers that might be interested in a component of this. And this is a rendering of what that might look like as it interfaces the existing FAC0, although I would mention that the edge of the park here currently was not designed  with anticipation of housing development on that side. So there might be some opportunity for future work with parks to kind of rethink how that park interfaces.",portland
12_11_2019,affordable housing,"Well, this site is full of such exciting potential for density, for affordable housing. I'm also a big fan of the repurposed barn. Please don't tear that barn down.",portland
12_11_2019,homeless,"Mr. [PERSON] first began his work at [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], managing an innovative homeless housing program known as [ORGANIZATION].

12_11_2019,homeless,"I'm really happy to be here. I haven't been at this desk for quite a while, and so it's good to be back in front of [ORGANIZATION], and particularly for [ORGANIZATION], because...  Of the many employees at [ORGANIZATION], I've known him for a long time and worked directly with him and have some clear idea of the kinds of things and the impact he's had on the homeless people and people who are in recovery and people who are coming out of the prisons and the criminal justice system. So...",portland
12_11_2019,homeless,"So we were talking about, I was talking with him about the,  the intensive building trades training program that was a grant from the city.

11_25_2015,houseless,"Thank you. Okay, [DATE], please. [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address [ORGANIZATION] regarding houseless issues.",portland
11_25_2015,houseless,I'm here to talk about some issues like needing more showers and laundry facilities for the houseless. You know there's tons of soap that I've received  but no water or [STREET] to bathe. Public bathhouses or bathtubs wouldn't be a bad idea.,portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"as mixed-use buildings, and fewer abandoned houses, though that's another issue that we need to take on. But I'm, like a lot of people in [ORGANIZATION], less happy with what's happening to our existing housing stock in neighborhoods and the demolition of great old houses being replaced by much larger, more expensive houses is a problem not just for one house at a time but for the very character of our neighborhoods. the average difference between a house that was purchased and demolished and the house that replaced it is nearly $300,000 so this is not the provision of new affordable housing by any stretch",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, in the paragraph above. Okay, so now that section would read, Subsequent housing development following demolition that qualifies as affordable housing is determined—  by [ORGANIZATION] applying the criteria established in [DATE] may apply for and obtain rebates of up to $25,000, subject to guidelines developed by [ORGANIZATION]. So that's the affordable housing rebate that remains, but the rebate for tearing down one house and building two would go away if we approve this amendment.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Got that right. So I guess I'm now confused. No, this is just the affordable housing one.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,Is it [PERSON] who's going to develop the guidelines or ORG1? The amendment...  Mayor that Commissioner [PERSON] is calling Mayor 1 doesn't touch that first paragraph. I think Commissioner [PERSON] is suggesting we treat that as a third or as a separate amendment to amend the language regarding a rebate for affordable housing.,portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Okay. Now, Commissioner [PERSON], I think you wanted to also amend the – you talked about another amendment. I think there may be up to three competing amendments on the affordable housing exemptions.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Family member, the developer. I mean, someone does a proxy purchase to get the rebate, and then [ORGANIZATION] determines that the house wants to put the market on the house, so sells it at below market value.  to a proxy person to get the rebate and then puts it on at whatever the full market is? Well, my understanding is that for the existing [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing ORG1 waiver, that I made my staff ask [PERSON] whether there's any guard against that sort of insider dealing for the ORG1 waiver.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, [ORGANIZATION], are you ready? Yeah. So my amendment is I think we're all operating in the same spirit here, and that is an exemption for...  uh affordable housing and what i'm proposing is we simply follow the the guidelines the housing bureau already sets for the home ownership limited tax exemption program where we determine [ORGANIZATION] or the [ORGANIZATION] determines [ORGANIZATION] a price a sales cap price in order to qualify that a home must sell for or less in order to qualify for stc waivers and property tax exemption for the purchaser and so it simply ties  the rebate to that sales price cap that ORG1 sets [LOCATION].",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"I mean, the point you make about a waiver versus a rebate is a good point. I think it applies to everything we're talking about here, though. We've had some folks in the affordable housing community just argue that a waiver is cleaner, and they have a track, particularly when it's a [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] or someone that we know has a track record of  doing this kind of housing, but if you do it as a rebate, they have to finance the cost up front and then apply for the rebate.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"I think that is possible, and I think that's something that could be worked out with administrative rules. PERSON0 on Commissioner [PERSON]'s staff indicated one of her objectives in referencing the [ORGANIZATION] program is that it is a program that  affordable housing developers apply for prior to actually developing and starting construction. So we would have those commitments in [STREET] quite early in the development process, and it would at least, I think, give us the opportunity to shorten a period of  where the $25,000 might have to be carried.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And I'd like to find a mechanism that treats it as a lien or some other [STREET], suspends an actual cash payment where we have that affordable housing commitment. So it's your preference. We haven't seen Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendments.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"The most affordable home is the one that is already standing. And once these homes are demolished, they are gone forever, taken out of service forevermore. By charging developers $25,000 for each home they demolish for the  purpose of helping fund affordable housing efforts, this at least creates a revenue source to help families stay in [ORGANIZATION] who are otherwise being priced out from both rental housing and homeownership, and addresses the cost of the loss of affordable housing to our rapidly changing community.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"The [ORGANIZATION] editorial also cites aesthetic objections of neighbors as a primary justification for this tax. While the building of a house that is three times the size of the house demolished certainly runs counter to the comprehensive plan stated objective of preserving neighborhood character, the primary target of this disincentive tax is not the size of the replacement houses,  but to preserve the existing houses. And where the tax is not successful in deterring demolition, the tax revenue will be used to help fund affordable housing programs, which is only fair since every demolition is, in effect, a cost to the neighborhood in terms of livability and health.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"In conclusion, this is more than just a vote to impose a tax. It's an opportunity to send the message that,  that willy-nilly demolitions in our neighborhoods for the purpose of building million-dollar replacement homes with little or no regard to existing residences or the need for affordable housing is not what [ORGANIZATION] is all about. Thank you.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"I live in northeast [ORGANIZATION], and I work with [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], whose work is endorsed by 43 neighborhood associations, supports the demolition tax as a [STREET] to maintain and fund viable, affordable housing while also better distributing the costs of trash and build development. The loss of housing is real, exacerbated by developers now eliminating homes to merely put the lots on the market, this during a declared housing emergency.",portland
11_25_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"I'm here [ORGANIZATION] representing [ORGANIZATION], which is an organization of 115 area organizations working to increase dedicated funding in the [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] region to build, preserve, and support affordable housing. And we're here to strongly support the proposed demolition tax. Obviously, this new tax alone cannot fix our affordable housing crisis, but it is one more tool in our toolbox of revenue and policy solutions toward an equitable [ORGANIZATION] where everyone can find a [STREET] to call home.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"If I may comment in regard to some of the many amendments that are on the table, obviously we strongly support the exemption for nonprofit housing. I really appreciate that being put forward, and we're sure that our city staff can capably work through the complexities of figuring out how to make that work, but we really appreciate the intent to not add to the already high costs of providing affordable housing. We need to reduce those costs wherever possible in that burden.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And we also would love it if the currently existing loophole for partial demolition, where you tear down almost, but not entirely, the whole building, if there's a [STREET] to close that loophole, that would be an even better policy. So on the whole, we're very happy to support this new policy and really appreciate your leadership to seek new and dedicated revenue streams to permanently close the gap on our affordable housing shortfall. It's a great first step for [ORGANIZATION] and a good step forward for housing equity in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Houses are being demolished. And a lot of us have a lot of concerns about the direction of the city, and I think that the demolition tax would really address a lot of these issues. My two biggest concerns are that we have an extreme lack of affordable housing and that we're allowing too many of our historic structures to be torn down.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"So, I think that we really do need stricter controls for demolishing houses. We need affordable housing. Rents are going crazy.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And if we don't do something, then quickly, people are not going to be able to afford to live in the city that they've lived in. So, affordable housing definitely needs attention. And this, to me, seems like a very neat, tidy [STREET] to address these two issues.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,I'm a home builder. I've spent my whole career since DATE0 building primarily affordable housing. It's what I do.,portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Of course, to affordable housing is the main priority. Another concern I have is people selling the houses in the neighborhoods. Why don't the neighborhood associations get together with them and say, why don't you put something in a covenant or something in an agreement that states you don't want this to be demolished and only will sell it to somebody that wants to rehab the property?",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"I'll try to be even [TIME] because I think I'm here to suggest that you're going in the right direction with this tax. It really could be, as [ORGANIZATION] said from [ORGANIZATION] on, I join her voice in... This effort to create yet another source, another tool in our extraordinary effort to deal with this crisis we have here in our wonderful city around affordable housing.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,I appreciate Commissioner [PERSON]'s effort to expand our choices. Thank you. We do need to talk about establishing permanently affordable housing.,portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"We think the money raised from the demolition tax will not of itself solve our affordability housing issues, but even if only half of the current 400 homes that are demolished end up paying that tax, that is $5 million towards this very important goal of affordable housing. And, of course, we hope some of that affordable housing will be created in historic buildings. Thank you.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I represent [ORGANIZATION], which is a collaborative effort of four community development organizations in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, and [PERSON]. Our first major concern, which we relayed to you in written communication you've already taken care of, which was to add an exemption, an upfront exemption for demolitions that will result in affordable housing.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"So it's a wonderful exception, but it's an exception. And so I guess it goes to the point, though, because we have – and I have my share of qualms with this proposal. I'm not trying to mislead you here, but –  It does seem that we use a very elastic definition of what's affordable housing sometimes in these debates.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And I guess I'll put it to you as I'm interested just from a policy point of view. Does imposing an additional $25,000 on a transaction where the house is going to be sold for between $700,000 and $1 million, does that work against any definition of affordable housing goals in our city? Okay.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,You may disagree with the policy. You may disagree with the tool. But is there any conceivable affordable housing goal of the city that that offends?,portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"But our hands are tied because they have more influence in [ORGANIZATION] than we do. So on this one, does it offend an affordable housing goal to add $25,000 if it truly is a pass-through to someone buying a house between $700,000 and $1 million? Well, you know, I would suggest, Commissioner [PERSON], that the issue can be looked at in two lenses.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"You're talking about housing affordability and affordable housing. And so if it's an affordable housing goal and does $25,000 offend the notion, I apologize, I'm not quite understanding. One of your members –  who's thinking about tearing down a house and building a bigger house, has to add $25,000, decides to add $25,000, see if they can collect an additional $25,000, in other words, pass this cost through.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And in my neighborhood, by the [STREET], people are strategically listing prices at a ridiculous number, and then there's a bidding war that goes above that. So we're in an uncharted territory in terms of what people are willing to pay, apparently, at this high end. Does it offend any affordable housing goals that I know the [ORGANIZATION] cares about and we work on?",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"take that density piece out, and that's clear. Well, at some point, because the home builders have worked with us on lots of affordable housing initiatives, your foundation does amazing work, I'd be interested in continuing this discussion around things we can support together. And I appreciate that this is a tool that you don't support.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And I'd be interested in what tools we could support. And again, most of them seem to be preempted.  by the state legislature. And I'd love to find something that you and I could together go to [ORGANIZATION] and agree as a tool that we should use for affordable housing.",portland
11_25_2015,homeless,"So I know [ORGANIZATION] will, in the right context, question the market, even if it's just real estate, because the real estate market is seen in [ORGANIZATION], and it's seen when you walk down FAC0. FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION],  and now FAC0, FAC1, and [PERSON] look the same. They're full of buildings that have homeless people sleeping in front of them.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"That's a small part of the affordable housing thing. I know we have some things coming online, hopefully [TIME] and [ORGANIZATION] night, to start addressing that problem. But I'm not sure how much honesty and candor has been in some of this testimony.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"May we could start with having [ORGANIZATION] address Commissioner [PERSON] Desire for the view of the planning girls [ORGANIZATION] ORG2 Bureau planning and sustainability I think What you face is a balancing of two values the density  exemption within the single-family zones and the added lots that we get from that are actually a Small part of our future growth that we're planning on it's probably less than 10% of the 120,000 new units in [ORGANIZATION] and you offset that with the affordable housing fund revenue that you're generating and so in terms of how we meet our future growth projections and  You know, I think that ORG1 can go a long [STREET] towards helping us meet and create that affordable housing that offsets anything that we would lose because of the deterrent of a few infill lot splits. This might be a question better addressed to your co-ORG2, but I'm curious about the carbon emission impact.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Following the issuance of the demolition permit, the owner may apply for and obtain a temporary abeyance of the demolition tax assessment on the basis of subsequent development of affordable housing at the property. [ORGANIZATION] shall adopt administrative rules for qualifying, in this first instance of the word exempt, I would strike from this amendment. Okay.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"So it would read, [ORGANIZATION] shall adopt administrative rules for qualifying affordable housing as exempt from demolition tax using criteria under either  Section 30.01.095 or [ORGANIZATION], because I understand there were two proposals here. So that's a choice we have to make. A choice the council needs to make, correct.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And then continuing, if the subsequent housing development qualifies as affordable housing under [ORGANIZATION] administrative rules, the director, that would be the revenue director, shall determine that the demolition tax  But no demolition tax is due. So this is, in effect, a rewritten version of Commissioner [PERSON]'s. Exactly.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"And then there's another final piece of this is that subsequent housing development does not qualify as affordable housing. The director shall determine that the demolition tax assessment is due and payable. PERSON0, the virtue of Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendment was it's very straightforward and clear.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Yeah, because they're going to do administrative rules, which we'll look at to review. Oh. So then the modified language would be [ORGANIZATION] shall adopt administrative rules for qualifying affordable housing as exempt from the demolition excise tax, period.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"but i think we need to read into the record numbers one and two because i don't know that [ORGANIZATION] did that already right so numbers one and two below b that we just modified says if the subsequent housing development qualifies as affordable housing under  [ORGANIZATION] administrative rules, the director shall determine that no demolition tax is due. And two, if the subsequent housing development does not qualify as affordable housing, the director shall determine that the demolition tax assessment is due and payable.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Sorry. PERSON0. This really gets at the crux of, is this proposal for reducing demolitions, or is it for providing money for affordable housing?",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"What's the primary purpose of it? I think the most persuasive purpose is that it's for providing money for affordable housing. $375,000 is not affordable to a lot of Portlanders.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"For the median family income, $375,000 is not affordable. So the thought of giving a 50% rebate to properties that sell for 150% of median income  or medium sales price just doesn't meet my definition of what's affordable housing. And so I would like to have something like this.",portland
11_25_2015,affordable housing,"Now, if the council wants to respond to the testimony we heard that it ought to be assessing a tax for every residential unit, that would capture duplexes, nonconforming multifamily development, single-family homes where there's an interior accessory dwelling unit,  you know we would write it that [STREET] but as staff really understands it now a duplex would only require one permit and only one $25,000 tax would be applied  Or a clarification. I think if the goal is to reduce demolitions and to get more money for affordable housing, both, we want to make it apply to as much as possible. So to my mind, yes, you would charge $50,000 for a duplex being demolished.",portland

09_23_2015,homelessness,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome. We'll get to the council's regular calendar in a moment.

09_23_2015,homeless; homelessness,"The county chair and I have been working together in a wonderful partnership with [ORGANIZATION] to address the issue of veterans' homelessness. We started with about 690 homeless veterans in our city, and we're down to about 230. So by a concerted effort on something of an emergency basis, we've proved that we can actually move the needle.",portland
09_23_2015,homelessness,"So I believe that the [ORGANIZATION] cities that are dealing with housing affordability problems, with rising rents, and with intractable homelessness need to work together, and that's why I've invited those mayors along with the other [ORGANIZATION] mayors to a [ORGANIZATION] Mayors Conference here in [ORGANIZATION], and we'll continue our discussions together of those issues. But in the meantime, I think it's time for [ORGANIZATION] to act  and I believe [PERSON] is when we'll bring the ordinance forward for community discussion and for council action. So because that's going to be an important item for the council and an important item for the community, I just wanted to announce that it's coming.",portland

One of the issues I have on this whole situation here, again, is that when we're talking authorized to use the payroll deduction system, is that, as Mayor [PERSON] stated [ORGANIZATION], is that we are in a state of emergency pertaining to the homeless, to affordable housing issues. And until we start putting that at the top of the list, and as Commissioner PERSON3 has created the housing fund, which I don't see on this list, and number one, I'd like to know if payroll deductions can go toward the housing fund, which I thought was originally set up to do.",portland
09_23_2015,homeless,"I'd also like to have this at the top of the list due to that's a state of emergency. I'd like all the employees of the city of [ORGANIZATION] to understand that. that when you have homeless people scattered around on the sidewalks and the doorways, that is also your responsibility to make sure that there is a solution for that.",portland
09_23_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"that when we are in a state of emergency and other foundations can look to other areas to obtain their funding, the city and [ORGANIZATION]'s employees' first responsibility should be the homeless, should be to affordable housing. And that is my position. Thank you for your time.",portland
09_23_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]'s not here to respond, so I'll do so on his behalf. The fund you're referring to is [ORGANIZATION]. and it is an entity into which [PERSON] has proposed putting general fund and other resources to build and preserve affordable housing.",portland
09_23_2015,homeless,"the [ORGANIZATION] twice at FAC0 where there were officers, both fare inspectors and police officers, rushing onto the train, obviously targeting folks who may appear to be young or homeless. Frankly, it was a very frightening experience. I don't think that's a good...  [STREET] for us to get trust in our police officers when that's happening on our public transportation?",portland
09_23_2015,homeless,"The people understand the city want more oversight and regulation, and we can agree on a city fee for a business permit, but it should not include more stringent guidelines that already are outlined by state laws. I also urge you to review these fees so that they are fair to business owners rather than the noted fees listed at greater than 10% higher or [ADDRESS] state laws i again note that conflict will rise when already licensed state businesses and invested business owners  potentially fail to receive a new city permit under this more stringent guideline outlined in this ordinance.",portland

It's benefiting the intended populations that we're providing the funds for so that the property itself can achieve long-term sustainability.",portland
11_01_2017,homelessness,"Okay. So it's people being squeezed in this market, but it's unlikely that these are people also we're seeing on the sidewalks. And so my question to you, Director [PERSON], is given the council's renewed focus on meeting [STREET] homelessness and permanent supportive housing units, are we going to be changing the pipeline prospectively so that we are –  capturing the units we're going to need to meet our commitment to permanent supportive housing goals?",portland
11_01_2017,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] is not tracking the services, but we will be doing a deep dive with [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] to get to a sustainable package. And as you know, within the bond framework plan that you adopted as a council, there are some 2,000 – excuse me, 300 units of 0 to 30 units set aside for supportive housing. That will make a difference.",portland
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"So one of the things that's been mentioned by other people testifying on affordable housing is that – PERSON0, could you get a little closer just so we can hear you? I'm always afraid I'm getting too close. Is that just right?",portland
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"Okay. The affordable housing, the people that are sleeping on the sidewalks in tents have zero income. And how are they going to qualify for affordable housing when they have zero income?",portland
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"They are going to continue to be on the streets. They're going to fall through the cracks until we figure out a [STREET] to reach out and help them. And so this is just one idea that came to my mind, and I'd like to see, you know, [ORGANIZATION] kind of think outside of the box and think how can we –  qualify these people to take advantage of affordable housing.",portland
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"And I also want to say I really appreciate the conversation about the people whose incomes go up and the people who are burdened. In my particular situation, almost 60% of my [ORGANIZATION] goes to my rent in affordable housing. I could move into a smaller unit, but it would be [ORGANIZATION] before one would be available.",portland
11_01_2017,housing crisis,"I think the program's called Benefit. so that once we have someone in the system, we're certainly helping them access [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], food stamps, but it's incredibly challenging in the kind of situation that you mentioned. And I am actually curious, Director [PERSON], you mentioned that there's a federal policy of not evicting people once they...  disqualify income-wise, and I completely support not wanting to displace people during a housing crisis, even if their income is 100% of MFI, because we know they still can't afford market rate rents.",portland
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"But I am concerned that there could be people earning more than 100% of MFI who certainly could qualify, and they are taking up  precious spots in our affordable housing. And perhaps that's something we can't do anything about because of federal law. Well, since that's a question, I'd be happy to respond.",portland

And I wish I could tell you that the story had a happy ending.",portland
11_01_2017,homeless,"Yeah. But because he had been chronically homeless for so long, he really found it impossible to be a successful tenant. And ultimately, he took a trip, did not pay attention to any of the lease obligations, lost his apartment, and was back on the [STREET].",portland
11_01_2017,homeless,"And with that in mind, we need to really start addressing the manager on site, more specialized training in drug addictions, mental illness, and understanding on how to deal with, like was stated, a  that has been chronic homeless for [ORGANIZATION] and is adapting to living indoors again. And it's the same concept which I've been trying to push, is that in my belief, every person that's chronically homeless should be set up on the plan of receiving a certain amount of income per month at a certain point. And I've talked to you on that, and why that is is that  The trauma suffered over [LOCATION] is that we can't all just have that mindset is that just go out and get a job, everything will be fine.",portland
11_01_2017,affordable housing,"And I understand and agree with concerns about equity. There are reports, I think, that the public can access through the city that show how we're spending. And we are deeply investing in [ORGANIZATION] and parks and roads and affordable housing.",portland

11_23_2016,homeless,"Also, it was kind of nice seeing the reaction of homeless people upon learning that they would be receiving a care package. They felt that there was hope and there were some people caring for the homeless out there. Yeah.",portland
11_23_2016,homeless,"Well, and what else have you learned about [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless community? You've obviously met a lot of homeless people in this project. What advice do you have for us as a city council and for us as a city based on what you've learned by all this firsthand relationship?",portland
11_23_2016,homeless,"Okay. Well, what I'd say is that everybody can contribute in one [STREET], shape, or form, in one [STREET]. If we all work together, we can all help this homeless problem come to an end at last.",portland
11_23_2016,homeless,"Well, not just by making care packages, but by doing something for the homeless community, by having your [STREET] be open for the homeless people during [ORGANIZATION] so that they can have a nice good meal to eat. That's great. Well, you'll be happy to know that we're opening yet another shelter [LOCATION].",portland
11_23_2016,homeless,"Let's hear from Mr. [PERSON], [DATE]. Item [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding criminal activity at homeless camp and law enforcement. Thank you for coming.",portland
11_23_2016,homeless,"Before you sigh and think, oh, another complaint about the homeless, please understand that this is not a homeless issue. There are many homeless living in [ORGANIZATION], living in cars, tents, and sometimes just under a tarp. We as a community feel for these people, have gotten to know many of them by name, and we do what we can for them.",portland
11_23_2016,homelessness,"This is not about them. This is about criminals using the disguise of homelessness to wreak havoc on our neighborhood. We as a community learned that the city of [ORGANIZATION], for all practical purposes, does not distinguish nor recognize that there are two distinct groups of people living on our streets, one that deserves our compassion, our help and support, and one that deserves our vigilance and strict enforcement of our laws.",portland
11_23_2016,homeless,"By not recognizing these two distinct groups, we allow the genuinely homeless to be stereotyped as criminals and also allow them to be victims of crime themselves by the same people. It took over [ORGANIZATION] for our community through constant phone calls to multiple agencies, media outlets, and outreach organizations to remove this criminal enterprise from our streets. It should not be that difficult.",portland
11_23_2016,homeless,"The police responded half a dozen times, the [INSTITUTION] twice for two fires that were burning there, [ORGANIZATION] more, all this money that can be spent elsewhere helping the genuinely homeless. What can be done? I propose that the city recognize that there are two camps of homeless that, when identified, need to be held accountable for their actions through timely enforcement of current laws.",portland
11_23_2016,homeless,"I propose that criminal camps, once identified, be given a single reference number that can be used by the police, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2, and other city offices involved in these issues to make it easier for communities to more effectively engage the city to deal with their criminal activity. Again, we all understand that there's a homeless problem, and this is not about them. These people need protection from the criminal part of this as well.",portland
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"In your impact statement for the council, it lists public involvement, has a public involvement statement, and it says that you reached out to organizations representing communities of color and tenants, organizations,  organizations representing homeowners with low, moderate, or fixed incomes, and affordable housing advocates and program implementers. I would say, in light of the [ORGANIZATION] testimony, could you just tell us in writing which groups you reached out to that qualify for that, that are covered by those categories? And second, we had one or two people testify that this could alter the underwriting.",portland

While typical quarter block proposals in the central city typically have greater ground floor activation than this proposal does, the applicant felt that this amount of parking was critical to their particular affordable housing program.

Redesigning the exterior of the building and its structural plans to accommodate the changes that [ORGANIZATION] has requested will take additional time and money.,portland
11_23_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"This is why we cannot afford any more design changes that increase cost. We've made several of them early on, including increasing the size of the lobby, increasing storefront glass, and adding commercial space. we estimate that the changes we made in response to requests from the design commission planning staff and the neighborhood association resulted in [DATE] of cost to the project they were good changes and we are glad we made them but at this point the project is not able to absorb any more costs related to design redesigning to meet design commission's conditions will add 160 000 in known costs to our budget we just don't have it  What we have is a design that has the support of [ORGANIZATION], honors the site's industrial and cultural history in both its design and materials, demonstrates a diversity of design and creative energy that will speak to our new residents and create a welcoming space for them to call home, strongly relates to its current surroundings without mirroring the design of adjacent affordable housing, and is desperately needed by low-income and homeless families struggling to house their children.",portland

Besides practice, I also occasionally teach architectural design at [ORGANIZATION] State University and have previously taught at [ORGANIZATION].",portland
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"What I love about affordable housing is that residents come from diverse backgrounds. As in my own family, they often have one or two immigrant parents who bring with them a diversity of design sensibilities. In all these communities, there are artistic traditions in architecture, painting, and textiles that use repetitive patterns and bright colors and strong forms.",portland
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"Similarly, what is fascinating about [ORGANIZATION] history is that there's immigrants who settled near the rail yards, not just Europeans, but African Americans, Chinese, and Japanese workers and families. Our two-bay corner design is a nod to this more diverse history of the [PERSON]. We want to use strong forms to create a sense of excitement and inspiration in the urban streetscape as a [STREET] to symbolically connect families of affordable housing to the history of the [PERSON].",portland
11_23_2016,affordable housing,"And so from our team's point of view, having two bays is the central feature of the design.

As you know, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] voters approved the state's first voter-approved funding measure for affordable housing.

10_11_2017,homelessness; housing crisis,"These reports and others show that [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis disproportionately impacts people of color, low-income families, and individuals and families experiencing homelessness.

This is also true for low-income families and immigrants.",portland

People like [ORGANIZATION], who passionately implored you to declare a housing emergency,  People like PERSON1 and PERSON2 at [ORGANIZATION], who over [ORGANIZATION] have gently and not so gently reminded us of the shortage of affordable housing in our community for those extremely low-income individuals. And people like [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], who tirelessly advocated for additional local funding for affordable housing.",portland

10_11_2017,affordable housing,"And so what we've heard in the past is we'd like more home ownership, less of the affordable housing. What I think...  has been problematic about that approach is that there is still a concentration of low-income families attending schools there that have the right to live in safe and decent housing. And so it's been almost a schizophrenic approach.",portland
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"But you're particularly concerned about upgrading the existing stock so that we have an inventory of really decent housing going forward, and that might play into our investment strategy. Yeah, we have said for some time the stock out in [ORGANIZATION] is inferior, the private sector stock.

10_11_2017,affordable housing,"When I was on the [ORGANIZATION], because I have that school hat I can wear, and that's why you saw catchment areas mentioned, is that when you get too many affordable housing, whether it's design or not design, it puts additional costs on a school district.

10_11_2017,housing crisis,"And finally, I want to close on... Kind of a sour note we heard from a number of people that somehow this would not solve our housing crisis and that somehow this had been mismarketed. This alone is not going to solve our housing crisis.",portland
10_11_2017,homelessness,"Any more than 2,000 units of permanent supportive housing is going to solve our homelessness crisis. But I would remind people that you have to go back to [ORGANIZATION]. and [PERSON], who [ORGANIZATION] upstream said, if we starve the beast in [ORGANIZATION], we'll create a series of train wrecks down the line in the local government.",portland
10_11_2017,housing crisis,"PERSON0. As was said many times over [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION], we're in a housing crisis. The time for action is clearly upon us, and this council does have a sense of urgency with regard to the problem.",portland
10_11_2017,affordable housing,"We heard from members of the immigrant and refugee community,  that discriminatory practices were preventing them from finding quality, affordable housing. The oversight committee or the advisory committee, [ORGANIZATION], has told us they want that to be part of this framework. We heard from elected officials and community leaders that this is the experience of families across the metro area and throughout the state of [ORGANIZATION].",portland

10_31_2018,homeless,"Actually, they're the...  ugly concrete rounds that get picked by homeless folks seeking the recycling. And we wanted to put five of those cans there as well. But right now, [ORGANIZATION] is kind of more comfortable with the cans they have right now.",portland
10_31_2018,homeless,"We're going to have a community-wide conversation about livability issues, ranging from trash to graffiti to crime to the homeless situation,  There will be an opportunity for the community to come out and learn more about what the city is doing, how we can work together. The theme is communities and government working together. It will be at the main stage.",portland
10_31_2018,affordable housing,"Yeah, I think that would be a good thing to do, and then maybe if there were affordable housing or other projects that might need some assistance to do those energy efficiency, you could use the fund for that, for example. We can certainly research that. Commissioner [PERSON].",portland
10_31_2018,homeless,"Any city money going to the parks right now? You can fill all the parks in with concrete, build a wall, whatever.  because right now with all the homeless people and the people being kicked out of shelters or not wanting to go into shelters because they're so unhealthy, you've got transgender people who can't use the bathroom in FAC0 because you've closed it  and elderly and disabled. The woman who was kicked out of ORG0 because her bed wasn't paid for [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] or DATE2 night she was kicked out.",portland
10_31_2018,homeless,"If the homeless come, they arrest them or chase them off, or they pull...  the stuff that people use to use the park there, the chess boards or the games, they'll just pull them. So let's just build a wall around all the parks and fill them in with concrete because you're only going to let certain people use the facilities, the bathrooms. So yeah, you're arresting homeless women who come in there and scream because she needs adult protective services.",portland
10_31_2018,homeless,"Fair enough. Thank you. Senators need to stop paying for discrimination against elders, disabled, and homeless.",portland
10_31_2018,homeless,"PERSON0 [PERSON]. Welcome. On a similar topic of which I had discussed on [DATE], I, in the future, will mention one person's name who's a great homeless advocate is [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_31_2018,homeless,"And I know in [ORGANIZATION] what happened in the park, it was a federal park, in which he tried to establish a homeless encampment, and it was slammed down. I'm not here to say that that was a perfect [STREET] to do that, but again, I favor putting homeless people in parks in a very controlled fashion. I'm a supporter of [ORGANIZATION], and I know that she may put [PERSON] on her staff.",portland
10_31_2018,homeless,"PERSON0... And I meant about the Homeless Bill of Rights in [ORGANIZATION], in which I met you, Mayor [PERSON], and you were trying to get FAC0 built. Now, it will be built, and it may send and dispatch paramedics to homeless people who are cold or something, but I understand homeless people will not be allowed to stay there.",portland
10_31_2018,homeless,"At the [INSTITUTION], there are African Americans and other homeless people begging me for money. And I thought the navigation center...  would move people under FAC0 or move them away.

12_05_2018,affordable housing,"Consent agenda items are routine city administrative business, but [ORGANIZATION]'s consent agenda had a couple of items that I just want to briefly highlight. DATE1 we codify the results of the DATE2 election, specifically measures 26-200 and 26-201. We also have three inclusionary housing projects, which will provide 134 units of new rental housing, including 13 affordable housing units.",portland
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"Good morning, Mayor and Commissioners. I'm pleased to be here [TIME] to bring you this exciting new affordable housing project from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], located on the corner of FAC0 and FAC1. It's my honor to be here [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION]'s Executive Director, [ORGANIZATION], who served [ORGANIZATION] and her community for [LOCATION], and [ORGANIZATION]'s PERSON1 and PERSON2.",portland
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"Thirty-five percent of the units are set aside for very low-income families. The project is estimated to provide 198 new residents permanent affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east. This project is part of the city's comprehensive [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east Neighborhood Strategy, which both acknowledges and works to address our actions in regards to gentrification and displacement.",portland
12_05_2018,homeless,"This project, [ORGANIZATION], will prioritize families with long-term ties to the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east neighborhood and those who've experienced displacement, as well as serving 20 formerly homeless families with long-term voucher support. [ORGANIZATION] has partnered with ORG2 and [PERSON] and expects to well exceed the city's requirements for minority women and emerging business participation. I believe [PERSON] and her team will talk a little bit more about that, but they're expecting to reach 30% participation.",portland
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"From the city, we have $5.7 million in loans from [ORGANIZATION], additionally the contribution of the land. And from [ORGANIZATION], we have [ORGANIZATION] waivers, property tax exemption that's administered through ORG2 in partnership with [ORGANIZATION], and the Affordable Housing CET waiver. And additionally, home forward, we were awarded 20 project-based Section 8 waivers.  which allow us to lower the rent for our residents.",portland
12_05_2018,homeless,"Commissioner, most of the families are coming out of the homeless families service system, and they will be coming with service supports. But we have not required permanent supportive housing as an additional requirement on this project. And that was part of the [ORGANIZATION]?",portland
12_05_2018,homeless,"No.  The [ORGANIZATION] submitted the [ORGANIZATION] in serving homeless families, but we have not done an additional requirement for permanent supportive housing on this building other than the requirement for the 20 families that the [ORGANIZATION] already submitted for coming out of the homeless family system, which will have services. But the additional units will be prioritized from the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east preference policy strategy. Thank you.",portland
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"And so looking at how we can have an organization like ORG0 kind of lead the [STREET] in showing how we can address  the issues that exist in our communities around not only affordable housing, but the poverty that causes the need for it. Commissioner [PERSON] has talked about permanent supportive housing. And when I think about that term, I'm thinking, like, why does permanent  situations have to exist.",portland
12_05_2018,affordable housing,What is it? Can we do to look more deeply into what's causing that situation and come up with solutions? That's what we did with affordable housing.,portland
12_05_2018,homeless,"[LOCATION], there are two populations that are prioritized for this building. One is families coming out of the homeless family system that will be supported by vouchers from [ORGANIZATION]. So people with very low incomes will be able to afford permanent housing for themselves and family.",portland
12_05_2018,homeless; affordable housing,and also the priority of families or households that have historic ties or have been displaced from [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [ORGANIZATION] who would like to come back to [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [ORGANIZATION]. Both of these preferences have been thoroughly reviewed by fair housing attorneys and comply with fair housing law. So we're addressing both displacement and homeless families as well as adding new affordable housing stock with this project.,portland
12_05_2018,homeless,"So congratulations to [ORGANIZATION]. One of the things that I really like about this development is that of the 70 units, all of them will be affordable at 60 percent of MFI or below. And what that means is people on fixed incomes, people who are entry-level workers, people starting out, formerly homeless, are  In other words, it will be serving people that the market is not serving right now.",portland
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"when it comes to housing those of lower income or people who lack access to safe and affordable housing in our community. We all started at FAC0 with that ribbon-cutting ceremony. Then DATE0 we were at the [ORGANIZATION],  [PERSON]-cutting ceremony [TIME].",portland
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"We added a number of multi-units to our affordable housing mix, and now we have FAC0 and FAC1 to celebrate. I couldn't be happier to see these 70 units of affordable housing being added to the city's stock. And, of course, it's mostly targeted for northeast areas.",portland
12_05_2018,affordable housing,What? You're back again and you want 173 more units of affordable housing? We are.,portland
12_05_2018,homelessness,"It adds an additional 20 new units of low-barrier housing. And it seismically upgrades an unreinforced masonry building in the heart of the central city, ensuring resident safety and protecting an important community asset for [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to come. The [ORGANIZATION] serves a high needs population who receive supportive services and are transitioning from homelessness.",portland
12_05_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,I am PERSON0 with [ORGANIZATION]. FAC0 has long been a workforce in both [ORGANIZATION]s and the city's ending homelessness efforts. It's a rather unique affordable housing resource offering both transitional and permanent housing options to people with very high barriers to traditional housing pathways.,portland
12_05_2018,homeless,"Programs in the building include those serving homeless veterans, people transitioning from corrections, and recuperative care for homeless individuals with acute health conditions. You can see some of the outcomes of the building's programs on this slide. Over 750 people are served [ORGANIZATION] in FAC0.",portland
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"And so we're really looking to do an overall upgrade and put this project into use for [ORGANIZATION]. As [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, one of the aspects we're most excited about as part of this preservation is that we have found a [STREET] to add 20 additional new units of affordable housing into the building. This was accomplished by better utilization of space around light wells as well as capture of some of the first floor commercial space and was really no small victory given the fact that this is a building on the historic register and we had to go through [ORGANIZATION] approval, which if any of you have done that before, it's a timely and complicated endeavor.",portland
12_05_2018,homelessness,"You can still see the marble steps and areas of the building related to that use. We're also improving and expanding the community and service space in the building, which will help to strengthen our outcomes, which really are focused around health, income attainment, and social connectedness, all of which are vital for long-term improved resiliency to homelessness. And as also mentioned, we're seismically strengthening the building, including all new seismic cores, diaphragms, and masonry attachments.",portland
12_05_2018,affordable housing,"Well, the city is obviously pleased to see the addition of these new affordable housing units and the preservation of many, many others. The need is clearly withering. So this is something that's pretty easy to get behind.",portland
10_12_2016,homeless,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. As part of the [ORGANIZATION] budget approval in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] allocated $350,000 to a housing emergency community engagement plan spearheaded by [ORGANIZATION].

Those with lived experience with being houseless and low-income residents who are at risk of becoming houseless have historically been underrepresented in government decision-making processes, those issues with a direct impact on their lives.",portland
10_12_2016,housing crisis,"And additionally...  Many community and neighborhood activists had identified a need for more public information about the city's strategy for addressing the housing crisis, and they wanted to know what opportunities exist for community engagement so they could be constructively involved with solutions to the housing instability in our community. These are issues that came up, as Commissioner said, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] when community leaders brought these issues to us through our budget advisory committee process DATE2. So subsequently, [ORGANIZATION] approved this [ORGANIZATION] $350,000 with a budget note that we would return to ORG1 for approval of a plan.",portland

Two, community organizations working with individuals and families experiencing housing insecurity and homelessness will have expanded capacity to be able to engage more people and provide broader forums for the community to express their concerns, their needs, and issues that they want to organize around on these issues. Secondly, those organizations will be able to expand their capacity to build power to affect policy change and some of the long-term solutions towards ending the housing crisis.",portland
10_12_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And lastly, [ORGANIZATION]'s partner groups will have expanded capacity to collaborate with each other and other community-based groups and government agencies to better inform their constituencies about what's going on and how they can get involved in long-term solutions.

One, project grantees will work together with [PERSON] and ORG2 to help inform the public about the council adopted action plan to end homelessness.",portland

So specifically, there will be one competitive grant for $80,000 that will go to one of [ORGANIZATION]'s existing partner organizations for [ORGANIZATION] and limited program support. and they will help coordinate our working relationship with ORG2 to work with the various advisory committees and help disseminate information to project partners and the general public.",portland
10_12_2016,houseless,"Two, three... Two or three community organizations will be able to build their capacity for sharing information, leadership development, community engagement efforts, and public policy advocacy efforts. So there will be three competitive grants, each $80,000, that will help fund [ORGANIZATION] and limited program support, split evenly to organizations working for and with low-income tenants, the houseless, and communities of color, immigrants, and refugees.",portland
10_12_2016,housing crisis; houseless,"But over [ORGANIZATION], working with community groups, working with those most impacted by the issue, they made it clear that there was an equal need to build capacity in communities most impacted by the crisis, low income tenants and the houseless to help them build their capacity to effectively advocate for themselves. And then lastly,  Why community engagement when some have asked why community engagement when maybe these funds should just go directly to building housing? We face a long-term systemic housing crisis and best public involvement practices for achieving racial equity necessitate engaging those most impacted.",portland
10_12_2016,houseless,"The houseless and low-income tenants of which there is a disproportionate representation of people of color. And we just wanted to point out that city council adopted a racial equity goal.  that we will strengthen outreach, public engagement, and access to city services for communities of color and immigrant and refugee communities, and support or change existing services using racial equity best practices. And [ORGANIZATION] also adopted public involvement principles, which recognize ORG1 works best when community members and government work as partners.",portland
10_12_2016,homeless,Thank you for having me here [TIME]. I'm here [ORGANIZATION] in my role as the Director of [ORGANIZATION]. I also have the role of Initiative Director for [ORGANIZATION].,portland
10_12_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Over [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has included ORG1 and ORG2 in conversations with its community partners to craft the proposal that you have before you. The result of that process is a proposal that I believe will strengthen the role of community members, in particular those who are experiencing the housing and homeless crisis most acutely, in shaping our response to the crisis generally and through ORG1 more specifically. Among the core commitments of [PERSON] and of ORG2 is that the policies and programs we implement to prevent and end homelessness should be shaped by those with personal experience of housing instability and homelessness.",portland
10_12_2016,housing crisis,"That is why we've prioritized having people with lived experience on our coordinating board, our subcommittees, and why we have a [ORGANIZATION] forum that emphasizes soliciting the input of those who are living on our streets, in our shelters, and are using services in our system. The leadership development component of [ORGANIZATION]'s proposal promises to increase the number and diversity of people who are living the housing crisis DATE1, who have the tools they need to bring their perspectives to the various forums within ORG1, and to help us shape the best possible responses to the challenges that we face. Those tools will also be transferable to other local, state, and federal forums that also have to be part of any effective solution to our crisis.",portland
10_12_2016,homelessness; housing crisis,"The component of this proposal that focuses on helping community groups work with their members to evaluate and develop policy proposals to respond to the housing and homelessness crisis also aligns well with a home for everyone. Specifically, our commitment to a community-based process for identifying the best possible local policies and strategies for preventing and ending homelessness. We hold [ORGANIZATION] meetings of work groups on safety off the streets, housing, health care, employment, and veterans' needs,  These meetings are where we look to the community members to come forward with their recommendations for policies and programs that would allow us to better meet the needs of people experiencing a housing crisis.",portland
10_12_2016,homeless,"My hope is that the community-based policy work envisioned in this proposal will feed new ideas and strategies into these work groups and similar policy setting forums at the local and state level. And in turn, lead to new and effective responses to meet the needs of those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless in our community. Finally, as I understand this proposal, it would create an important bridge between a home for everyone, the joint office, and neighborhood associations.",portland
10_12_2016,homelessness,"We have had numerous stakeholders around the table at a home for everyone over [ORGANIZATION], but the role of the neighborhood associations has been relatively limited. That is a function, at least in part, of the fact that neighborhood associations were often not aware of the work happening within a home for everyone and how they could participate in that work. My hope and expectation is that the staff capacity envisioned here...  We'll help remedy that and increase the role of neighborhood associations in our work to end homelessness.",portland
10_12_2016,homeless; homelessness; housing crisis,"Should you approve this proposal, [ORGANIZATION] looks forward to working with ORG1 to realize the potential of these funds to, one, strengthen the voices of people with lived experience of the housing crisis in our community's efforts to address homelessness.

10_12_2016,housing crisis,"When we originally heard about the proposal coming forth out of [ORGANIZATION] and the community engagement process that was going to follow the award, we were really excited to know that the community had input in that. shaping this proposal and shaping how basically how we were going to address the housing crisis so I first want to say thank you so much for that opportunity and I'm really impressed with the [STREET] that community input was taken into consideration and molded into the proposal in a [STREET] that really facilitated what we believe at [ORGANIZATION] to be crucial in addressing the housing crisis which is community partners community-based organizations and the city partnering together to address our crisis and  I think, you know, to talk briefly about the concerns that were raised. regarding information sharing from the city to the community.",portland
10_12_2016,housing crisis,And so knowing that this housing crisis is significantly huge and knowing that the capacity that currently... It's great to see that this proposal includes investment in that one. Oops.,portland
10_12_2016,housing crisis,And we look forward to pushing forward in addressing this housing crisis. Thank you very much. Thank you.,portland
10_12_2016,housing crisis; houseless,"And so what this proposal do, we give the people that live inside a chance to meet with the people that's outside and hear that all houseless people are not drug addicts, are not ladies of the night, are not gang bangers, but because of the housing crisis that's happening all over this country, that people are living on the streets.  111 people move here [ORGANIZATION]. So if 111 people move here [ORGANIZATION], 111 people are going to the streets [ORGANIZATION]. So in combining that,  And I like what [ORGANIZATION] is doing.",portland
10_12_2016,houseless,"The neighbors are talking to the houseless community, seeing what they can do to better that neighborhood. And I think that's what needs to be done with this grant, with this proposal, that you need to combine and have real faces meet real people and say, hey, I'm houseless. but I'm not what you think I am.",portland
10_12_2016,houseless,"So if you've got these successful houseless people outreaching and letting people know they're successful and what it took for them to get successful, I think, you know, I believe I know this will be a better city. Thank you. Questions for this great panel?",portland
10_12_2016,homeless,"uh... i just wanna say if you if you're not sure in case you might not be here then that uh...  This is a little tangential, but stick with me. DATE0, I was at [ORGANIZATION], and there were 150 people in the room, and they were advocates and homeless folks and architects and big thinkers about housing.",portland
10_12_2016,homelessness,"We'll come up with strategies that even the biggest and most focused effort the city and the county have ever had on housing and homelessness will be improved effectively.  by the fact that those kinds of ideas and innovations will come to us. So it was just, you know, I believed in this before, but frankly being in that room with those folks is like, oh, yeah, this is going to work.",portland
10_12_2016,homeless,"Okay. And at this point, we actually are already overextended in terms of our ongoing commitments because [ORGANIZATION] we're spending $11.5 million of ongoing money on homeless services, and we've made a commitment to spend $15 million a year on homeless services. So we're $3.5 million in the hole.",portland
10_12_2016,housing crisis,"My first concern is how much of the $350,000 will be used to alleviate the sufferings of those most impacted by the housing crisis, versus how much will be spent on overhead among the participating agencies? Why is [ORGANIZATION] undertaking this, despite the city budget office analysis advising that there are already established outreach and public engagement efforts, primarily facilitated through ORG1? My second concern is, will the community engagement be meaningful, inclusive, and equitable?",portland
10_12_2016,unhoused,"I see no mention of neighbor engagement in the plan, yet the neighbors are the ones who will be expected to coexist peaceably and equitably. Neighbors are everyone who contribute to the fabric of the community. In [ORGANIZATION], our neighbors are housed and unhoused.",portland
10_12_2016,unhoused,"The city chose to see the struggle of the diverse housed and the diverse unhoused as separate struggles. Policies seem to be directed at divide and conquer, where the diverse poor, working poor, and working class housed will pivot against the diverse poor and working poor unhoused to everyone's detriment. My third concern is, will the community be respectfully listened to and heard, or will the engagement remain lip service and participation remain tokenized?  [ORGANIZATION]'s experience [LOCATION] has been that, whether housed or unhoused, concerns were ignored or dismissed if they didn't match the city's agenda.",portland
10_12_2016,unhoused,"No matter who protested, housed or unhoused, or about what, human rights, health, safety, safe space, quiet enjoyment, the message was clear. They don't really care about us. When a [ORGANIZATION] resident dared to suggest that wealthier neighborhoods should also bear the responsibility for caring for the unhoused, a city employee used a misogynistic, oppressive epithet to describe him on social media, and the city has yet to issue an apology.",portland
10_12_2016,homeless,"This was exactly the case with me, but for my own life and the safety of my kids, I left all the same. Because I had to leave the home to escape him, I was immediately homeless and had no means of providing for us. The best solution available to me for the first problem was to seek out space in a shelter.",portland

But the first cousin is the struggles we've had in the past when we've talked about putting new transportation lines in different parts of the city, and how do we create incentives for affordable housing?

11_05_2015,affordable housing,"The financial analysis recommendations both recommended kind of starting with residential and then having the commercial or the new commercial come in on the back end, but also coordinating infrastructure and development so that we're not getting ahead of the game in terms of our infrastructure investments as a city. So just to go over a little bit in terms of the affordable housing approach, we heard a lot from council as well as [ORGANIZATION] about ORG1 working with ORG2 to make sure that we were targeting the 30% figure that is the goal of the [PERSON] plan. And so what came before council DATE0 as part of the DATE1 set-aside policy recommendations was for [ORGANIZATION] to allocate $20 million –  towards affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] urban renewal area, with a significant portion of that serving to acquire rights...  for [ORGANIZATION] to acquire rights within the development of the postal site.",portland
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"for [ORGANIZATION] to develop affordable housing.

That's something we'd love to see going forward, as well as transparency around not just the dollar amounts but the units, the number of units, who they'll serve, as Commissioner [PERSON] was highlighting a moment ago, and what the plan is.

11_05_2015,affordable housing,i'm happy to answer any questions well i guess uh since you mentioned institutional investors [ORGANIZATION] i guess i just wanted to ask you i feel that a lot of the institutional investors from out of state have no interest in doing affordable housing that's been my experience and  to date with the vast majority of ones I've had outreach with. So what do we do to change that?,portland
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"But where it's our property, surely we can require that. You know, you don't get to develop here unless, and I would suggest maybe you don't even get to develop here unless you're going to do some affordable housing somewhere else as well, or at least do a mixed use or a mixed income level. Yeah, no, I think, you know, I think the policies we passed [ORGANIZATION], you know, certainly create that floor.",portland
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"And when a number of the developers were interviewed recently in a newspaper article, they cited generally red tape and bureaucracy as the impediments to using that program. The irony is you just mentioned a program in [ORGANIZATION] where they are mandated to provide affordable housing. It's not an incentive plan.",portland
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"So what would it take to get the development community, in your judgment, to join the city in seeking a lifting of the preemption on inclusionary zoning so we can mandate out-of-state developers to do the right thing? First off, I'd say that my expertise as a commercial real estate broker is in office. So asking me about residential unit  in particular affordable housing, which is very complex and typically takes subsidizing, is probably not my Arab expertise.",portland
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"It ought to be our jobs. as for the affordable housing i would be a big advocate of putting that on the private sector and i would look for outcomes from that and i'd love to see it mixed in with the balance of the project as opposed to taking a block for affordable housing and five blocks for private sector work as for the value uh based on what i've been uh the information has been shared with me based upon what i understand that the zoning is uh contemplated to be put on this i think after [ORGANIZATION] and the city does their work with entitlements in [STREET]  assuming it's the FAR that comes off the streets and parks, goes onto the developable land, assuming that we take this to market in a very competitive, brokered fashion to get the highest value possible, and net of the public improvements, including affordable housing, so straight market rate stuff, my estimate after the work is done that this on the low end is going to be worth $135 million worth of dirt, and on the high end $177 million worth of dirt.",portland
11_05_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"[STREET] warriors um you know the the homeless certainly that's an issue drugs and alcohol are an issue chronic homeless people are an issue but the big issue is the vagrancy and the young toughs so um  When you just attached a value, I think you said $130 to $135 million. You said net of affordable housing.",portland
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"So, [ORGANIZATION], with the action we took recently kicking –  urban renewal, the percentage of urban renewal money for affordable housing of 45%. Some have argued that's hastening the demise of [ORGANIZATION] as an economic development agency because we're choking off some resources that they need to do their job. Well, we all agree that if [ORGANIZATION]s can be successful in the long term, we have to find a new model for them to generate revenue.",portland
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"I think it's just some of the [STREET] we do business around here. So the First Amendment to the resolution simply reflects [ORGANIZATION] goal that we agreed on [ORGANIZATION] and has been said here is already,  Part of the purpose there of that is to have 30% of the housing be affordable to 0% to 80% median family income, and that's the amendment to the resolution. And then the amendment to the [ORGANIZATION] really just adds language that reflects the memo that was developed between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], which I have here as well,  and would include that memo as an attachment to make for a compact legislative history, and just simply says that [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] will fulfill all their obligations with respect to affordable housing, as agreed to by council in [LOCATION].",portland
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"but i think as we heard i think we all agree we want to see sort of some mixed income development here so i think this really speaks aspirationally to you know we also want to include if we can through private resources or through our multi-program uh units that serve that 60 to 80 percent as well  I support the central city goal, and I share the point that you made and [ORGANIZATION] made about mixed income development, because sometimes that's the strongest development, where we blend the deeply affordable housing with middle-income housing, and everyone wins. The only thing I – and I guess I'm a little gun-shy because of FAC0.",portland
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"I don't want this to be interpreted as saying that –  that somehow we don't invest the first dollar into where the greatest need is. And the first dollars and the money that we're generating in this area, if we adopt the resolution before us,  will be set aside money for deeply affordable housing. So I might want to ask [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON2, if they're still here, to come up and respond to this about how this would be administered if we adopt these amendments.",portland
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"And the [ORGANIZATION] has done a comprehensive analysis of this and said that he's satisfied that this financing mechanism is prudent. And the third is that –  we have a chance in this development to make another significant contribution towards affordable housing and do it the right [STREET], which is at the front end with binding commitments, learning from our experience in [ORGANIZATION]. So for those reasons, and then just an extra credit one for me, is that if we are serious about [ORGANIZATION] moving beyond [ORGANIZATION] as a funding source, and if we want [ORGANIZATION] to play a long-term role in economic development,  we are going to have to develop a new model for them to be successful.",portland
11_05_2015,affordable housing,"But I don't think we really had sort of the economic engine to really see something happen or the vacancy rates, both residential and commercial, being at historic lows that just tell us that development is primed. And particularly on the affordable housing, when we can prime the pumps with further commitment of public resources to do that. So I really do think it's a question of having the right leadership and being in the right time and the right [STREET].",portland

So, Commissioners, the city has been approached by [ORGANIZATION], Director of [ORGANIZATION], a provider of transitional housing for families experiencing homelessness.

People have secured jobs, started small businesses, left domestic violence relationships.  and sought recovery from addiction and mental health disorders through their work at the village. We at [ORGANIZATION] are actively pursuing additional alternative shelters like FAC0 and ORG1, but we believe that the system development charges are prohibitive, and applying for individual waivers really impedes our ability to be nimble and flexible and to start new sites.",portland

10_18_2017,homelessness,"Thank you so much for having me here [ORGANIZATION]. Since I became chair of [ORGANIZATION], we've been working together, the city and the county, to build a more rational and robust response to homelessness. Step one was pulling everyone together through a home for everyone, setting big goals and aligning our resources around a simple strategy, prevention, housing, and shelter.",portland
10_18_2017,homelessness,"Thank you. Step two was making that partnership real with [ORGANIZATION], bringing all of our resources under one roof, giving us the ability to respond to the forces that [STREET] homelessness in real time. And we're here to talk [ORGANIZATION] about what I see as the third step, a big commitment to supportive housing, which takes what we've learned in this [LOCATION]'s point-in-time count and what we're learning in our efforts to reform our public safety system,  and what we've been learning during the health care reform and putting it all into practice.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,We know that a jail bed or the waiting room of an emergency room are not the places to overcome these challenges. People need a home. But the reality is that affordable housing doesn't always come with these services.,portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"Supportive housing is affordable housing that has the intensive services that people need to stay healthy and stable and successfully housed. And throughout our health care system, our mental health care system, and throughout public safety system, we're paying for apartments just like these. But we need more.",portland
10_18_2017,homeless,"Thank you. Thank you. Mayor, Commissioners, [ORGANIZATION], Director of [ORGANIZATION], thanks for the opportunity to be here in support of this important effort.",portland
10_18_2017,homelessness,"In some cases, this supportive housing looks like [ORGANIZATION] own FAC0, a permanent supportive housing community that was designed and is staffed with appropriate property management and resident services to serve some of the most vulnerable people in our community coming out of homelessness with a home. utilizing principles of harm reduction and housing first. We're fortunate [ORGANIZATION] that we're joined by a colleague of mine who in a bit will share far more eloquently than I can what that means in real terms.",portland
10_18_2017,homelessness,"What we are lacking in is the necessary scale. We have a lot of experience to build on, and partners across the systems that touch people in homelessness agree that now is the time to lean into this effort. We need to expand and we need to keep learning, and we need to focus on ensuring that as we build on our current efforts, we continue to make sure that what we're doing makes real our commitment to address the persistent racial disparities that exist in homelessness in our community.",portland
10_18_2017,homeless,"So I've experienced homeless at a really young age. Okay. My family, my dad, and my two brothers, we lived in the back of our station wagon in the ninth grade behind my high school.",portland
10_18_2017,homelessness,This led to me later on in my life to [ORGANIZATION] of incarcerations due to my addiction and [ORGANIZATION] homelessness. It's been a rough [STREET]. Been in and out of treatment centers.,portland
10_18_2017,homeless,"Now I'm a taxpayer, and I would like nothing more than my tax dollars to go toward more housing opportunities like I have got. I just want to close by saying one more quote. This one's by [ORGANIZATION], and she says, Homeless shelters, human hunger, and suffering have become normalized in the richest nation on earth.",portland
10_18_2017,homelessness,"Yeah, probably. So I'm genuinely excited to be here. There's been so much important work happening DATE0 around housing and homelessness, but [LOCATION] is really a unique day.",portland
10_18_2017,homeless; homelessness,"We've done a lot of important work over [ORGANIZATION] since launching [ORGANIZATION] to create more opportunities for people experiencing homelessness, but I don't think there is an effort that's going to prove to be more important to the success of our work than what we're proposing to launch [LOCATION]. We are preventing, placing, retaining, and sheltering more people DATE2 than at any time. Over 29,000 of our neighbors received assistance just through the programs funded with local, city, and county homeless program funding [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_18_2017,homeless; homelessness,"We're piloting new interventions, and we're expanding the ones that work. But we're continuing to lose ground with one of the most vulnerable populations on our streets, those who are chronically homeless, people who have been homeless a long time and are struggling with one or more serious disabilities. The increase in chronic homelessness accounted for the vast majority of the overall increase in homelessness in the last point-in-time count.",portland
10_18_2017,homelessness,"No other population group grew faster. DATE0 we're talking about an intervention, often the only intervention, that works to end someone's chronic homelessness. Supportive housing.",portland
10_18_2017,homelessness,"Supportive housing was an innovation in [ORGANIZATION] when we launched the first [LOCATION] plan to end homelessness. DATE2, there are literally volumes of research documenting not just that supportive housing works for those who benefit from it, but that it is the most cost-effective intervention we can make. We've studied it locally through an evaluation of FAC0 and more recently a study by [ORGANIZATION] of different types of supportive housing in the community.",portland
10_18_2017,homeless,"Across the board, what we learned from the research is what we would expect. Even the most chronically homeless individuals start to thrive when they get into supportive housing. They're able to retain that housing long term, and they use far fewer high-cost crisis resources.",portland
10_18_2017,homeless,"For sharing your story. I know how nerve-wracking it is to come to this table and say anything, let alone something so personal. And it's just vitally important that we hear these stories and that the public hears these stories because I think that there is a –  pervasive belief that people who are chronically homeless, people who are experiencing mental illness or addiction, are lost causes, and you are proof that human beings aren't lost causes.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,You're going to take that $[ADDRESS] to make affordable housing more acceptable. And they are not connected properly.,portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"If you're on the [STREET] with no money and you're a drug addict, you have nothing to do with affordable housing. Nothing. You need someone to help.",portland
10_18_2017,homelessness,"We are your partners in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] on the issues of homelessness and housing, and I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to urge your support for this resolution and to say thank you. Thank you for prioritizing permanent supportive housing [ORGANIZATION] with this resolution. and in the bond framework that you adopted [LOCATION].",portland
10_18_2017,homelessness,"It's a critical component to any city's strategy in addressing homelessness, especially the issue of chronic homelessness, and is a proven national best practice. So I'm pleased to see us moving forward. As you all know, and as we as providers know,  Permanent supportive housing is one of the most difficult types of housing to create.",portland
10_18_2017,homelessness,"So I applaud you for understanding that. One specific piece I want to underline that often gets left out of our public dialogue around homelessness are the issues of families experiencing homelessness, and in particular the need of families with children for permanent supportive housing. Our public dialogue, especially recently around homelessness, has focused heavily on what the community sees in the streets.",portland
10_18_2017,homeless; homelessness,"And that's a reasonable [STREET] to focus because that's what we see [ORGANIZATION]. At [ORGANIZATION], we operate a no-turnaway shelter for families experiencing homelessness. And because of that and because of the [STREET] that the homeless family system works, right now our community isn't typically not seeing kids and their parents waking up in tents and trailers and heading to school in the morning because they all have a [STREET] to sleep at [TIME], and that's in the shelter.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"They all need affordable housing, but the specific type of housing we're prioritizing here  often it's not the family population that folks are thinking of. So I want to encourage us as we move forward to stay focused and do the work to find out how big the need is among the family population or we're not going to solve that problem. Thank you.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"But at [DATE], we need funding. Commissioner [PERSON], affordable housing bond, that's called needing funding, understanding that up front and then beginning to create the supportive permanent housing. Now, with that in mind, we can calculate out to $2,000 from...",portland

10_18_2017,homeless,"So people do become homeless in mass amounts all the time. So I think what we have here, along with this and many other things, we may want to start to consider emergency relief efforts. And what that includes is the same thing we do after Katrina or anything else, except with a twist.",portland
10_18_2017,homeless,Okay. We'll have homeless people there with the people that are healthy. We'll have all the services there.,portland
10_18_2017,housing crisis,"But it's extremely counterproductive for community members to come here and spread misinformation and misunderstanding in the public space. I have confidence that most of you who are in the chambers [ORGANIZATION] understand that some of the things that were said were just a misrepresentation of reality. But I'm concerned for people listening and watching in the community that they may think that we think creating 2,000 units is going to solve our housing crisis.",portland
10_18_2017,housing crisis,"And it's obviously not. So just to be clear, this is one essential piece of a multifaceted solution to alleviating and eventually solving our housing crisis. And it is targeted to a specific population of individuals experiencing mental illness, drug addiction, significant disability, or some combination thereof.",portland
10_18_2017,homeless,"Not all...  2,000 to 4,000 people who are homeless or living in temporary shelter require permanent supportive housing. Many of them have simply been displaced from, economically displaced from their housing. So we are not building permanently supportive housing for those people.",portland
10_18_2017,housing crisis,"We're doing other things like increasing tenant protections,  our inclusionary zoning plan, building housing through our housing bond, our residential infill program, pausing enforcement on tiny homes and RVs, and working with our state and federal delegations on finding more funding and more solutions for what is a national housing crisis. Now for my closing statements. I'm sincerely grateful to serve alongside colleagues who are committed to improving the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in our city.",portland
10_18_2017,homeless,"I also want to give a special warm thank you to [ORGANIZATION], who I've really enjoyed working with [ORGANIZATION], and all of the staff at [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] for being the stewards of these bold visions and for being so capable and ready for whatever challenges we throw their [STREET]. Because of them and the other conveners listed in the resolution, I have great hope that not only will we accomplish these goals, but we will have a clear path to doing even more. I'm very pleased to vote aye.",portland
10_18_2017,homelessness,"And ultimately, I believe people in this city are compassionate and they want to be able to get their arms around something.

10_18_2017,affordable housing,Excellent. Direct ORG0 to adopt an affordable housing green building policy for new construction and rehabilitation. Now.,portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"When we were created DATE0 out of the housing functions of  now [ORGANIZATION], then [PERSON], and ORG2, we referenced the [PERSON] policy, which had been previously, and still to [DATE], to essentially use LEED Gold, Leadership in Environmental and Energy Development Standards. Wow. Actually, originally it was a completely separate policy from the policy for city facilities, and it was just for affordable housing.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"This happened before. So I think you know the background. There was a policy that was special for affordable housing over time, and after [ORGANIZATION] was formed, we just kind of fell back on [ORGANIZATION]'s policy, which eventually matched the city's.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"As [ORGANIZATION] said, it's applicable to 20 units or more, affordable housing only, and 10% funding from [ORGANIZATION] or owned by us. And so you know what the big objectives are to improve tenant health and meet our climate action plan and environmental stewardship and all of that, which I can't see. But the practical objective and what we were really going after was to carve out, if you will, from ORG1 and ORG2, the bigger programs which have many, many measures that you can choose from to get all your points, to carve out the measures that had the most benefit on multifamily housing, and to really focus on that and get our points for those measures.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"It's fine. So grab it so we can get it signed. We have been watching where our money is going on our affordable housing projects and started to feel like it was getting very expensive to continue to do [ORGANIZATION], and we weren't sure what we were getting for that.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"I mean, I think with climate change happening and it seems like the humane thing to require, I've gone to enough groundbreaking or ribbon cuttings of our affordable housing projects  facilities in [ORGANIZATION] to realize how hot these places are for the individuals who are going to end up living in them. Currently, as a fallback, most of our projects are using portable units that plug into a window panel so that we can get to the units that are overheating, which are usually the west side and the top. We don't often need it on the north side, on the bottom.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"Over DATE0 I've been doing affordable housing, I've witnessed a growing awareness and implementation of sustainable building practices. Features that were aspirational [LOCATION] are now standard practice, and it's time for a policy that looks forward from here and gently raises the bar. [ORGANIZATION] champions the [ORGANIZATION] plan to progressively achieve carbon-neutral buildings by the year [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"I'm [PERSON], the Director of Innovation at [ORGANIZATION], and I'm here on behalf of [ORGANIZATION] to...  I voice my support for ORG2's efforts to create a streamlined and vital green building policy, a policy that should reduce the demands of green certification while ensuring that the deep benefits of green building are included in [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing moving forward. Thank you. I believe [PERSON] should be commended for focusing on energy efficiency and air quality as the core measures of green building that benefit our community and the residents of the buildings.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"So now that you have that background that [ORGANIZATION] just provided to you, we'd like to report on some of the work we did in response to Commissioner [PERSON]'s request related to the [ORGANIZATION].  [ORGANIZATION]. So just briefly for those of you who are new to city council, we started the central city planning process by developing some overall policy guidance and  and then three high-level plans for different central city geographies, and those are listed on the screen before you. Each of these groups had a committee that advised [ORGANIZATION] staff, and the committees were comprised of people who had some sort of stake in the outcome, like advocates for affordable housing, neighborhood interests, environmental interests, and, of course, property owners, business owners, and people who work in the area.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"We did a bonus and transfer study that started our work on prioritizing the affordable housing bonus. And those materials and...  implementation strategies developed as part of that were not part of any of the quadrant planning work committees. So once all the processes that I just described were complete, staff began to integrate it into an early version of [ORGANIZATION] draft that you have before you.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"So we have the real possibility of getting a mix of affordable housing into the new development. You know, the baseline sort of things that we get from redevelopment and reinvestment, especially in a situation like this, seemed like they offer a good deal of public value as well as real estate value. Can I touch on another area of concern?",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"So the only – and that determines the number of square feet that could be built on the piece of land. The only addition to that we are proposing is to increase it to five to one, and mostly that's so that we have a better shot at getting more of the affordable housing. And five to one, an additional one-to-one floor area ratio on that site is about 370,000 square feet of development.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,Aren't we changing the bonuses so it's only bonuses for affordable housing? The main bonus is for affordable housing? That's right.,portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"That's correct. So in this area with a base height of 50, if they wanted to go above 50, it's bonus height, and they would have the affordable housing build it on site or pay into the fund. There's also the option for historic preservation, but your first bonus is affordable housing.",portland
10_18_2017,affordable housing,"Special attention will be given to opportunities to include more affordable housing, promote economic development and redevelopment, implement multimodal transportation improvements, including FAC0, which actually uses FAC1, the new bridge, and provide additional open space opportunities under an overall equity strategy for city-led investments in the area. This is in your packet.  or that would be one of the lead implementers of this action item. So that is an amendment that is being proposed by the commissioner.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"So [ORGANIZATION], I'm happy to announce that the cities of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], have agreed to work together to promote affordable housing, business stabilization, and other development in the corridor in conjunction with light rail, something that will truly move us forward in terms of livability and equity. Now I'd like to invite [PERSON] from ORG2 and PERSON1, [ORGANIZATION]'s General Manager, to provide some opening remarks before the staff presentation. Welcome.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"We are committed, as obviously the city is as well, to ensuring that we can preserve and expand upon that supply as development occurs in the future with this transit investment. The city's and our partnership in developing an equitable development strategy and housing strategy is critical to avoiding the displacement that has occurred in past public investments for transportation purposes. On [ORGANIZATION], the voters of our region will have an opportunity to support the regional affordable housing bond, and [ORGANIZATION] is committed to ensuring that the appropriate proportion of those funds are spent on maintaining and increasing the supply of affordable housing in this corridor.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"One of the indications of the continued success of the partnerships is the [ORGANIZATION] on affordable housing, an important cornerstone. This represents extensive collaboration among your bureaus, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], to help address the rising housing costs in this region and the complexities that come with it. This agreement was born out of the inclusive work that [ORGANIZATION] facilitated to advance an equitable housing strategy.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"So the [ORGANIZATION] spells out a process by which there's an opportunity for cities to acquire some of that land to facilitate affordable housing as the project wraps up. City agencies are also exploring if there are ways that we can acquire property and make that land available to [ORGANIZATION] as part of our contribution to the project, also facilitating housing eventually. Next slide.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"As we know with our looking at affordable housing transportation choices and what one has to pay to maintain a car really affect the funds that people have to spend on their [DATE] lives. So finding a [STREET] without a tunnel to connect this light rail project to [ORGANIZATION] and provide a meaningful opportunity for students, administrators, and staff to get to the college is very important to us. So the steering committee has asked us to look at some bus shuttle options.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"So I'll just say. So here's some information on historic resources, a lot of work left to do. [DATE], you'll be asked to accept, adopt the preferred alignment, and direct the project team through [ORGANIZATION] to create a conceptual design report, address issues raised, implement the Ross Island Bridgehead process outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding, tell us to work on developing the local match financing strategy, and have concurrent reports on affordable housing and our progress toward meeting those goals.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"Our latest surveys show that we have 30% of our students using public transit as their primary mode of travel. With the proposed light rail extension, we anticipate that figure increasing, not only in student ridership, but for our staff as well. Additionally, we appreciate the inclusion of an affordable housing strategy in the corridor planning.",portland
11_01_2018,homelessness; housing insecurity,Recent studies have shown that about half of community college students experience housing insecurity and 13 to 14 percent experience homelessness. The equitable housing strategy is an opportunity to meet the basic needs of our students and their families so they can better focus on their academic success. [ORGANIZATION] does realize that there are some segments of the light rail alignment that are not yet confirmed.,portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"Nearly $3 billion for infrastructure plus another $1.5 billion to subsidize affordable housing, some of which will likely be property taken and removed from the tax rolls. The proposed bond measures that in part rely upon residential property taxes to pay off the bonds will unjustly increase the cost of housing for the entire region. The FAC0 line was paid for with [ORGANIZATION] freeway dollars.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"How does this support land use vision? Okay. [ORGANIZATION] is being given in outer [ORGANIZATION] not to the land use development and affordable housing, but on expanded parking on FAC0 at the expense of the quiet neighborhood, which is far southwest.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"Probably by the time this is built, $300 million worth of parking being built in this project, which will last for a long time. To compare that, the current [ORGANIZATION] bond is spending about $65 million to acquire naturally occurring affordable housing near transit. So this project is significant.  expecting to spend somewhere between three and five times the amount of money on parking as we're spending to acquire affordable housing.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"This could be 12 to 1,700 built or acquired affordable housing units near this corridor filled with 3,000 plus maybe 3,600 people or more who would ride transit quite regularly if they  It makes much better sense, I think, to build housing, a lot more housing near this transit corridor line than to build parking. We can bring people into the transit centers with better bus service, dedicated bus lanes, et cetera. And I want to really just...  strike that we should really think about when this will come online and not where we are [ORGANIZATION].",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"There's lack of affordable housing close to jobs. This is just to say I don't believe that increasing ridership on mass transit is a lost cause. I think  because we have failed to mitigate displacement and because we haven't developed housing strategies alongside these transit projects, we have seen decreased ridership.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"So can only imagine how bad it's gotten since then. I've been living in the city since then, so. I strongly support a regional agreement to secure land for affordable housing along this route, which is what the [ORGANIZATION] does.",portland
11_01_2018,affordable housing,"been very patient and worked your [STREET] through and been willing to compromise. And that's what we're talking about for this project is let's not compromise where we absolutely need to hold firm, like in affordable housing, like in locally owned businesses. I think in like not providing park and ride spaces for people who don't live in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
09_29_2016,affordable housing,"Very interesting analysis of the issue about affordable housing and trees, which you also just showed us. Thank you. Great.",portland
11_21_2019,homelessness,It's a compassionate and I believe a better [STREET] to respond to incidents involving the city's homelessness and those experiencing mental health crises in our community. My team has spent a considerable amount of time brainstorming and working on such programs behind the scenes on programs including this.,portland
11_21_2019,unhoused,"When the [ORGANIZATION] published the report that 52% of all arrests affected unhoused people, while that number was a brutal number for us all to grapple with, it also felt very true to what we see [ORGANIZATION] in [STREET] routes. unhoused people, their bodies are inscribed with the trauma of living on the streets. And they are, in a sense, always contending with not being in the right space.",portland
11_21_2019,homelessness,"It's almost like as a society, we're pushing people further and further into poverty and homelessness. Folks that are in law enforcement, their mission is about enforcing the law. Their mission is about dealing with crimes.",portland
11_21_2019,homeless,We need to make sure that people who are homeless are encountering people whose mission is different than that. Their mission is public health. Their mission is making sure that everyone is thriving as much as humanly possible.,portland
11_21_2019,homeless,"And if the police need to be involved, they can be caught. We do have a mental health crisis that's going berserk in this city. Our homeless population tend to have a lack of trust for police response now.",portland
11_21_2019,housing crisis,"These calls that relate to somebody who is just struggling often don't require a police officer or a fire engine to come, but if we don't have anything else, that's who has to come. As important as [ORGANIZATION] is in terms of ensuring that we're sending the right first responder to the appropriate situation,  It won't address the housing crisis unless we're also expanding the available resources for the folks who are being engaged. Our ability to really capitalize on the benefits of that engagement depends on there being resources available, and that means housing.",portland
11_21_2019,homelessness,We in public safety know the system is broken. Criminalizing mental health and homelessness is not the solution. We have been building out a community health assessment team that looks at high utilizers and tries to pair them with the appropriate resources.,portland

11_21_2019,unhoused,"I just came from a pizza party because the vendors are celebrating the fact that we got this far. They've been so involved in this the whole [STREET] from really dreaming up the...  the plan talking to us about these ideas for a long time, being involved in the campaign, being involved in doing surveys of other unhoused people, and even judging the logo contest. So a number of them are here, probably in the balcony because a pizza party went long, and some of our staff are here too.",portland
11_21_2019,unhoused,"And this work really is animated, or this perspective is animated, our work from [ORGANIZATION] through our newspaper and our reporting. But also because all of us at [ORGANIZATION] spend so much time together, and we have about 170 vendors who, about half of whom are unhoused. We all share the same coffee pot, so we share a lot of stories, we share a lot of awareness of each other's lives.",portland
11_21_2019,unhoused,"So just briefly, I had the privilege of serving on the community engagement work group, co-chairing it with [ORGANIZATION], who works on Commissioner [PERSON]'s staff. And we did a number of things. We really put forward the idea that we wanted people who are unhoused to be a part of the development of this pilot, and we wanted to figure out how that could be possible.",portland
11_21_2019,unhoused,"So we set up a number of listening sessions. First and foremost was the idea that  we all needed to go to where people who are unhoused are at, that we too often expect them to come into spaces that they aren't usually coming into. So we went to [ORGANIZATION].",portland
11_21_2019,homelessness,"So the next phase of the community outreach was to conduct a survey. And that was done with [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] who's following up on the evaluation side also. And we conducted that with ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], and [ORGANIZATION].",portland
11_21_2019,homelessness,And FAC0 vendors went out with [ORGANIZATION] students and other community members. Each survey team had at least one person who had experienced homelessness or was currently experiencing homelessness. And they went out and surveyed people on trails and squats and camps and shelters to find out what people wanted in FAC1 response.,portland

A lot of folks are saying they just feel like people dial FAC0 a little too easily. And number eight, treat people with compassion and dignity.",portland
11_21_2019,unhoused,"Just the finally we also helped hold a logo contest and one of the things that we were able to do with the logo contest was have boxes depository boxes at [ORGANIZATION] as well as at [STREET] roots and Commissioner [PERSON]'s office so that they were in a number of places where people who are unhoused could enter the contest and  And again, like the survey experience, we were really pleased to have this be a situation where unhoused folks were sitting alongside housed folks to do the judging. We had three FAC0 vendors with staff from Mayor [PERSON]'s office and from your office, Commissioner [PERSON]. And I think one of the things that was really powerful about that process was the fact that  that people in the community were able to try to draw what I think of as a kind of civic imagination around this.",portland
11_21_2019,homeless,"One person really drew a lot about mental health and supporting LGBTQ people and just this kind of compassionate illustration. And another person made a beautiful drawing and then said she dedicated it to her mother who, in [ORGANIZATION], was homeless and died on our streets. And I think I'll end it there because that is something that underlies all of this.",portland
11_21_2019,unhoused,"The fact that we do know too many people die on our streets and the more we can provide people hope and we can, you know, reduce the amount of trauma they experience, the more we can contribute to a healthier [STREET] for unhoused people. Thank you very much. Thanks, [ORGANIZATION].",portland
11_21_2019,unhoused,"We need to understand how it's operating and what changes and adaptations are necessary along the [STREET] to make sure it's working for unhoused individuals, for the ORG0 team, and for the community. Commissioner [PERSON] expressed her dedication to making sure the pilot was evaluated and informed by data when I met her at the listening sessions in [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON1 invited us to co-develop a survey methodology and report highlighting the critical perspectives of unhoused individuals.",portland
11_21_2019,homelessness,"This gives us a great deal of confidence that the proposed pilot is not only what key stakeholders want and need, but also what will be successful. [ORGANIZATION] will work closely with [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner [PERSON]'s office, and many others throughout the pilot program to conduct an ongoing evaluation. We are finalizing our primary performance measures and we welcome feedback and recommendations.",portland
11_21_2019,unhoused,"In addition to these quantitative outcomes, it's also vital that we assess the experiences of unhoused individuals who are affected by [ORGANIZATION]. At this point, we can go back to the video. Thank you.",portland
11_21_2019,homelessness,"We will then produce a [ORGANIZATION] pilot review summarizing all of the outcomes and provide formal recommendations for modifying the program and scaling up citywide. Throughout this entire process, we will continue working as we began, in close collaboration with key stakeholders representing the needs and experiences of those who will be most impacted by [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] is honored to be a part of this innovative, community-centered pilot program, and we thank you for the opportunity.",portland
11_21_2019,houseless,"And a recommendation for a station downtown in the core, but that's where all the resources are. We also know that we have vulnerable populations and houseless out in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. And so we wanted to see within the pilot program what the turnaround would be and how effective the pilot would be when you're,  further removed from resources.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"So, this program is desperately needed and has been for [ORGANIZATION]. The federal government is chronically underfunding affordable housing, mental health care, and addiction services. And the state of [ORGANIZATION], in particular, is failing individuals experiencing mental health and addiction issues with some of the lowest levels of service in the nation.",portland
11_21_2019,homelessness; housing crisis,"Therefore, the city of [ORGANIZATION] is also struggling. We're in [ORGANIZATION] of a housing crisis, and while it's largely driven by unaffordability of housing, when it comes to those experiencing chronic homelessness, it's also a mental health and addiction crisis. This is a pilot program, but it's already a proven response, and I have the utmost confidence that [LOCATION] we're going to be back here talking about expanding it and how we're going to find the funding.",portland
11_21_2019,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] mental health specialist [PERSON] is currently conducting a beta test of mental health first aid training with city staff and hopefully [ORGANIZATION] we're going to be able to  [PERSON] that citywide and then eventually offer it broadly to community members. So we have a network of [ORGANIZATION] members across the entire city who are more prepared to respond to people in crisis and who know what what to do, so I want to offer the support of my office and [PERSON] if there's any interest in connecting with other  those existing resources and building capacity in our communities and protect particularly the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. Being homeless is not a crime.",portland
11_21_2019,homeless,"And we'll have to resolve those bumps in the [STREET] ahead. And I also acknowledge this is not a panacea.  for the homeless crisis that we're seeing on our streets. And I want to always remind ourselves that this is yet one more evolution, one more important step in providing services that we need to provide in the community, but it is not in and of itself a sufficient action.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"The amendment would add a home ownership option to this development bonus. And one reason why we're grouping these together is because there are three pieces that work together for the same thing. Basically, there's a zoning code amendment that references Title 30, which is our affordable housing title.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"So affordable at 80% would be what, about $75,000 that somebody would have to make before they would qualify for affordable housing option? Those are good questions. I am deferring to [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION].",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"PERSON0 I [ORGANIZATION] mayor, um, I Didn't object so I vote no PERSON2 The amendments are adopted. Next up is Amendment 2, which amends the affordable housing parking exemption.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"This is, this amendment would be exempting an existing affordable housing  I'm sorry, expanding an affordable housing exemption for parking. Currently, if you're within 500 feet of frequent service transit lines, that's about one-tenth of a mile. Projects that include affordable units through the inclusionary housing program are exempt from providing parking and  The intent of this amendment is the same reason why we have that exemption, which is to help reduce costs associated with providing parking as part of compact development to really support the ability to get housing projects that include affordable units.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"When you took parking out, inclusionary housing developments actually did pencil and actually became fairly attractive to do. So what we found is whether or not you're requiring parking definitely plays into the feasibility of projects that include affordable units. Basically, what this amendment would do would be to apply the frequent service transit affordable housing parking exemption to any affordable housing projects citywide in those zones.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"but it does not make the presumption that every housing project would have it, but when parking is provided, the thinking is that it should support electric vehicles, but that project hasn't really envisioned a future where we anticipate that everyone will have that. Your economic analysis showed that on the margin, the parking requirement could be the difference between whether an affordable housing project is viable or not, is that correct? Yes, it is.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"And also remember that many of these buildings are the naturally occurring affordable housing. These are some of the big old housing that's already been subdivided into smaller units. And so to provide an incentive to get rid of those and then something, whatever's going to go in is going to be more expensive, doesn't seem prudent either.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"those properties would not be able to use development bonuses  The [STREET] the regulations written is that in the inner neighborhoods You would not have to go through a special review procedure because we have a very well tightly knit transit system in those areas, but there are more gaps in the [ORGANIZATION] system in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and they would need to document that they're within that walking distance So even if most projects could you know? Use the bonus there'd be more process involved with documentation Something to consider too is most of the bonuses are for affordable housing up to now.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"We haven't had a big run for inclusionary housing bonuses so at least up to now we haven't had a problem of affordable housing projects using bonuses and  broadly in the city. So up to now it has not been a huge problem. So with that, staff does believe given the placement of the mixed-use and multi-dwelling zoning close to transit, we don't support additional process or an amendment that would require that the documentation of being within that distance.  Very good.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you for that. I will say, I guess the question is, do we anticipate public transit improvements taking [STREET] while we're building affordable housing? Since most of the building will take [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION], I can tell you that there's a lot of people that don't live within a thousand feet of public transit.",portland
11_21_2019,housing crisis,"I don't understand. If we believe that we are in a housing crisis, it seems to me we need to find ways to increase the amount  workforce and lower-income housing not put restrictions and limitations on the ability to build it. Because we're also in a climate crisis and we need to stop people from driving.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"Okay. All right, well the intent of this amendment is really to facilitate transfer opportunities from sites and the situations where you could transfer development opportunity is where a site is preserving historic buildings and there's some special provisions for seismic upgrade transfers and also you can transfer development rights for where you're preserving existing affordable housing or where you're preserving large trees. Currently, in [ORGANIZATION] recommended draft, transfers are only allowed between sites in the same type of zone.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"The intent was really to prioritize affordable housing as to what gives you greater scale. So there are some inherent limits on how much transfer you could receive, and this amendment would make it easier to find spots where it could be useful to receive some additional scale. Thank you.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. So the [ORGANIZATION] doesn't tend to commit funds to a project unless it has the zone capacity for the number of units that it's proposing.

11_21_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"It looks like a grand old house, but it was originally an old people's home. and it's received approval for funding through [ORGANIZATION]. They're proposing 88 affordable units including family housing and housing for people who experienced homelessness.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"So the 88 units that are currently funded under [ORGANIZATION] can be delivered under the existing zoning. With this change, it provides a little bit more flexibility for innovative housing, which is the developer, and they may be able to add additional units beyond the 88 units. And they are an affordable housing developer.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"They are an affordable housing developer, and the proposal is for 88 units, 12 permanent supportive housing units, 43... Family size units at 28 units 50 sorry 59 of the total units will be at from at 60% and below and 29 of the total units will be at 30% and below so to be clear they could meet the 88 units under the current zoning That zoning change gives them some more flexibility To potentially add more units to the overall site. Yeah,",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"I mean, one, we wouldn't commit it outside of a process, but we wouldn't commit it if it wasn't zoned for the number of units. Correct. And do you have a written contract that says these 88 affordable housing units will be built?",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"And you could change it to affordable housing units with it on a historic registry? Yeah, they're both rehabbing and doing some new construction on the site. All right.",portland
11_21_2019,affordable housing,"Um,  [ORGANIZATION]. Well, I strongly support this [ORGANIZATION] amendment because I believe it advances several priorities. I think this is a great project for the affordable housing bond and it will provide more than [ADDRESS] to live and",portland

12_21_2016,housing crisis,"But inclusionary housing, if you look at the record around the country, in and of itself does not solve the housing crisis.

11_29_2017,affordable housing,"And, you know, looking at that in the [ORGANIZATION] budget because it's been –  [LOCATION], and it's obviously a great concern among the community. I think... I'm very, very interested in the conversation about how we balance preserving historic buildings and historic neighborhoods and how we balance that with the need for more density and more affordable housing.",portland
11_29_2017,homelessness,"And then, of course, the whole [ORGANIZATION] conversation, which is one of the, I think,  homelessness, parking, and unreinforced masonry buildings may be the most controversial issues that I've faced in [ORGANIZATION] here. And I don't know, I was Googling this while you were talking about financing, and you may have already articulated, did you talk about our ORG1 program? No.",portland
11_29_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,There is an affordable housing crisis. We recognize all of these things and... And I think we'd really like to be a part of the solution.,portland
11_29_2017,housing crisis,"And parking. And the whole cost-benefit analysis from a public perspective, that if you're expending public funds on historic preservation, is that justified when we're in the midst of a housing crisis? Yes.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"I was most, many of the things I was going to say you've already discussed among yourselves already, which is very reassuring to me. One of them being the incentives, and I certainly support the idea of, you know, continuing to  house, an arts group, but I'm wondering if that same strategy couldn't be used to create or keep affordable housing in those unreinforced masonry structures if a covenant couldn't be made in some cases where there would be a certain level of rent for X number of [ORGANIZATION] in return for some subsidy or revolving loan for the seismic reinforcement. Because I'm obviously aware of the financial tradeoffs.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"And that's just not fair. And there needs to be some [STREET] that we can do some bridge building, some better understanding of what's going on here between the...  the need for affordable housing and the need for some kind of preservation. And if there's anything I can do to help, I will, but somehow there needs to be some higher level of leadership convening this.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"We'd like to see better incentives to retain existing housing, most of which is our more affordable housing. And we'd like to see additional provisions that ensure the compatibility of infill development and so forth. Okay.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"We need a demolition by neglect ordinance in this town. Many cities, including [ORGANIZATION], use this mechanism to help ensure public safety and prevent the loss of historic resources. If one had been in [STREET] in [PERSON], we might not have experienced the outrageous loss of the FAC0 building, which, by the [STREET], could have been used for affordable housing, despite what the claim of the developer was.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"As the report recommends, targeting more modest resources and more modest neighborhoods can minimize displacement of vulnerable communities. One such area is, surprisingly, is [ORGANIZATION], densely populated with affordable housing [ORGANIZATION]. Affordable housing and historic preservation should proceed hand in hand.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"And I suspect it's not appropriate to create them exactly the [STREET] they are [ORGANIZATION], which, again, I will say the council has no role in creating.  applying them directly and I believe that it's appropriate again for the council to make the choices about the designation and whether a resource is worthy to get some of these tax abatements and you know you can consider whether you're achieving your [ORGANIZATION] goals and your affordable housing goals as well as your historic preservation goals when you give a tax abatement.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"And I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to support the report and the work of the commission and staff. It was very nicely done and great work over [LOCATION]. Also, I want to be here to say historic preservation and affordable housing can go hand in hand.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"In some of the buildings you've done that are in historic buildings,  properties or unreinforced masonry buildings. The city financed those projects knowing that the buildings had issues. If we're going to come along [ORGANIZATION] and set a mandate and we're talking about a community asset that is affordable housing, social housing that is serving our lowest income residents, I think the city has to have some skin in the game.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"I have personally two [ORGANIZATION] properties. They're both basement conversions, and they rent for $8.95 a month. And so that's affordable housing.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"Specifically, I think in this report, the question of unreinforced masonry buildings and affordable housing, yes, these are preservation issues and it's appropriate to think about and address them in that [STREET]. But as the discussion has gone on [ORGANIZATION], we all realize that there's broader concerns. I think that this report and [ORGANIZATION] approach to bringing all that in is very thoughtful and certainly one to be commended and one we can support.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"The first is a request to increase...  the amount of floor area that a project earning a central city and inclusionary housing bonus, a commercial project, an office building, can earn in response to concerns that the cost per square foot in our current inclusionary housing program is high enough that it's going to discourage use of the bonus. And the result of that would be that whereas we would just get less resources in for affordable housing through the bonus if the bonus isn't used, and secondly, we run the risk of having central city buildings underbuilt. [ORGANIZATION] put a fee of $24 a square foot on it.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"The money that's raised by this goes into the affordable housing fund. We're proposing instead of one square foot for $24, we amend the zoning code in this case for an interim period, [ORGANIZATION] is what we're proposing, and make it one and a half square feet for $24. The impact of that is right to reduce the effective cost per square foot for a commercial building.",portland
11_29_2017,affordable housing,"My recollection is that we wanted to create a slight disincentive from people using fee-in-lieu because we thought that the actual –  on-site affordable housing component, particularly in the central city, was preferable. Could you respond? Yeah, you're absolutely correct.",portland
10_03_2018,homelessness,"Communications. Item [DATE], a request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding the petition for a compassionate response to homelessness. I had a question.",portland

10_03_2018,homelessness,"[DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding commentary from [STREET] routes.  [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding compassionate response to homelessness. And [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding compassionate response to homelessness.  Very good. Good morning.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless; homelessness,"I want to first start out by...  recognizing the tragic death of [ORGANIZATION] in our city. And [ORGANIZATION] we're here to bring to you a petition co-sponsored by community activists, religious leaders, civil rights organizations, academics, lawyers, homeless advocates, and one city council candidate. In addition, more than 4,000 individuals from across [ORGANIZATION] have signed on to this petition, which very simply asks that we change our strategy for addressing homelessness.  from one which has resulted in over 53% of arrests being of homeless people, to one which actually tries to solve the problems facing them, including lack of housing, mental health and addiction services, and basic hygiene for people living on the streets.",portland
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"While we realize that creating affordable housing is a long-term effort, what we are asking can be implemented immediately or in the near future. Number one, develop a robust group of first responders who are trained to deal with mental health and addiction crises who would be the ones to connect people living on the streets with services. These first responders could also address the livability issues like needles in parks, garbage in neighborhoods, and low-level theft if victims did not want to involve the police.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless; housing crisis,"Two, declare a moratorium on sweeps of homeless camps. Until we can offer adequate alternatives, sweeping people from one part of the city to another part of the city is an expensive and harmful [STREET] to deal with the housing crisis. Number three, provide basic services for hygiene for people living on the [STREET], including restrooms, water, and garbage disposal.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"There are already successful examples of city-sanctioned camps, so let's expand this model. And five, track arrests of homeless people, publish data on a city website, and hold responsible parties accountable for achieving a drastic reduction of arrests. We should not have to rely on the investigative journalism of the [ORGANIZATION] to learn basic facts about how the city deals with its homeless population.",portland
10_03_2018,homelessness,So we're asking that city council use such discretion again to stop arresting people living on the streets for low-level offenses. While reasonable people can disagree about the most effective ways to address the crisis of homelessness...  We must all affirm the dignity and humanity of people living on the streets. The recent vigilante actions by Portlanders who videotape and photograph people entering a needle exchange program is a dangerous descent into mob dehumanization of our most vulnerable neighbors.,portland
10_03_2018,homeless,So I call on the mayor and city council to stop mass incarceration of homeless people and to speak out against the dangerous anti-homeless vigilante actions. Thank you. Thank you.,portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"I was homeless, addicted, and they arrested me and took me to [PERSON], and they let me out immediately. And with the charges that I was arrested for, I would have been sent to prison in [PERSON]. After going to jail so many times, Judge [PERSON], I got arrested for selling $5 worth of crack to an undercover cop.",portland

10_03_2018,homeless,"Yeah, so I'm clean and sober, been clean and sober since [ORGANIZATION] when I started my advocacy. That's right. But being clean and sober, I'm also being victimized by the police, by the community, because everybody thinks all homeless people are drunks, druggies, and mentally ill.",portland
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"I'm neither one of those. And there was a lot of, when I first started my advocacy, like within [ORGANIZATION], I had elected officials, church leaders, even people, all these influential people, even people in affordable housing, trying to get me into affordable housing, but couldn't get me in there because... I was clean and sober.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless; homelessness,"I wasn't a drunk, a druggie, or mentally ill. So there's a lot of homeless people out there, what I call the functional homeless people, that can't get inside but are being victimized by the [STREET] people are thinking of homelessness. When you talk about the mental illness, there's a lot of sleep deprivation out there, which...  can be thought of as mental illness, but it's not.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless; affordable housing,"It takes [ORGANIZATION] for that to happen. So what you're basically telling people when you say, I'm all about affordable housing, is wait, homeless people, wait for [ORGANIZATION] until we get enough affordable housing. Sometimes we don't hit that mark, and you have to wait a little bit longer.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"And if you're clean and sober, you have to wait a little bit longer than that. You're being victimized out there all this time because of the [STREET] people think, which is really, really bad on homeless people when they're trying to help themselves, they're trying to pick themselves on up, but yet we have non-homeless people that come on over and tell us that we're mentally ill, we're lazy, that we don't want to get a job, we're unkept, things like that. Yet it's the [STREET] the people have put homeless people through this stuff.",portland
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"You know, in most places you can't do that. So, yeah, that's what we need is more right-to-dream tools, tent cities, and shelters for a temporary solution until we have enough affordable housing. Because me, I am traumatized by all of this stuff.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"You know, I might not show it, but, yeah, I've been victimized many times out there. And there are a lot of homeless people out there because of the mindset people put in people's minds, not homeless people's minds.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"You don't have it in front of you, but the clerk has it. One is a recent press release about the related issue of business improvement districts, and it has some policy recommendations, and then also a recent report that provides practical guidance for authorized homeless encampments. That's from [ORGANIZATION].",portland
10_03_2018,homelessness,"Although we're here asking you for policy changes at the outset, I don't want you to think that we're saying that you aren't trying or the city hasn't taken steps to try to address these issues. I've heard from each of you about things the city has done, and we thank you for those things. At the same time, there's also things that are operating in our policies and our systems that are both causing harm and not helping to alleviate homelessness, and that are also diverting resources from solutions that would help.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless; houseless,"More specifically, those things that are causing harm and diverting our resources are the repeated displacement of people who have no safe [STREET] to go, repeated police contact for people who have experienced trauma, and criminal justice system involvement for people who truly just need services and a [STREET] to safely sleep. As long as over 50% of arrests in the city are of homeless, are of our houseless neighbors, there's something fundamentally wrong with our policies and systems that we have put in [STREET] to address this emergency. This situation with massive numbers of our friends and neighbors without housing and without safety truly is a state of emergency.",portland
10_03_2018,homelessness,"I have personally spoken with a variety of folks in law enforcement on this issue, from officers to representatives of the police union,  to folks higher up in the chain, and those conversations lead me to believe that many in law enforcement also believe that more police is not the solution to addressing homelessness. We have set up a system where it is somehow law enforcement's responsibility to fix this problem, but they literally can't fix it. More policing, more sweeps, more identification checks, which I still am getting reports about happening, those things are not going to help.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"My colleagues worked really hard to put this all together. Over 4,000 people signed our petition so far once the Oregonian report came out that over half of the arrests [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] were of homeless people. It seems like [LOCATION] we were here arguing against adding more police in [DATE].",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"We said that we did not want this additional money going to new police officers because we anticipated that that would affect our homeless population negatively. It feels like [ORGANIZATION] that we were here arguing that increased police staffing would not improve livability overall in [ORGANIZATION], and later we were vindicated by the [ORGANIZATION] report. But the homeless population and their advocates argued that  The additional police staffing would negatively impact their lives through the profiling, harassment, and sweeps they experience.",portland
10_03_2018,homelessness,"Meanwhile, neighborhood groups following in many ways the lead of the decisions made by this council are coalescing in places like [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and you'll even see people from [PERSON] potentially here [TIME] saying they also want more policing around urban livability issues. But this isn't really about livability. This is about excluding people experiencing homelessness, homelessness.  from the public eye, from neighborhoods, from communities.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"And as we've clearly demonstrated [ORGANIZATION], additional police are not making our homeless people safer. Thank you. What we need to think about is are we going to make [ORGANIZATION] a [STREET] that feels safe for elites, for business class?",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"You may be surprised to hear that I agree with much, in fact, the vast majority of everything that you've just said. First of all, let me say...  that I agree wholeheartedly that the police are being put into a nearly impossible situation. They are, along with other first responders, fire EMTs, they are now the first responders to a homeless crisis that I think most of us now acknowledge as a crisis.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"And the budget that this council adopted...  [ORGANIZATION] actually has three more data analysts, and it focused on issues around public safety in particular, and this is an important part of that data collection effort. I want to tell you that it is current police policy that we do not arrest people for being homeless. There is no policy that would support arresting somebody because they are homeless.",portland
10_03_2018,homelessness,"There's, of course, the [ORGANIZATION] petition that I will be in receipt of shortly, and I hope to talk with the people about that.  of [ORGANIZATION] who I think share many, if not all, of your views with regard to this. Not to be confused by the [ORGANIZATION] petition I received [ORGANIZATION] saying that we were too soft.  on issues around homelessness and criminality and livability. It has been my objective to separate these issues, have a compassionate, effective, data-driven approach around homelessness that includes prevention.",portland
10_03_2018,homelessness,"And I was very encouraged when I met with mayors from all around the state  on [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] down in [ORGANIZATION], and our only subject of conversation for [PERSON] was homelessness, we talked about where are the points of commonality and agreement that we can get behind and support? Because...  I've got to tell you, if [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] can't figure out how to get out of this situation with regard to homelessness and poverty and income inequality and mental health and addiction issues that are going untreated and a lack of housing, if we cannot figure out how to get out of this box together, it doesn't paint a very hopeful picture for anywhere else. We can do it.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"It was a stark contrast between the panel we had, between this panel and the panel we had [ORGANIZATION] from a particular neighborhood who started with a laundry list of complaints about the homeless, did not offer any compassion, let alone solutions, and ended with telling us we were making it too hard to be landlords in this city. Thank you. Mayor was surprised I didn't jump in on that, but I really honestly felt like it would be an exercise in futility because there's just such a lack of understanding in the broader community about the forces that have brought us to where we are [LOCATION].",portland
10_03_2018,homelessness,"There's a 96% correlation between housing affordability and homelessness. So anyone who wants to tell me that we're making it too hard to be a landlord or that regulating our rental market is not going to help this crisis doesn't know what they're talking about, frankly. I agree with all of your solutions.",portland
10_03_2018,homelessness,"I also agree that more police is not going to remedy the problem. livability issues that people associate with homelessness, which is really the only justification I was hearing for the increase. I didn't want the increase.",portland
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"I appreciate what [ORGANIZATION] said about [ORGANIZATION], and it reminded me of how offensive it was [ORGANIZATION] at a public forum when someone who was opposing 26-199 said it would lead to the creation of ghettos. Now, the logic of that is that if you invest in affordable housing, you're creating ghettos, ghettos like [ORGANIZATION]. So I was pleased, [ORGANIZATION], that you pointed out that in terms of just raw percentage, we have more affordable housing in the [PERSON] than any other part of our city, and we should not be using words like loaded terms like ghettos to describe providing affordable housing for working families.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"now, and then later had to cost overrun and ended up grabbing some more expensive money at the back end. Plus, there's the whole beauty of having a 90,000 building remodel going on while thousands of people are sleeping outside, and we don't have any large funded homeless shelters. But, of course, this item is only about the financial precision to possibly pay down the principal with the principal, so we don't pay interest or something like that.",portland
10_03_2018,homeless,"In [ORGANIZATION] and $500 million, it may be upgraded. Yet [PERSON] market and homeless programs take [STREET] under the bridge, and there is no evidence that the city has concern to warn. To placard one building type is the equivalent to spot zoning.",portland
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"So if you do that... And I think this would...  go over into other things. You know, old brick buildings have lower rentals, and we're talking about affordable housing?",portland
10_03_2018,affordable housing,"You might be losing a whole bunch of affordable housing with what you're doing. So you need a whole larger economic impact study to really know what's being affected, and that's before this is...  Don't do it. Thank you.",portland
12_15_2016,affordable housing,"And we're trying to create all sorts of affordable housing opportunities in what we call high-opportunity areas, areas that are good neighborhoods, good schools, good parks. And you're in essence telling me that if you live there now, you're forever somehow vested. And if you're new, you're out of luck.",portland
12_15_2016,affordable housing,"But this is better late than never, I think, and I'm hopeful that this policy will help keep some oil in the ground and will help provide eventually for more affordable housing and provide a foundation for more sustainable policies and developments. At least until social and technological developments make this less of an issue for our city, and maybe in [ORGANIZATION] when we maybe have less demand for on-[STREET] parking. I think this right now program sends a message to developers.",portland
12_15_2016,affordable housing,"I think that when we talk about equity and people, I mean, there is a large group of people in this city who can't afford cars. And when I ride the bus, that's a lot  a lot of who's on the bus with me. So I think when we talk about who's really the vulnerable members of our society and who's affected by this policy, you know, we're not collecting money and extending...  try and extend bus [TIME] or make it possible to build more affordable housing near where their jobs are, we're focusing on a car-dependent system that, as we saw [ORGANIZATION], really doesn't serve people in a lot of circumstances.",portland
12_15_2016,affordable housing,"When we were here [ORGANIZATION] asking for parking minimums, the reaction from council was, gee, we're looking into reexamining them elsewhere in the city. We don't want to adopt something [ORGANIZATION] and then undo it. Well, now that you've made your decision about the rest of the city, which is very much what we wanted, which is having parking minimums but exempting affordable housing units and projects, we would like to put us on the same wavelength as the rest of the city.",portland

10_11_2018,affordable housing,"If the goal is to keep artists in [ORGANIZATION], I feel that talks about affordable art space have to include talks about affordable housing, living wages, and affordability issues. and utilities of other necessities. Non-diverse arts-dependent businesses and non-profits also need to examine the ways in which they exclude people from historically marginalized groups and commit to inclusion.",portland
10_11_2018,affordable housing,"I'm looking at your help, [ORGANIZATION], to really do this paradigm shift, where I think we've gotten really used to thinking about art as an object that we collect and we take care of as stewards. But in [ORGANIZATION], we've shifted away from that. And I think really why we keep asking for affordable housing, affordable food, affordable transportation, is that for us to make things that look like art and culture, we need to thrive first.",portland
10_11_2018,affordable housing,"The thing that angers them the most is the notion that government is deciding what's best for them, whether it's in your womb or in your tax book, your checkbook. So I would urge you to really...  Stop playing these games because it may backfire. It may not backfire on the arts tax, but it may backfire on the next city affordable housing bond measure or the next iteration of the children's levy where voters feel so frustrated that what they say in writing doesn't seem to be reflected in what happens in fact, and they take it out on us.",portland

And while we didn't really talk about our housing strategy or the work that we're doing around affordable and workforce housing, that obviously is critical to this. And we saw that lesson from our friends down in [ORGANIZATION], that as the cost of housing swamped their supply at a much faster rate than what's happened even here in [PERSON], we saw that their arts and their culture and even their hospitality, their culture,  their restaurant culture, their culinary culture, all of those things came under significant stress as a result of the housing crisis they experienced there.",portland

12_30_2015,homeless; homelessness,"As you know, [ORGANIZATION] and many other places are in a state of emergency regarding housing and homelessness, which at least in part is the result of the corporatization of our society and the concentration of wealth in the top 1%. Too many corporations pay their employees less than a living wage, send jobs overseas, don't contribute their fair share of taxes to our society, and all after using our public coffers for their specific infrastructure needs. Not only are homeless, but our schools and our roads testify to this state of affairs.",portland

09_24_2015,homeless,"We believe that the $90 ticket currently issued is punitive enough to deter repeat offenses and yet reasonable enough so as not to deter people from coming back to the district.

And I particularly want to say in regards to homeless people, disabled people, elderly people, people who are...",portland
11_28_2018,homeless,"There's a lot of police harassment also on the [ORGANIZATION]. In certain areas, there's some dragnet areas down by...  like the bus depot, [ORGANIZATION], and over by FAC0 where they have the dining sisters of the [STREET], and they'll harass people down there. So I'm wondering how she's going to deal with people who are homeless and are through no fault of their own, through a lot of, you know, poor...  service problems that we're having in [ORGANIZATION] for the homeless, how she's going to deal with that when those people are dealt with unfairly.",portland
11_12_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"Now, if you have done that in the past and you've been denied, I don't think that's a good direction to go. Now, one of the biggest concerns I have on this is, Mayor [PERSON], you have declared [ORGANIZATION] a state of emergency in housing. As you know, the [ORGANIZATION] grant is obviously very concerned about affordable housing and homelessness.",portland
11_12_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Actually, I appreciate [ORGANIZATION] bringing this up. I'm trying to be concise [TIME], but [ORGANIZATION] looks not just at shocks, which are sort of those sudden events like floods and earthquakes that we often think about, particularly with emergency management, but also at chronic stresses, which diminish our resilience over time and also make people very vulnerable sometimes.  to even small floods, for instance. And so the application actually does talk a great deal about the affordable housing crisis and that being the greatest stress that threatens our city resilience.",portland
11_12_2015,affordable housing,"My hope is that if we fill this position, they will be able to channel some of the energy to do something about earthquake preparedness to connect those folks with people working on affordable housing, because I do see them as related. How many times have we applied for this? Twice.",portland
11_12_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], we're wishing you luck on this one. First thing that I encountered when I was elected in [ORGANIZATION] was a [DATE] storm that was coming our [STREET] and a very disjointed system for dealing with homeless individuals and families that were on the streets. It was your bureau and [PERSON] in particular who called together all of the players and hammered out a written plan and educated us about things like incident commander and [ORGANIZATION] and all the various components of a plan.",portland
11_12_2015,homelessness,Hi.  [ORGANIZATION] thank you all it was a good process and we've gotten to a good result i i'm very heartened by our continued commitment to housing and homelessness every chance that this council gets to do the right thing on housing and homelessness we have been and that's great  We also need to just make sure we understand that we're going to be in some difficult budget choices in the near future because of the commitments that we've made. I'm happy to have that problem because I like the commitments. I also just want to continue to flag the concern I have about the police bureau and overtime.,portland

10_16_2019,houseless,"Indigenous people, Native people, tribal people will also be enumerated in person. And so [ORGANIZATION] will send someone out, to places where they understand houseless people to be and they will count them in person there. Let me just say that they're not going to have a lot of success because people who are houseless don't talk to people who say I'm from the government and I'm here to help.",portland
10_16_2019,houseless,"It would really be important to partner with organizations who already have a relationship with folks who are houseless. So I, and quite frankly, you will find in the population of people who are houseless, the hard to count population that we say that we're targeting. So I would hope that you would add one or two organizations that actually have a relationship with folks who are houseless as part of the team.",portland
10_16_2019,houseless,"That's right. Commissioner [PERSON]. PERSON1, could you explain? explain what you meant by not having forms for the houseless population?",portland
10_16_2019,houseless,Right. Houseless people are not included in the hard to count traditional bucket at all because they would not have homes. It's based on the 76% response rate.,portland

10_16_2019,homeless,"It's vital statistics. But it is so profoundly important and we, you know, this particular census is so fraught. I'm very interested in this issue around the homeless count because we struggle as a city to get an accurate count of our own homeless population.",portland

10_16_2019,houseless,We are talking about counting people so that we can get the resources. I would say hire houseless people to count the houseless. I think that's a great idea.,portland
10_16_2019,homeless; homelessness,"They said on that list of five, you would have thought the hard to count would have definitely been the homeless community without any doubt. We're in a state of emergency. And the main thing from the city, the county, the state is to focus on the homelessness and the homeless themselves on making sure they step up and they do the census survey.",portland
10_16_2019,homeless,"And I'm proposing that what we do for the homeless community is that if we can do this by law and that'll need to be checked, we offer to pay them $20. You step forward and you do this, you receive $20 for participating. Now look at what Commissioner [PERSON] stated.",portland

10_16_2019,affordable housing,"This is a pressing need for renters with disabilities, older renters, and low-income renters, people of color, and many others. Right now, in this city, it's nearly impossible to find accessible, affordable housing, but an inclusive rental registry could change that for the better. The disability community needs this to keep us out of medical facilities, institutions, and off the streets, because that's where people with disabilities end up when they can't find appropriate housing.",portland

What we didn't know at the time was how lucky we had gotten and that one of the partners was [PERSON] of ORG2. and in the time he spent in GPE1 center working on the brewery project he quickly saw what we saw in our community he saw a gathering [STREET] a [STREET] where commerce should naturally occur and where people should live work and play our small victory led to advocacy for an action plan which led to a request for interest which led to an ambitious proposal from palindrome communities to restore our town center and before you we have the proposal to provide funding to realize the first phase of a development plan that is really about a true lens revival  PERSON1 and his team have been integral parts of our community since the opening of [ORGANIZATION], and they work to ensure that they are intentionally including us, not just bringing us along, but including us in the anticipated development in every aspect of the project, including making sure that we're keeping space for our neighbors who need affordable housing, but consciously mixing it with market rate housing to ensure that everyone has access to good services and our small businesses are supported.",portland

11_09_2016,affordable housing,"Somebody that just spoke [ORGANIZATION] also is, and who is helping push this proposal through, happens to build the type of housing that would benefit and is also on [ORGANIZATION]. I was appalled to watch them group together and hijack the process and put through a very self-serving agenda and wrap it in the disguise of affordable housing, which it will not create.

11_09_2016,affordable housing,I also would like to see it go farther. I think there are ways that we can support. We have opportunities to directly promote affordable housing in this as well.,portland
11_09_2016,affordable housing,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I am the [ORGANIZATION] representative on the residential infill project. The assertion that this proposal will provide affordable housing does not hold up to close analysis.,portland
11_09_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,This proposal is simply deregulation that allows the imperfect market to determine the future of our neighborhoods. Analysts have stated that the current reason we have a housing crisis is that we trust in the private market to solve the problem. Increased supply does not lead to more affordable housing.,portland
11_09_2016,affordable housing,A [ORGANIZATION] study states that it will take [ORGANIZATION]...  to produce affordable housing to the first-time homebuyer. Trickle-down economics has failed in the housing market. Duplexes and triplexes are primarily rental housing.,portland

11_09_2016,affordable housing,"Nonprofit affordable housing providers, disability rights advocates, home builders, community-based groups, neighborhood associations, and more. My comments [ORGANIZATION] are going to focus on one issue. The residential infill project fills in a significant gap in [ORGANIZATION]'s housing supply by providing smaller housing choices throughout our neighborhoods that are relatively more affordable for more of [ORGANIZATION]'s families.",portland
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"the [ORGANIZATION] proposal delivers family housing in family neighborhoods at a scale that meets the needs of more portlanders you'll also hear that the [ORGANIZATION] proposal will not provide housing affordable to portlanders the economic report commissioned by you shows this to not be true by reducing the scale of new dwellings and allowing more missing middle housing the economic report demonstrates that more affordable housing will be provided and you'll hear that the [ORGANIZATION] should only apply to a narrow band around corridors and centers  [ORGANIZATION] has always provided itself on being a welcoming community for all, and that means adapting to changing families and those of different economic, social, and racial backgrounds. This is not the time to shut some people out of some neighborhoods.

11_09_2016,affordable housing,"Housing choices that fall between single-family homes and apartments can also help address the historical inequities of access to self-sufficiency by providing homeownership opportunities. but we know there is still a shortage of housing choices in [ORGANIZATION] currently minimum lot sizes and density limitations constrain the number of homes that can be developed limiting our opportunity to deliver affordable homes by allowing for modest increases in density within the residential zones recommended in the proposal it would open an opportunity not only for [ORGANIZATION] but the market as a whole to provide homes for even more families when it comes to more families  When it comes to housing, every unit really does count. That is why we support the proposals put forth in the residential ORG1 project and see opportunities to further strengthen support for affordable housing development through the proposal.",portland
11_09_2016,affordable housing,"We think it is important to incentivize affordable and accessible homes to reflect the needs of the [ORGANIZATION] community. So we recommend reasonable density bonuses for permanently affordable and accessible units to be added back into the proposal.

With the creation of a grassroots organization that we called [ORGANIZATION], the idea was to see if the same concerns were shared by other neighborhoods.

12_16_2015,affordable housing,"I think this is a historic moment, understanding that we're putting the first time in –  people have fought for [ORGANIZATION] to have a dedicated stream of revenue for affordable housing. And this is a historic moment, even though it's not up to scale that it needs to be. And I just want to say thank you for everyone for taking the time to do the work and look at this very complex issue.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"But I actually sat on the committee that sort of devised some of the [ORGANIZATION] and short-term rental rules [ORGANIZATION]. And also [LOCATION], I was here testifying that those funds should be dedicated to affordable housing. And it's great to be back [PERSON] and to see that we've come to that conclusion [PERSON].",portland
12_16_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"but it's a small piece. And we know the elephant in the room is the affordable housing crisis that we're all trying to solve. And they always say, how do you eat an elephant?",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"And I guess I would add that, sort of echoing [ORGANIZATION]' comments, we don't know actually what the impact is. There would be different ways to mitigate it. Do we just outlaw short-term rentals, or do we ask the beneficiaries, the companies that run these, to actually give much more significant money to fund additional affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]?",portland
12_16_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"Again, Commissioner [PERSON], I think you're making some real good moves here pertaining to the homeless, providing more affordable housing, and again, also to the Mayor on declaring a state of emergency on housing. Now, again, I think [PERSON] is absolutely an advantage to this city. We're forgetting to calculate that they also go out there and obtain more units that aren't currently on the market.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,They do that through aggressive marketing. And also what we're missing with [ORGANIZATION] is that their system is bringing in tourists from around the world that spend a tremendous amount of money through this local economy –  that will far weigh out any losses that you can calculate pertaining to affordable housing. And you must keep that in mind and also always keep in mind [PERSON].,portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"And I think we need to keep that in consideration. Issue number three is that  On the affordable housing issue, I agree with Mayor [PERSON]'s position on going for more shelters. I think it's a good move at this time until we can implement other things as bonds that we can get the more permanent housing.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"And that's the most important piece of this puzzle is how we continue to get more resources for the affordable housing, permanent housing, and making sure we have enough shelter space, which Mayor [PERSON] is taking some risks there. He's using eco-diversions.  transportation, shuttle buses, transportation to these shelters. I think it's very innovative, and I think it's going to work.",portland
12_16_2015,housing crisis,"But it is nevertheless a good discipline for us to follow, because if we're going to make choices about prioritizing the housing crisis, we will have to –  we will have to make choices about doing less in other areas, even in a better economy, even with a bigger general fund than we've currently forecast. So there's no question this isn't a free good. But if there was ever a time when this would be less painful, it's when our general fund is growing as it is right now.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"So we do not have a good budget situation. I think that it is reasonable, given that there apparently is evidence that the short-term rentals are reducing the supply of overall affordable housing, to dedicate some money from short-term rental revenues to housing. However, so I am going to support this, but without making any commitment as to how I'll vote on any other budget issue.",portland
12_16_2015,housing crisis,"I don't remember people raising all these concerns about doing so because as a council, we agreed there was a transportation funding crisis. DATE0, we have said there's a housing crisis, and we're going to focus our attention on meeting the needs of people who are literally dying on our streets. So we make choices.",portland
12_16_2015,housing crisis,"We are using a revenue source to mitigate the negative impact of an activity of which I remain very dubious. Second,  Commissioner [PERSON] has laid out a vision for using a housing investment fund as a flexible tool to address this housing crisis. My political mentor, [PERSON], set up a federal housing trust fund.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"PERSON0? Well, I appreciate the discussion, and I know this is a vexing decision to make, but I think, as I said in my...  opening remarks when we consider that we have a deficit of 24,000, a lack of 24,000 households or 24,000 residents who lack access to affordable housing, and you add another 10,000 in our comp plan projections. You know, we've got to start somewhere with a steady state stream of revenue that can be used for capital investment in affordable housing.",portland
12_16_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And that's exactly what this is going for. And with the tantalizing ability to use revenue bonds to turn this $1.2 million into $12 to $30 million dollars,  and is just an opportunity that I think we can't pass up. All of us have said we are in an affordable housing crisis.",portland
12_16_2015,housing crisis,"I had the opportunity to meet with my colleagues [ORGANIZATION] who are mayors of other [ORGANIZATION] cities and had sort of a teasing conversation with Mayor [PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION] that [PERSON]'s trying really hard not to be [ORGANIZATION], and actually [ORGANIZATION] wished it had had the chance to not be [ORGANIZATION] either because the housing crisis there is so much greater than ours. So I think that's a great question. So we really need to act with every tool at our disposal, with some level of risk, and with the credible claim to the people that are up against it in housing that we are doing everything we can with every tool that we have.",portland
12_16_2015,housing crisis,"And I think this is consistent with that. We will spend less on shelters someday if we spend more on housing now. We need to spend more on shelters at the moment, and that's a cost of doing business in this housing crisis.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I work for a nonprofit called [ORGANIZATION]. And so we provide services and work alongside residents living in affordable housing. So we're there to build community amongst those residents and enhance individual quality of life opportunities.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"They started visiting us on site and teaching us. like map reading skills and doing activities to talk about walking and moving around the city in a less utilitarian [STREET], because that's a lot of folks in affordable housing are using it, and in a more engaging sort of community-building [STREET]. So this led to group walking tours, and the highlight of that was really the resident participants getting to share stories about  about [ORGANIZATION], getting to share their stories.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"Now, what I'd like to know on this is that  when we're looking at the extraction industries and putting them on this list, is that with the money that we actually divest, where are we going to put that money? And that's my main focus right now is that can we – is there any possibility to look at being able to somehow use some of that money toward affordable housing? And why I ask that is that we're taking a tremendous amount of money from these companies –  And where are we going to put it?",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"So I like the extraction industries removing that money, but can we put it towards some type of affordable housing type situation? And that's my question. Mr. [PERSON], it's not that we're taking money out of these companies.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"And my point to you is that,  Is there a [STREET] to divest out of the fossil fuel industry and invest in affordable housing industry? Is there a [STREET] to do that? And we are investing money into these companies.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"So putting the money into affordable housing would be a big departure from our current financial policies where we maintain a certain pool of investments based on certain criteria that are applied to the companies. Even if you could reach that same return, and that would be backed by certain investors to make sure you have that guaranteed return. PERSON0, this is really probably not the right [STREET] to have this discussion right now.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"I completely applaud your idea of using the funds  [ORGANIZATION] funds have a little more flexibility to do that, depending on the law. These are heavily circumscribed, and we can't put it into affordable housing. That's the short answer.",portland
12_16_2015,affordable housing,"Why I brought this up during my communication is that I wanted it to possibly be looked at  from various individuals to see if there can't be some changes or some directions made toward affordable housing with some of these funds. And that's all I've asked at this time. And then they can counter back and tell me why it can't be done, and then we can look at possible ways of understanding that maybe we can go in a certain direction to do it.",portland
10_22_2015,affordable housing,"This is for $968,000, which is [ORGANIZATION]'s portion of the home funding, which is a federal funding formula for housing assistance.  determined by population and other criteria the city of [ORGANIZATION] intends to use this to fund tenant-based rental assistance development of affordable housing and down payment assistance to low-income home buyers so just in case anyone's wondering if this is not us spending portland general fund on [ORGANIZATION] it's us being a conduit for federal funds to [ORGANIZATION] yeah",portland
10_22_2015,homeless,"Okay. Now we have one more item left over from [ORGANIZATION]'s calendar, and that's [DATE]. Okay.  amend contract with [ORGANIZATION] to add $50,000 to house chronically homeless women for a total not to exceed $160,000.",portland
10_22_2015,homelessness,"Commissioner [PERSON] again. Thank you, Mayor. From our [ORGANIZATION] point in time homelessness count, we know that on any given night more than 1,000 women experience homelessness in [ORGANIZATION], including more than 560 without basic emergency shelter or transitional housing.",portland
10_22_2015,homelessness,"Without going into too much detail, this funding within this amendment will allow Catholic charities to help 10 additional households headed by women to move from homelessness into housing. And this doesn't represent an increase in funds. It's really a reprogramming of funds from joined to Catholic charities serving the same population.",portland
10_22_2015,affordable housing,"It's access to housing for people who are here for [ORGANIZATION] at a time, and many of our outpatient transplant patients are. If they can't get affordable housing, they can't get care. And so that guest house, if you will, with 76 units of housing, much of it free for those people who stay there is to meet that need.",portland
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"So I'll follow up with you on that. Thank you. And the other thing to the point of the conversation you just had with my colleague, I just want to acknowledge that there is some conversation that's percolating about how to bring down the cost of affordable housing.",portland
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"But number three, and the one where you potentially have the greatest savings at the greatest cost, is backing off family waste jobs. So if we seek to build affordable housing for low-income families but we don't pay the workers a living wage, that's a problem. So keep your eye on that because those are three ideas that when you hear about bringing down the cost of affordable housing, here's a little secret.",portland
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"It must all happen. You have to provide wages for people to sustain living and support their families, and then to move into other housing and make that affordable housing affordable for the next family. So we're in agreement.",portland
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"No.  That role? Anyway, if that's the case, then I'd like you to put your heads together and do that. So we ask that the city take a convening role in building the partnerships that will establish this much-needed integration of  a first floor multicultural entrepreneurial incubator opportunity, 9 through 12 public education training in the health industry, manufacturing, and possibly construction, [TIME] adult workforce training, affordable housing, and [ORGANIZATION] relocation or office space to help fund the whole thing.",portland
05_04_2017,homelessness; affordable housing,"First, I would like to thank you for your focus on affordable housing and homelessness issues and your advocacy at the state level. in the support of affordable housing and the tools for anti-displacement and tenant rights. [ORGANIZATION] has been very busy over [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"We have met with city, county, metro, and state elected officials to advocate for adequate affordable housing and for anti-displacement tools such as lifting the ban on rent control,  and the elimination of no-cause evictions, which will help stabilize the housing for [ORGANIZATION] residents and also balance the affordable and accessible housing supply throughout [ORGANIZATION]. We also have joined with the partners of [ORGANIZATION] to advocate for funding for expanding home ownership for moderate and low-income and people of color. When it comes to anti-displacement tools, we did advocate and support the inclusionary zoning program here at the city.",portland
05_04_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"The committee's advocacy for this program was because we were seeing the housing crisis impacting [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] has a significant amount of privately owned affordable housing, or should I say we did have a significant amount. Rents are constantly going up.",portland
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"We felt that in the short term with this program, we could increase the amount of regulated affordable housing for [ORGANIZATION] while efforts were made to construct additional affordable multi-family units. Unfortunately, in [LOCATION], Mayor's budget, it was reduced to less than $500,000. The slow implementation of this program has been part of the issue.",portland
05_04_2017,affordable housing,It will be less costly to be proactive in providing long-term affordable housing now than to try to buy back as what is being done in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [ORGANIZATION]. I would be negligent as a school board member. if I didn't mention one of the most important factors of stabilizing housing.,portland
05_04_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"As a housing committee, we will continue to advocate for equitable funding for additional affordable housing with a focus on ongoing funds, one-time funds, and we will be asking for 26% of the housing bond funds to be spent in [ORGANIZATION], equal to what the population percentage is. As a committee, we will also continue to work with the city and other local jurisdictions to advocate for legislative changes to make it possible for our local entities to have the anti-displacement tools they need to handle this housing crisis. Again, thank you for your time and your support on these important housing issues.",portland
05_04_2017,affordable housing,"And there were some things in the report that, frankly, troubled me greatly. And the trend line on affordable housing investments in [ORGANIZATION], I'd like to go back and look at those numbers. That concerns me.",portland
04_26_2017,houseless,"I think that you guys spend money [ORGANIZATION] and it really has nothing to do with the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] and their well-being But it has everything to do with making your perfect little town even wider and even prettier for white people and it's shameful and  It's shameful that I have to go to the county to get help with the houseless issue because you guys, I can't keep you awake there. I'm sorry, is this germane to the contract?",portland
04_26_2017,homelessness,And we had to do an awful lot of that work on the fly. The good news is I think we learned a lesson or two from that experience in terms of preparation and collaboration. And [ORGANIZATION] has really stepped up in a big [STREET].,portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"Every time we hear conversations about affordable housing, there's a huge segment of the population that doesn't get addressed, and that is people like myself who are over [ORGANIZATION]. people like myself who are can be deemed disabled who are living in this type of housing just to give some clarification 60% of [ORGANIZATION] the building that I live in a single person  cannot make more than 50% or 60% of the [ORGANIZATION], which means for a person like myself, the maximum amount of money that I can make in order to continue to live in the housing that I live in is about $24,000. My [ORGANIZATION] is about $19,000.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And thank you for clarifying, because there's a lot of confusion. Unfortunately, I've come to find out that affordable housing has its own language, and it is not helpful. So these  it depends how many people in your household, and it's a threshold income.",portland
04_26_2017,homeless,"And so, and I'll just put that in context. An independent study was released recently saying we're short just under 2,[ADDRESS], who's been chronically homeless, and give them a fighting chance of being a successful tenant.",portland
04_26_2017,homeless,"And the best example of where we've had success, and I think Commissioner [PERSON] deserves a bow on this, is when we made a commitment as a city and a county to greatly reduce the amount of veterans who are homeless. And we had a very friendly tool then. We had something called a VASH voucher, and that was a federal voucher that provided a subsidy for the home and services.",portland
04_26_2017,housing crisis,"And so that's why I believe we should be spending more of our money with the county addressing people who are in poverty areas.  because it's going to cost us a lot more if we don't, and I think it's morally the right thing to do. The reason I will support the applications before us [ORGANIZATION] is that it turns out this housing crisis is impacting people across the income ladder. And if we don't have workforce housing or housing for working-class people, then shame on us.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"Okay. So it shows that affordable housing, you know, we lack 25,000 units of affordable housing, and we need to have all cylinders working. And the multi is an important cylinder.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"We need direct subsidies. We need the multi-program if we're going to really be serious about meeting our goals of affordable housing for the residents of our city. So this is great, and thank you for the good work.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And this really relates to what we just heard, this very successful and increasingly successful program to build affordable housing. And one of the problems is we ran up against the agreed-upon cap between the city and the county and the school district about how much revenue to forego [ORGANIZATION] in this cycle to make these multi-programs work. And what we're seeing now is an increasing number of multi-applications, and it makes sense to move towards a, rather than setting the cap [ORGANIZATION] at $1.5 million, I believe it was set at, of lost revenue, to come up with a rolling average over [LOCATION] not to exceed $15 million.",portland
04_26_2017,homeless,"And I can just think of a million things that [ORGANIZATION] could do with $30,000 besides police overtime and sweeping homeless people. Thank you. Thank you.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"There are two technical additions in this supplemental budget. The authorization of the housing capital fund is being undertaken by [ORGANIZATION]. That fund will be used to budget affordable housing capital project spending, largely related to the recently passed general obligation bond.",portland
04_26_2017,homeless,"It sounds like the only thing holding us up is a question that Commissioner [PERSON] has. And it's actually to address a concern that Commissioner [PERSON] raised during [ORGANIZATION] budget process, where we had a very narrow three to two vote that Commissioner [PERSON] and Mayor PERSON3 joined me in to allocate $350,000 to a project that had come out of [ORGANIZATION] to  do outreach on housing and homeless services. And Commissioner [PERSON] voted against it, saying that he was not confident that the money would go out to the community.",portland
04_26_2017,homeless,"And so since the request is now changed into two internal positions,  some of which seems primarily related to the work of [ORGANIZATION]. I'm wondering what council, and as I say, I would have hoped that Commissioner [PERSON] would have been part of this,  What council is thinking on that? Particularly, Mayor, you're looking at the office, creating an office of landlord and tenant services, and also you obviously are representative to the joint office.",portland
04_26_2017,homelessness,"We are turning $120,000 back to the general fund. We are trying to use these dollars to their absolute  best potential. And I'm not convinced that doling out grants to a variety of community groups to engage members in discussion about our homelessness issues is going to be effective or move not just the conversation forward but actual progress on the issue.",portland
04_26_2017,homelessness,"appropriate role of the joint office vis-a-vis the interests of the city of [ORGANIZATION]. We have lots and lots of interactions with neighborhood associations, with community organizations, with people in the community around not only solutions to homelessness, but also some of the manifestations of homelessness. Okay.  working with us to address abandoned campsites, working with us to address some of the issues around public health, public safety, environmental issues.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"We urge the city to support the recommendation to clarify the scope of design review doesn't include changes to base entitlements given by long-range planning and zoning, potentially reducing the number of homes in designated high-capacity areas. Thank you.  to better align development and design review process to lessen delays and costs, which can impact both availability and affordability.  to allow the type of review to be appropriate for the size of the project with clear and objective standards, to consider where outside the central city the D overlay may not be appropriate, and weigh its application carefully with potential impact on affordability where that is an issue. In particular, consider allowing non-profit developers and or affordable housing projects to meet a different set of clearly defined standards.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"We also encourage the City to consider that any limitations on entitlements and therefore new housing will, by virtue of the recently adopted [ORGANIZATION], also result in potential loss of permanently affordable housing in our most well-connected, amenity-rich areas. There are two recommendations by [ORGANIZATION] we also wanted to highlight, which is the great improvements to public process to increase inclusivity and our commitment to equity in the city, and differentiating between more intense central city and sub-districts and those less intense sub-districts to reflect the unique character of those neighborhoods. Lastly, we encourage the city to always consider the de-overlay criteria  any project really, in light of its long, of its stated long-range planning goals, namely the Climate Action Plan and the Comprehensive Plan's equity and anti-displacement goals.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"Okay. And then I'm rather struck when the consultant said that affordable housing was really tangential to this whole effort. Again, from my perspective, affordable housing was really the genesis of this whole effort.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"So what am I missing here? So we did have a sub-consultant working on the affordable housing aspect piece of it. And really, we were trying to set the framework for all of design review.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And as we've discussed, design review is a subset of  of development review in total. Unfortunately, we didn't delve as deep into affordable housing as we would have liked to. We certainly have in the [ORGANIZATION] process that Mayor [PERSON] and Commissioner [PERSON] have been discussing, and we've been delving deep into it in that respect.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And like [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, [ORGANIZATION] has looked at the recommendations to see what the effect would be on affordable housing and has some findings in there. That wasn't the genesis of the project though, was it? The charge to the consultant was not see how does our review affect affordable housing.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"Right. So the – I guess, you know, it's probably not in your contract, but I think the genesis for these discussions we've been having over [ORGANIZATION] have been related in part to affordable housing projects objecting, and maybe objecting is too strong a word, but having strong concerns about the time –  and expense of design review, the expense added to projects by design review. So I think, you know, if memory serves me correctly, and I'm not always the best on timelines, but there was certainly an axis of connection there.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"So we needed to settle that issue. That was one of the motivations for it. And then since then also, we've gone through the [ORGANIZATION] process and this whole idea of the cost that actually –  Early on, you had hearings of this with ORG1 here of what kind of role that permit processes play in the cost of affordable housing.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And I appreciated comments from a whole range of folks, even when there was tension or disagreement. I think these are really fascinating and vital issues that are coming up. And, of course, unsurprisingly, I'm also very concerned with how  we are impacting development, specifically development of affordable housing.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,"And I meant no disrespect for any of the commissions that are present [ORGANIZATION]. My example about concerns over design commission and affordable housing projects are as related to me as my term as housing commissioner. I'm not casting judgment one [STREET] or the other whether those concerns are legitimate or not, but nevertheless, those are concerns that I've heard and have talked with [ORGANIZATION] about and numerous other people as well.",portland
04_26_2017,affordable housing,I think that's one of the reasons that people come to [ORGANIZATION] is that we're not just saying slop anything up wherever you want to because we need more housing we're saying you can do both and that's as again what I've said [ORGANIZATION] throughout the process we were saying yes you may be taking more density and we're going to make sure that it fits in the context of the neighbourhood and that it's got  appropriate design and affordable housing does not have to be ugly housing.,portland

But we wanted to make sure to sell it not just to any other high bidder, but really to sell it to another non-profit affordable housing developer whose main focus was to develop and operate quality affordable and rentable housing and would have the financial capacity to continue to operate it the [STREET] we intended from the beginning.

03_04_2015,affordable housing,"And as several of you actually know very well because of your past involvement and even involvement on the board, in some cases in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] preserved hundreds of units of affordable housing in inner southeast [ORGANIZATION], and all that housing remains DATE2 affordable.

I helped change and inform the narrative of this conversation going forward because before I, originally when I first spoke with [ORGANIZATION]'s group, I had this impression that was kind of created just universally about what property management companies are.

04_03_2019,affordable housing,"As you can see, the mission statement says, we wanted to create clear channels to access housing of choice for all renters regardless of background that is consistent, fair and equitable and maintains dignity and humanity for the renter. With our workshops, we met with a large variety of impacted community members, including housing providers to negotiate the details. As you can see, we spent almost 55% of our time in workshop with private market and affordable housing providers, and there were significant improvements to our policy drafts because of it.",portland
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"Our second finding is that there is clear discrimination in affordability. So while property values and home prices are skyrocketing, average wages for people of color are going down. Because all or almost all of the city's neighborhoods are unaffordable to many people of color, we are reinforcing economic segregation through displacement and putting inordinate strain on affordable housing providers and their very limited housing stock.",portland

Additionally, [ORGANIZATION] found that justice-involved individuals are subject to public policies that impede successful reintegration into society, especially housing, leading to higher rates of recidivism and homelessness.",portland
04_03_2019,homelessness,"So in essence, we allow justice-involved individuals to continue to be punished even after they have served their time and posed on them by the justice system. The stigma of past incarceration continues to [STREET] public policies that either exacerbate or quietly allows a lack of access to fundamental resources, like housing, that enable them to contribute positively to society and avoid negative outcomes, like increased recidivism and homelessness. It's a vicious cycle of our own making.",portland
04_03_2019,homelessness,"There is literally no [STREET] for a renter to overcome the stigma of a previous eviction until they are given the opportunity to build a better rental history. It's a [DATE] that leads to homelessness. Instead, only specific patterns of recent behavior can accurately assess risk.",portland
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"This puts tremendous pressure on affordable housing provider resources as well as creates economic segregation that impacts people of color the most. Also, people who have Section 8 vouchers have extreme difficulty finding market rate housing they can afford, and at least 25% are forced to give the voucher back.  and at least half of all voucher holders are seniors and people with disabilities. We are recommending landlords cannot reject applicants who make at least two times the rent or at least two and a half times when three major utility costs are paid directly by the tenant.",portland
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"As you can see, the number of units available to people who make 60% [ORGANIZATION] or less is about half the number of people who need them. Lowering the income ratio allows us to ease some of this mismatch, which based on a previous map clearly demonstrates economic segregation, while also easing some of the resource burden put upon our limited affordable housing units. Okay, so let's talk about screening for barriers.",portland
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"And finally, the best part. I'm so excited to get to this moment. We wrapped up our development of this policy by conducting a beta test with affordable housing providers, market rate providers, legal advocates, and resource advocates.",portland
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"Rental history, again, will be a barrier for a substantial number of people who do not have a reported rental history for whatever reason. So in terms of looking at these outcomes, essentially what I've done is simulate the screening. Giving folks a sort of yes, no, we're an indeterminate across four policies this policy proposal the standard screening provided by a multi-family [ORGANIZATION] provided by another private industry group and one provided by central city concern to represent an affordable housing providers and  So, we looked at all tenants across all four policies and then tried to drill down on some specific groups of persons with issues or backgrounds that were flagged as having particular concern.",portland
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"The fair policy proposal in looking at outcomes looks most like, and in fact very similar to, central city concern as an affordable housing providers policy. So the kinds of practices of those providers would be similar to this policy. Overall, from one-third to one-half of the applicants with data in this data set are newly approved with the [ORGANIZATION] policy as compared to current industry standard operating procedure.",portland
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"similar to the kind of screening that happens with affordable housing providers now. Folks who are of course dedicated to providing access to folks with lower incomes. And this policy would increase the acceptance rate on the criteria of history, rental history barriers for people of color, low-income applicants and those with housing choice vouchers.",portland
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"And this policy is designed to increase housing access to fair housing protected classes that the beta test has demonstrated, time-saving.  that have time and again been proven to have less access to private market housing, for which market rate and affordable housing development will not meet the need in the near future. Number two, this policy does not limit a landlord's ability to screen people with criminal histories, as we've heard over and over. This is a twisted, fear-mongering tactic that has been used to scare people into thinking they are unsafe.",portland

04_03_2019,homelessness,She said this policy gives her hope because it will increase her chances of finding a [STREET] to live instead of potentially facing homelessness due to less choices. She has never had an [ORGANIZATION] filed against her for nonpayment of rent. I also want to point out an amazing feat of this long and arduous process.,portland
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"We do not believe this should prevent the [ORGANIZATION] from passing this policy in its attempt to address housing discrimination and economic and racial segregation. We do know  that the status quo does not work. Despite our best efforts to invest in housing access, affordable housing development, vouchers, et cetera, we cannot meet the volume of need that exists.",portland
04_03_2019,affordable housing,"Although this remains true for all of our members, the greatest impact in terms of cost and implementation will be shoulders by providers of affordable housing. While there were non-profit housing providers that participated in the beta testing, those were largely social service oriented organizations with dual missions of housing and supportive services. By the nature of their good work, these organizations already have screening criteria similar to or even less restrictive than the low barrier screening criteria recommended in Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposal and as such would not be impacted.",portland

While this council has put in [STREET] measures to catch people in crisis by increasing the time of notice for rent increases and no-cause evictions, [ORGANIZATION] we will need to maintain a proactive approach.",portland
04_13_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"This council will continue to need to address...  the long-term solutions that prevent homelessness, increase housing options available to individuals, and in turn, open doors of opportunity to our most economically vulnerable community members.

The final results of the Fair Housing Poll will be available [ORGANIZATION], and we'll be happy to share that with you. So, again, additional policies that might be helpful in addressing some of these housing crisis issues that we're experiencing right now, in addition to educating landlords, would be to implement inclusionary zoning, which I know the city is working on, to consider rent control and other incentive programs to include more affordable housing and high opportunities, and  You could consider instituting a landlord licensing program in order to consistently train all landlords and tenant landlord rights and responsibilities.",portland
04_13_2016,homeless,"Good morning. So I wanted to say, you know, I think it's good to reduce traffic deaths and stuff, but I also wanted to point out that [ORGANIZATION] is directly involved with killing homeless people by having homeless sweeps.  and coordinating a lot of the homeless sweeps so i'd like to see the uh same uh vision of zero deaths for homeless people and uh i think one of the ways that you could do that is by uh stopping a lot of the sweeps because uh sweeps are known for killing people and uh so i think it's kind of a  contradictory that, you know, that motorists and bicyclists and pedestrians are put on this pedestal of safety, but homeless people basically are being killed by these same agencies that are supposedly there to stop traffic fatalities and other stuff, you know?",portland
04_13_2016,homeless,"So I don't think that the police and police  [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and all these people should be conducting homeless sweeps and killing people, especially under a homeless state of emergency. And, you know, this is a – I just see one class of citizens and –  all these various groups that get protection, but I don't see the homeless. And you know what?",portland
04_13_2016,homeless,"The homeless are an all-encompassing group of people, which include every race, gender, you know, sexual preference, et cetera. So, you know, these homeless sweeps are still going on. They're being coordinated by the same people that are supposedly...  all interested in safety issues, you know.",portland
04_13_2016,homeless,"So basically I'm wondering if you guys are going to maybe tell [ORGANIZATION] to stop sweeping homeless people and killing them, because I'd like to see the same vision of zero deaths amongst the homeless that you guys are free to comment if you want. Thanks very much. Mr. [PERSON], I think you're next.",portland
04_13_2016,homelessness,"And those opportunity youth need an opportunity in this community. And for whatever reason, whether it be gang violence, homelessness, drug and alcohol, or just not being able to get along with your family and couch surfing in different places,  We have a very serious problem, a youth employment crisis, and not just the public. And we have stepped up in a big [STREET], Mayor.",portland
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"But when we allow apartment buildings to be built, that increases density, but we require the developer to pay [ORGANIZATION]s. And we have [ORGANIZATION] waivers for affordable housing, but we require that the housing actually be affordable. Okay.",portland
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"So for me, because we're talking about the backward-looking effect of waiving SDCs for utilities, I think it's very important to identify what's the public benefit because we are doing a little bit of cost shifting. I believe that when we waive SDCs for affordable housing with regulatory agreements, there's a clear public interest that's obtained and it's enforceable. I was persuaded during the recession that bringing an illegal industry out into the sunshine and making it conform to our building code and incentivizing them was laudable.",portland
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"Our research showing the low carbon footprints of small dwellings has led us to support [ORGANIZATION] through zoning codes, building codes, financing, appraisals, tours, and survey research. Our [ORGANIZATION] survey research showed that ORG1 owners in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION] showed that over 80% of these ORG1 owners are providing long-term housing with their accessory dwelling units. Additionally, the survey demonstrated that approximately 16% are providing free or affordable housing with rents below $500 per month.",portland
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"and I think the affordable ish affordable housing issue that's under discussion here kind of meets that criteria what was striking and just looking at the ordinance language was kind of lack of data and  lack of information on enforcement and how to ensure accountability. So I think it's not only meeting a clear and important, you know, goal and benefit for the city, but, you know, just having it, having there be some meat to it, you know, some teeth to it. And then third, to keep in mind the bigger picture, right?",portland
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"Mr. [PERSON], you're next. So...  I'm all for affordable housing and affordable dwelling units and all that, but I hear a lot about affordable housing, affordable housing, this, that, and the other thing all the time. But the reality of the situation is people cannot afford housing whether it's so-called affordable or not.",portland
04_13_2016,homeless,And there's homeless people that are falling through the cracks. You have an ongoing war against the homeless in this town. There's all these zombie houses you guys are all talking about now.,portland
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"And now they actually own the building. And this was an occupied space that...  community activists and artists and community members took over and revived on their own. So, you know, I'd like to see you guys move beyond just talking about affordable housing.",portland
04_13_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"And when you do talk about affordable housing, actually talk about it being not so affordable for a lot of people. And  Until there actually is affordable housing, maybe we can establish some more homeless camps or rest areas or other places. And for a start, we could take over a couple of these zombie houses and turn them into a community resource that actually benefits homeless people.",portland
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"And it's the perfect kind of affordable housing to slip in discreetly into existing neighborhoods, where it's hard to build any housing. On the short-term rental side –  [ORGANIZATION] obviously has a compliance and enforcement issue on short-term rentals. But the biggest problem is single-family homes being decommissioned and being taken out of the housing market.",portland
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"she's had to leave but  uh she's taken very seriously the concerns uh that were very evident [ORGANIZATION] when hundreds of people came to [ORGANIZATION] to talk about the huge problem our community is having with low income and affordable housing um [ORGANIZATION] our answer i think that given the amounts of money we're talking about and the extreme need it would be appropriate for you to make this last for [LOCATION] unfortunately this housing state of emergency  Hopefully, we'll be better in [LOCATION], but given the 20s plus thousand of low-income and median-income people that are housing distressed right now, we're not going to be looking at a beautiful world [LOCATION] from now where this isn't going to need work. So I think you can feel safe about leaving the original language for a [ORGANIZATION] waiver.",portland
04_13_2016,homeless,"So we need to open up the public forum with legislatures, city and county commissioners, working to incentivize [ORGANIZATION]s that provide low-income housing. And for people who choose to use an [ORGANIZATION] or a private home as an ORG1, we need to really accelerate our efforts to get [ORGANIZATION]s  fair, effective taxation to make those high-profit properties provide public services for the most distressed units. I know that that's a difficult conversation, but in the housing emergency, I think that many of the tens of thousands of low-income people have not heard enough real numbers and statistics, except for the 600 coming [INSTITUTION] beds,  about what we can do for people who are extremely rent-distressed and the numbers of people that – how many people – we still don't have the information from Administrative Judge, Chief Judge [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] system about how many people are really getting evictions and finding themselves stuck on the streets.",portland
04_13_2016,affordable housing,And I also appreciate Commissioner [PERSON]'s continuing efforts to ensure that we have a supply of affordable housing. All right. I think the remaining piece that needs to be figured out is the short-term rental piece and also new construction.,portland
04_13_2016,affordable housing,"And again, I'm going to thank many of the staff who were involved in it. We did carve out the exemption for affordable housing and potentially at the expense of large trees, and that is a policy choice that the council has made. There are many issues involving the tree code that need to be addressed sooner rather than later.",portland

Right. But if somebody came to work at the city because they're interested in homeless issues and then they got a job at the county working on homeless issues and occasionally they were lobbying the city on how to address homeless issues, I don't think the public would be upset about that at all.",portland

02_28_2018,affordable housing,"For instance, a family of two would be making less than $20,000 a year to qualify for a deeply affordable unit under the housing bond. 300 units will be set aside for individuals and families that require supportive housing, and 650 units will be sized for families. I wanted to also give you a little update on the progress that we have under the affordable housing bond.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"To date, we've acquired the [ORGANIZATION] apartment complex, converting 263 apartments into permanent housing. We have purchased a site at [ORGANIZATION] and FAC1 for the development of an estimated 200 new units.

02_28_2018,affordable housing,"I was trying to create a house, but it didn't quite come out the [STREET] it intended. So in practice, we will use our framework and the policies developed with our community and our bond oversight committee for the foundation of all of this work.

PERSON0, before you move off that slide.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So that's one category. Another model is how we finance affordable housing development, where we put public resources in, but the nonprofit developer, sometimes for-profit, but mostly nonprofit developer, has an asset management, property management agreement. So complaints from tenants go to the nonprofit.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Yes. And I think the city only has two affordable housing developments under city lights where we're the owner. So now we're the owner, and we're delegating to [ORGANIZATION] this function of asset management.",portland

02_28_2018,homeless,I also appreciate the fact that it was pointed out yet again that it is the federal government's responsibility and that people can move here and people become homeless here.  or are at danger of losing their housing because of factors that are beyond the control of the city council.

02_28_2018,affordable housing,And I think we need a little less character building and a little more investment in affordable housing if we're going to solve this crisis. I just cannot believe it. [ORGANIZATION] would be turning in his grave if he was listening to this discussion.,portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Commissioner, I don't have a second amendment but I just want to put it on the table there that I think that as we go to implementing these pieces we are going to need to think about how do we encourage  individuals and groups to move out of spaces when they become successful. I know that we found this with affordable housing, that we don't necessarily have appropriate checks and balances so that once an organization is established and thriving, there needs to be an incentive to them to move somewhere so that the next generation of new makers and...  artists can move into that property. And so I think throughout the recommendations, that will happen through the implementation phase.",portland

And so to finalize, I just want to say thank you, and thank you to everybody who is here and lending their voices so strongly in support of keeping the creative heart of [ORGANIZATION] that has brought so many here.

We are not responsible for creating that policy, but we are responsible for the remedy, and this is part of it.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So those are some of the larger modifications that don't relate to the exemptions. Again, looking at the exemptions, just to kind of go through really quick, the single-unit exemption was eliminated, and there are 11 exemptions in here.

02_28_2018,affordable housing,"And, you know, most regulated affordable housing is exempt anyway, given the provisions in the lease about having to make only a certain amount of money.

Relocation assistance also helps to increase the likelihood of successful relocation for tenants in unexpected crisis. Involuntary displacement due to a rent increase or no-cause termination can not only be anxiety-provoking and create homelessness or transience, but it creates a situation where sometimes they're not able to relocate and they end up on our streets.",portland

Um, first our city and community have expressed a commitment to supporting those most impacted by the housing crisis and the city, um, has boldly claimed equity goals.

02_28_2018,affordable housing,"If anyone needs relocation the most, even in nuanced circumstances, it is this population. Due to severe shortage of affordable housing that is both regulated and market rate, when families are displaced from affordable housing, they most often have to relocate to market rate housing, or they end up on the streets or end up on the couches, often sometimes ending up on waiting lists that can be [ORGANIZATION]. Relocation payments are critical in these scenarios as they are the least likely population to be able to save for an unexpected displacement event and are already scraping by.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"As advocates for this population for [ORGANIZATION], we know that exempting them from support during voluntary displacement could be one of the biggest mistakes we make as a city. [ORGANIZATION] never talked about a straight exemption, and we talked through different nuances or different circumstances in which there should be or could be additional support. So [PERSON] is requesting that this language be stricken from the code, and we specifically request that council mandate ORG2 to take up the issue with local affordable housing providers to talk through this more nuanced language that addresses the issues highlighted in ORG3 during deliberation in [LOCATION].  around federal changes, rent changes, income changes, and more.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"I think we're talking about a number of groups. And in transparency, I emailed some of these affordable housing providers to let them know that we would be taking this position. And one indicated interest in engaging in this process of talking with [ORGANIZATION] to develop this nuanced language.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"What I can share with you is that we have had several members within [ORGANIZATION] who have received rent increases and regulated affordable housing that has caused a displacing event that forced them to relocate into private market housing. So we have seen it on the ground, and it is very distressing. Some folks...",portland
02_28_2018,homeless,"I believe one person that I can think of off the top of my head did end up homeless. Yeah. And one of the scenarios that we're trying to avoid is in a circumstance where there is an actual income restriction, and that's not always the case.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"When the household income exceeds that restricted level, they either have to move out or the nonprofit affordable housing organization  property manager loses the tax exemption on that property. So that's a scenario where I think an exemption makes sense because it would be a burden to that housing provider  There are definitely some nuanced situations in which I think exemptions are appropriate, but there are some others that a flat exemption does not include in which relocation would be extremely necessary. Okay.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,And so that's why we're recommending that [ORGANIZATION] take this up with affordable housing providers to talk through those and include it in the language. Great. Thank you.,portland
02_28_2018,housing crisis,That's my practice area. Okay. I've seen from working with clients directly the devastating impact that the housing crisis has had on the most vulnerable members of our community.,portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Why don't you come on up? I guess I'm inclined to want to delete the exemption that relates to  Dwelling unit regulated as affordable housing by a federal, state, or local government. for a period of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So the regulated affordable housing is actually regulated on an attendance income level, and it's allowed to go up based on the MFIs and a number of different things in a regulatory agreement. We don't think that it's a significant factor and that this amendment is actually necessary. However, our affordable housing partners are extremely concerned about the removal of this amendment and quite frankly have some concerns about the length and duration of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,We don't necessarily regulate all of the affordable housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. Much of it was created by the city. created before the [ORGANIZATION] requirement happened.,portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"I'm particularly thinking of some properties with [ORGANIZATION] contracts, et cetera, that may be owned by a partner like ORG1. It's clearly a policy choice by this council, but it is something that our folks in the community who are providing affordable housing in partnership with the city are extremely concerned that this is –  I believe the removal would be problematic for them, and that's what I can... Don't these entities issue no-cause evictions?",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] would definitely be included, but it would be any regulated affordable housing as long as it was affordable for a period of [ORGANIZATION]. But that would include many of [ORGANIZATION]'s units as well as many other affordable housing providers in the community. Like nonprofit providers?",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So, yes, you could have a scenario where somebody is earning very little money. Maybe they're working part-time and they're in regulated affordable housing, or maybe they're not working at all. And so the subsidy that is helping them stay in the rental unit is covering most of the housing cost.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"And then when they see a significant increase in their income, their lease agreement should—and  Again, I don't know what all of the lease agreements say between the providers of affordable housing. We don't have a full list. compilation of all the terms of the lease agreement, but in that scenario they would have to pay 30% of their [ORGANIZATION] income toward rent.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"And that could be a significant increase, but that is the policy framework under which a lot of affordable housing with subsidy built in is regulated. And then there's the other scenario that I already mentioned, which is that the income goes up so much that they no longer qualify for  for the subsidy in that housing provider would either have to pay RELO or they would lose their tax-exempt status. Those are two scenarios that I think are reasonable for us to want to avoid.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"That is another scenario where we need to – I mean, the virtue of regulated units is that once individuals are making enough money, that we can move a new family in. We have a deficit of 23,000 affordable housing units in the city. And so part of this, that was that sense of, well, as people can earn income and move into the private market, we need – this is what we heard from some of the affordable housing providers.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"Is it an urgent issue that needs to be resolved [TIME] without the benefit of a lot of information? Or can we choose either to keep it in or keep it out and come back with some feedback from our affordable housing partners to better understand the issue? Because I have a feeling – Yeah, and that was my proposed amendment.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So what's the harm in taking it out altogether and just putting a [ORGANIZATION] clock on bringing back something that we can all understand that's tailored to the situation that our nonprofit and federal partners have raised? That is an option that is available to you. I will, again, reiterate just from the affordable housing partners I talked to, they are very concerned about this provision.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,And our intent was the [ORGANIZATION] policy was not to cover those shorter-term durations of  things that are the DATE1 tax exemptions that the city gives or otherwise. The intent was for long-term committed affordable housing providers. And so even this was a compromise that our providers are not particularly pleased with.,portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"But let's face it, there's also a lot of landlords that have been out there providing affordable housing for a long time too. And we're sort of saying...  We're going to not be so concerned about what the policies and practices of the nonprofits as we are with the for-hire or for-profits. So I think it's fair to strike it and educate us all about it because it is – we obviously need more education about the issue here.",portland
02_28_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"In my opinion, this proposal is not a win-win solution to a housing crisis that we face. It's not a win-lose issue for either tenants' rights, affordable housing advocates, or landlords. In my opinion, this proposal is a lose-lose issue that negatively affects all small landlords and tenants in [ORGANIZATION] combined.",portland
02_28_2018,housing crisis,"I am here [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION], to urge your support for the mandatory relocation assistance that ensures all renters are permanently protected from forced displacement.

02_28_2018,homeless,Three women did help me out and I was appreciative of this. I am homeless right now because of not getting relocation assistance. I am homeless now because of bigotry and there are landlords out there that  are not using the law.,portland

[ORGANIZATION] is a good beginning, but our rental housing crisis and our unequal tenant-landlord relationship demands additional protections. I am...  I'm going to talk about my experiences with maintenance and the safety of the homes that some of these landlords fail to do.",portland
02_28_2018,affordable housing,"So we provide safe, stable, and affordable housing for people that are evicted. And I don't worry about that when I'm dealing with these people that are in recovery. For me to have to worry about a relocation fee when there is a problem with recovery, it's an issue for all of us, and it does affect my business greatly.",portland

The members of my union adopted as official union policy an acknowledgment that there is a housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION], that this is clearly a working family issue, which especially presents a hardship to low-income workers, and that this crisis needs immediate and meaningful solutions, including better protection of tenants' rights and welfare. The fact that there's a longstanding housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION] means that the current system of providing housing to our city's population is inadequate.",portland

02_28_2018,homeless,"But boy, it would sure be easier to just sort of do it once and be done. The other thing is, I have a homeless guy living...  sheltering himself in my garage, since my garage would be considered, in quotes, uninhabitable.

05_25_2017,affordable housing,"If a tenant is opting for additional services such as a pet fee, an additional parking stall, or storage, that's also not the landlord increasing the rent. And lastly, we flagged that...  Affordable housing and regulated affordable housing have limited applicability under relocation assistance, mostly because usually the federal, state, or local level is setting the income eligibility and the maximum rent that can be charged under those situations. So technically it would not be the landlord increasing the rent up to that 10%.",portland
05_25_2017,homelessness,"So in a sense, it did provide support for mitigating the impact of no-cause evictions. In terms of, I think it's a little bit too premature to see if there was any long-term effect, whether it increased the housing stability of families or prevented families from moving into homelessness, because obviously the cost of moving is really, really high. And a lot of families, particularly the families that we work with and serve, still face very high barriers to getting into housing and maintaining housing in terms of financial perspective.",portland

We're talking about families that could potentially be homeless if they don't receive relocation assistance versus an organization or a landlord keeping with accounting procedures or operations.

While we agree that tenants could use [ORGANIZATION] by which to decide if they can absorb a rent increase,  Giving the landlords additional time as suggested creates a situation where a tenant might not receive relocation until they are [LOCATION] into a DATE2 notice period.

05_24_2017,homeless,"But regular shelters don't offer that, and that has to change, because everyone deserves to have a roof over their head and some education. In conclusion, we have come up with a couple of solutions to help get homeless people off the streets. Our first solution is to simply get more family shelters in [ORGANIZATION].",portland

And I'm confident that with the improved working relationship between ORG1 and ORG2, that this requirement can be utilized to push hard on developers to save trees.",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"But this says the director of [ORGANIZATION] is adopting the rules. If need be in the real world, basically as it works now, you have to go to [ORGANIZATION] to get your [ORGANIZATION] exemption, and you also need to go to ORG1 to get your permits and your tree, obviously all your permits. They work together, and they basically meet now [ORGANIZATION] to talk about affordable housing projects, and these can easily pop up in those meetings as, hey, we have a developer trying to get the [ORGANIZATION] exemption as well as the tree exemption.",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"I'm very impressed with the work that's been done so far, and I really don't have anything negative to say other than we can bring down the cost for the developers and the builders and the homeowners, and that's one of the ways to do that. One [STREET] to do that is to not make people fence things that really don't need to be fenced. In terms of the stopgap of Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendment, though, you're in favor of not requiring trees to be preserved on affordable housing sites?",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"I think that when you build affordable housing, it's extremely hard to get anybody to build affordable housing anyway. I think you know that. Unless, of course, it's financed by the city for the most part, whether it's through our own sort of inclusionary zoning non-rules or not.",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"It's very hard to build affordable housing affordably. And so anything that you can do to mitigate those costs, whether it's replacing sidewalks, trees at the sidewalks, or any other thing that you can do to make it more affordable for developers to come in and build affordable housing, yeah, I think it's a good idea. And if the city can help pay to bring new trees in, then yeah.",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"So first of all, I was very concerned. It's not in the letter, but [ORGANIZATION] was raised to you as a reason why we need to exempt affordable housing from the ORG1 charges or that we need to have no policy unlike the proposal from ORG2. I looked at what we gained and lost in that project.",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"So what we gained was we gained seven affordable housing units. What we lost was 2 million gallons of stormwater and all the other issues. So...  Finally, looking at the site plan, trees are cut not for building square footage but for our surface parking lot.",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"That's why we thought we need to have perhaps a look at these because in some cases a large multi-dwelling project with many affordable housing units, you just can't have both. You can't save the trees and have the housing. It's clear.",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"This –  The new [ORGANIZATION] rules could require, as [ORGANIZATION] alluded to, something very much along the lines of a competent city official having a quick discussion. So I do feel that there's a workable solution. I just am concerned that the council not feel compelled to, A, underestimate what we're losing by cutting these trees, and, B, thinking that it's trees versus affordable housing.",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"And I thought, we thought it was a little bit...  more onerous and expensive for developers of affordable housing, and it could result in them not being able to build the affordable housing that is so necessary. I mean, we're very glib about saying nobody favors tradeoffs, but, you know, reality requires some tradeoffs. And right now we lack 34,000 units of affordable housing in this city, and so –  I'm trying to make sure, I'm trying to strike a compromise here that will allow affordable housing to be constructed without gumming up the work so much that people throw up their hands and say, forget it.",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"How many affordable housing units are we expecting on single-family lots? This applies to multifamily as well, but I don't have that number. This isn't just single-family lots.",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"I don't know. It sounds quite complicated. I do want to say that I have some real concerns about exempting  affordable housing from the tree code of requirements for many of the same reasons that [ORGANIZATION] and a couple of the people on the committee, I think it was [PERSON], mentioned an equity issue.",portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,Many of the affordable housing units are being built in and near low-income neighborhoods. Yes. these neighborhoods have fewer trees to start with.,portland
03_30_2016,affordable housing,"I have some real problems with a number of those things, but the exemption of public property or public bureaus, the exemption of the affordable housing, the exemption of the site. I don't like seeing the exemption of all the [STREET] right-of-ways as a flat-out exemption. I think there are a lot of cases where sidewalks can be designed in different ways.",portland

03_28_2018,affordable housing,"To support [ORGANIZATION]. Colleagues, in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] directed [PERSON] and ORG2 to develop an equitable housing strategy to address potential displacement and housing choices in anticipation of a proposed light rail line along the [ORGANIZATION].

04_11_2018,homeless,"Thank you, sir. So I will respond. First of all, we invest heavily, and as I will say in my speech [ORGANIZATION], record amounts in homeless prevention.",portland
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"We made record investments [ORGANIZATION] in housing, and lower-income housing I will –  say [PERSON], and I will show the facts on the screen behind me, we actually delivered record affordable housing [ORGANIZATION], and we're on track DATE2 to do it again. With regard to suites specifically, it is a very rare circumstance during my administration where we actually move somebody out of a campsite. We have a priority list based on either housing  environmental issues, public health issues, or public safety issues.",portland
04_11_2018,homeless,"The whole village got swept. There are 60,000 homeless people in [ORGANIZATION], and they're investing a billion and a half. I didn't say the problem's solved.",portland
04_11_2018,homelessness,"The reality is with more housing comes more cars and a need for more room for cars which includes off [STREET] parking to store them when not in use. Without more places for cars, more conflicts will occur and more people will be hurt. One of the failures of the political oratory and agenda is not initiating a discussion connecting population growth with homelessness, poverty, climate change, sustainability and yes, congestion and [ORGANIZATION]  For everybody's health and safety, a continuing conversation needs to take a [STREET] about how to start managing population growth, preferably with the public voluntarily accepting smaller families.",portland

One of the recent deaths on this section of the [STREET]...  was of a woman who was trying to cross safely in a designated crosswalk but was struck by a vehicle.

04_11_2018,housing crisis,"We were able to immediately file a request for a hearing, get back into [STREET], and negotiate a new agreement that allowed the tenant to stay in their housing and obtain the vital treatment they needed in order to maintain their sobriety. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not underline how the housing crisis [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] is the most pressing fair housing issue that we face. Through numerous cases that [ORGANIZATION] has handled representing large number of tenants in building-wide displacements or exorbitant rent increases, we have seen how the housing crisis is resulting in the wholesale displacement of communities of color.",portland
04_11_2018,housing crisis,"Through these cases, we have also seen how the housing crisis is reinforcing familiar patterns of housing segregation. In addition, landlords are utilizing more stringent screening criteria that make it nearly impossible for communities of color and individuals with disabilities to live anywhere in our city. This is an area ripe for disparate impact litigation.",portland
04_11_2018,housing crisis,The obligation of the Fair Housing Act command that equity and fair housing be the center of any analysis of policy initiatives aimed at addressing the housing crisis. We owe this to every member of our protected classes in our city. Thank you.,portland
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"These tenants often struggle to find and keep affordable housing. facing housing discrimination against families and recent immigrants. My colleague at [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], will be sharing a story from her community.",portland
04_11_2018,homelessness,"Programs require their participants to meet the federal definition of homelessness, thus bearing Native community members to do communal culture where community members may be doubled up with friends or family. Indeed, it has been observed that information management database reports show that the community-wide effort to fight homelessness simply does not know much about the Native American community. Assessment tools give a profound lack of regard for any community member's specific tribe, and [ORGANIZATION] has grouped the community together as all Native American, American Indian, and [PERSON].",portland

04_11_2018,affordable housing,"This bonus offers additional floor area and height for projects that provide affordable commercial space, and [ORGANIZATION] is working on administrative rules and will be the administrator of this bonus. And what we're doing here is amending a section of the zoning code to clarify for implementation how the affordable commercial bonus would work vis-a-vis the inclusionary housing bonus, which is also in the code, so that there's some clarity about what types of projects would access bonuses through which [STREET]. And the proposal is that in the code of 100 projects that were 100% residential projects  but weren't triggering [ORGANIZATION] because they're not hitting that 20 units threshold, would go to the inclusionary housing program and either build housing units or make a contribution to the affordable housing fund in order to gain additional FAR.",portland
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"So if a project wanted to utilize the full floor area allowed on the site, they would have to actually use affordable commercial and affordable housing opportunity to get there. And then finally, for mixed-use projects, so these projects would include residential and commercial, that would like to gain bonus floor area, they can do so by either providing voluntary affordable housing units on-site, by building on-site affordable commercial space, or by first making a payment to [ORGANIZATION] up to the maximum limit that they can, which again is half of the maximum, and then turning to the housing fund for the rest of that. The other clarification here is that we're clarifying in the code that the affordable commercial space bonus, as it's structured right now, if you build space on site, the return is two square feet of bonus floor area for every one square foot of space provided.",portland
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"There's a slight incentive to provide it on site, much like the housing is structured to provide an incentive to do it on site. But clarifying that if you're purchasing floor area via the –  affordable commercial space fund, the ratio is one square foot per the dollar figure. And those figures are preliminarily set to be the same as the affordable housing figures administered by [ORGANIZATION].",portland
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"And the one that...  called out to me, some [ORGANIZATION] members were uncomfortable with the idea of making fee in lieu payments available as an option for voluntary programs to boost floor area ratio. They questioned why funds raised in this matter based on in lieu payment would be sole source to a particular city bureau when there might be alternative uses for such funds that would more directly mitigate impacts of the allowed floor area ratio, for instance parking management programs, [STREET] trees or whatever. It just kind of called out to me that for the inclusionary housing, we have ORG1 that has an affordable housing bond that is in charge of looking at how do we do affordable housing.",portland
04_11_2018,affordable housing,"And so it's clear for that that the [ORGANIZATION] is going to then benefit affordable housing. For this commercial program, we don't have a mechanism currently for [ORGANIZATION] to find other alternative spaces. Okay.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"Right. And for those watching at home who may not have access to, well, who don't have access to this document, the three that are not being proposed to be adopted on consent are a set of action items for affordable housing, specifying pretty much our current policy, one to the  remove [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] from the interagency team proposed to provide coordinated environmental permit reviews streamlining, and then also to delete an action item from this [ORGANIZATION] section because it's the same as one in the [PERSON] section. All right.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,Thank you for that warning. You can put a little piece of tape over the –  So the language there crosses out the words or provision of greenway enhancements. But is that because we're not any longer going to consider greenway enhancements or because they're otherwise covered?  Because I thought the discussion that we had last time was talking about affordable housing as the main reason for doing bonuses and [ORGANIZATION] historic resources a secondary one to me the [ORGANIZATION] issues are not related should not be related to the height bonuses,portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"The new item A is directing us to come back to you all with a sort of a economically tested and redesigned bonus system that puts priority on affordable housing,  historic preservation and public open space. And seismic. And seismic.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I mean, if we want to focus on affordable housing and preservation and seismic, aren't we –  Is this amendment? Yeah, we're going to. No, no, it's actually, we're bringing back the results of the analysis in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"And also part of that is when we come back for the entire central city plan, I think what we want to be able to do is put the three or four –  a key potential bonus, and have you had that real discussion about which one is most important that you really want to focus on? Do you want to just have that? Do you want to have a point system like some cities have where if affordable housing is the most important?  It gets more points, per se, than the FAC0 or something else.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"The height should be for something that benefits that particular property, not that particular area. And it should be for affordable housing or historic preservation. And that's it.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"But it also could be the affordable housing bonus, and we'll bring that package back that you can consider it. But what [ORGANIZATION] and our stakeholders were interested in is finding a [STREET] –  a [STREET] to preserve the smaller buildings that are part of the character of the FAC0. And so the commissioner in [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposed amendment, is consistent with that point of view.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"How does removing the residential requirement comply with our current comprehensive plan policy of no net loss of housing? Well, there's two no net loss of housing policies. One is the affordable housing no net loss, and that's not the one you're referring to.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"It's the citywide no net loss of housing policy. In the proposed comprehensive plan, we are not continuing that policy because the  Not the affordable housing no net loss. There's a mandate that you can't change zoning out in the neighborhoods from one zone to another It comp the no net loss of housing policy that I believe you're referring to commissioner is a Man it comes from Metro  It doesn't count our mixed-use zone as a legitimate [STREET] to provide residential development.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"Not, it doesn't deal with the abstract notion about where we may be developing housing in the future. It's the existing inventory of affordable housing. So we need to – I wasn't aware that we were going to be doing away with current comprehensive plan policies in this particular part of the process.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,so this just clarifies that so we're fully supportive of this action uh if [ORGANIZATION] would like to uh discuss it that would be fine if it's consent okay well i guess uh i guess i don't recall publicly open or publicly accessible open space being one of the things that we were discussing in the spirit of narrowing the focus of our bonuses i mean i think affordable housing seismic and historic preservation were what i had in mind okay,portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"It sounds like you're saying this is something you want to assess as to whether it's a viable bonus. But I think you're likely to hear from us that we want to,  narrow the range of bonus linkages and give higher priority to affordable housing. So are we talking –  Is there any daylight between us or can you direct us out?",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"Yes, so they're both before us. Okay. I strongly support Commissioner [PERSON]'s amendment for zoning tools to allow height increases other than on the waterfront, only for preservation of historic properties and affordable housing.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,I'm very concerned about the height limits. bonus provisions and bonus transfer system supported by the current draft plan in many respects i think many of these problems continue especially as it relates to FAC0 particularly the 25 to 25 about 25 block area east of FAC1 and a few blocks immediately west of the stadium which were talked about earlier today friends of FAC0 strongly supports commissioner amendments  commissioner [ORGANIZATION]'s amendments [DATE] and 43 removing height bonuses over certain historic neighboring areas in the [ORGANIZATION] only allowing height increases above existing levels for historic preservation and affordable housing so we agree with this,portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"but we'd like to see a similar amendment for goose hollow which does not currently exist in the draft  [ORGANIZATION] supported the removal of height bonuses in [ORGANIZATION], consistent with 80% of the ORG1 members at the [ORGANIZATION] meeting, special meeting. We voted for height bonuses to be removed in [ORGANIZATION]. If the council decides not to remove all height bonuses, [ORGANIZATION] requests ORG2 to at least allow height increase bonuses only for historic preservation and for affordable housing.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,So I just want you to consider if there's a [STREET] to deal with that issue because we did not come before you last time and say we want [ORGANIZATION] with no residential. On [DATE].  I wholeheartedly support Commissioner [PERSON]'s call for removing bonuses from [ORGANIZATION] and lowering height limits to 100 or keeping height limits at 100 and only allowing height increases for historic preservation transfers and affordable housing. These are great ideas and creative ways to preserve our incredible historic architecture.,portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I was disappointed to see no similar protection of historic buildings in [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]. My personal opinion is to support removing bonuses in [ORGANIZATION], as the [ORGANIZATION] membership vote of 80% wanted bonuses removed. However, if bonuses are not removed, then it seems like a smart idea to allow height increases only through historic preservation and affordable housing bonuses.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I'm on the board of [ORGANIZATION], but I'm only speaking for myself [ORGANIZATION]. I want to thank Commissioner [PERSON] for her suggestion in Amendments 42 and [DATE] that the ORG1 receive increased heights only for historic preservation and affordable housing, and bonuses are removed in some areas. I support removing [ORGANIZATION] bonuses, just like 80% of the voters in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"39, preserving step down to the [ORGANIZATION] and to the extent that you're removing bonuses only for preservation and affordable housing is outstanding, and we're very supportive of that. to the extent that this proposal seems to increase the height limit in the historic district. I'm looking at the map at the very end of this long sheet here.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I'm a member of [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION]. Amendment 43 for the ORG2,  would only allow height increases for historic preservation and affordable housing. I support that for them because we would want that at least for [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,So I guess that's been resolved in the historic area. But some concerns about the bonus linkage. And could you again walk us through why we want to have the bonus linked to something more than preservation of affordable housing?,portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I called it [ORGANIZATION], LOC1LOC2[PERSON] is apt as well. And the notion there is greater heights –  but only accessible through benefit to historic or smaller properties in the [PERSON] to preserve those. [ORGANIZATION] has also made it clear by Action A in the new list that the provision of affordable housing needs to be considered in that whole package, and we're going to bring that whole package back.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"PERSON0? Well, I particularly appreciate the work that's been conducted by [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and I think virtually all of the offices around here about the importance of narrowing our bonuses down to, you know, if I had my drugs it would be simply affordable housing, but I understand affordable housing, historic preservation,  uh are also very important seismic issues as well but we really need to take the bold steps",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"A skyline defines a city, and there's nothing to be ashamed about a skyline. And secondly, it is because I want to see that height result in additional affordable housing, affordable to people, and people can live and work in our downtown. So these are issues why I come to the support of these amendments, or I should say maybe in opposition to some of the amendments that were put forward.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,And the proposed amendment would scratch the FAC0 piece and also limit the transfer eligible things to consider to be preservation or affordable housing. I apologize. I was confused.,portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,We recommend development of zoning tools that would allow increased height in exchange for greenway enhancements along the waterfront. We just want to explore it. the principle that commissioner [ORGANIZATION] has put out there is that bonus or no bonus it's not a step down to the river and it's not acceptable that's sort of your argument if we are to include it we'd still like to consider the greenway enhancements as one of the ways to get there and also acknowledge that when we bring that whole package back to you it may not be a [STREET] to get to the additional you may want to just use all that for affordable housing or some other purpose but we would still  planning to explore the economics of it.,portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"So an enhanced greenway, if it's a more shaded greenway with massive buildings over it, really isn't a good trade. And speaking to Commissioner [PERSON]'s point, we should be really focusing on affordable housing as the main reason to have the bonus. That was a brilliant suggestion that you came up with.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"This is – you know, the reason I didn't support the request of [ORGANIZATION] and others and [PERSON] to lower the heights  is because I think people have a reasonable expectation when they buy a property that the zoning is the zoning and the height expectation is the height expectation. This proposal would give additional height. And I think we need to be really clear to the [ORGANIZATION] now, no, we really are talking about historic preservation and affordable housing.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"The other bonus is, you know, the FAC0, I've still got to figure out how we're going to fund that, but it's not a good trade to have a much taller building next to the FAC0 in order to have a nicer FAC0. so i'll just i'll just chime in i i support the increased height uh again for what i said earlier i want to get the affordable housing um i'm skeptical about the greenway bonus too",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"but i'm deferring to [ORGANIZATION] and in saying you know give us a chance to at least look at it and and i know that study is underway right now so that's kind of why i'm i would oppose the amendment so what did the the action item as is doesn't have affordable housing in it  If I could offer, there's two decision points, and actually there's really just one.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"And then two, what bonus would you even consider for an increase like that? And what we have heard clearly, and you actually adopted in that additional amendment about the bonus system, is that it goes affordable housing, historic, seismic, open space, and we're going to come back with you all and talk about all those. This FAC0 tradeoff in my book is sitting there in the open space bundle of that policy that you adopted to tell us how to redesign the bonus system.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"No, I mean, I think if there's bonus there [ORGANIZATION], we can look at reprogramming the [STREET] that you get an existing bonus provision. We don't have to do this to get the affordable housing bonus. No, it's an additional tool.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"And to add affordable housing? Yeah. It does add affordable housing in this particular reference, which we're supportive of.",portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,So you think A has captured the affordable housing issue because it says so? I think A tells us what to do with the bonus system. All right.  all right now i understand so that's why now you would oppose this amendment,portland
03_05_2015,affordable housing,"I also want to thank [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], the...  ORG2 members and people on my staff who labored through these documents and I know that we will be coming back in [ORGANIZATION] with the study about the affordable housing bonuses and I look forward to a good discussion and hopefully Aggressive movement on that and I feel I feel good that we're going to get those affordable housing bonuses in [STREET] in time",portland
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"I'm PERSON0. And first of all, I just want to start with another item. I believe the Mayor and the [ORGANIZATION] members have received testimony on [ORGANIZATION] and the need to have ORG2 follow through with their signed commitment to create housing for 300 affordable housing units.",portland
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"Cascadia High Speed Rail Concept Plan relieves bottlenecks on all these corridors, on FAC0, FAC1, and FAC2. Connected TODs with park and kiss-and-rides could be very effective in relieving a [STREET] for affordable housing and market rate housing. [TIME] to FAC3 from [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_11_2016,homeless,"Yes. Sometimes I get a little bit confused what people are talking about. With paramedics mixed with homeless people and 911 calls and a social worker, sometimes I feel that it's assumed that homeless people are mentally ill and they need to be taken to a doctor.",portland
05_11_2016,homeless,"I'm just sick, okay? I'm not a homeless, mentally ill person, but I was so incapacitated. It was, the virus was going around [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_11_2016,homeless,"I'm making a point. Watch out what you're doing here, assuming that all people who look homeless or are throwing up or on the sidewalk could be sick. Good point.",portland
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"So we'll do an overview of the budget. [ORGANIZATION] covered some of the highest points on that. And then we'll walk through the actual, the budget itself, starting from the overall budget, different, both on the  Remind everybody where we are on the affordable housing set-aside, and then get into the specific urban renewal area budgets.",portland
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"So we have –  $300 million really left to spend on the set-aside. The different categories are we have three closed-out districts, districts that are no longer issuing debt payments,  When debt was issued there, there was money set aside for affordable housing. That money sits in our budget.",portland
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"So you see that's about $20 million. And then the remainder, about $284 million, is money that will flow into affordable housing from either existing resources or new debt in those districts. Okay.",portland
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"You can see how the amended set-aside policy played out. The percentages are very different across different urban renewal areas, with interstate having a significant, basically, the bulk of the dollars that remain in the interstate district will be going into affordable housing, so 70%. And FAC0 had a significant increase, as did [ORGANIZATION], and then the rest fall pretty close to that 30% number that we've used for [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"Well, they did do two other things, which would be unlikely that we'd ever do here. One is that as they master planned the area around FAC0, they created a favorable plan for development and mandated no affordable housing. So you've got just this –  huge area of high-end condos with no vision for affordable housing integrated in.",portland
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"So as you said, I'm here to testify on behalf of [ORGANIZATION], which is made up of a diverse group of stakeholders from the [ORGANIZATION] URAs. This is [ORGANIZATION] serving on the committee, and I just wanted to say that I was really pleased [ORGANIZATION] to see that the recommendations we made DATE2 were taken to heart by [ORGANIZATION]. And particularly as somebody who cares very much about affordable housing, I've been happy to see the increased coordination and cooperation between [ORGANIZATION] and ORG2.",portland
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"We're going to quickly run, we're going to finish up with FAC0 and then go through the neighborhood ones, and then we'll bring [ORGANIZATION] will come up and offer the neighborhood committee perspective. So FAC0, the bulk of our dollars DATE0 going into the parcel three affordable housing development, so that obviously came out of the conversation DATE1 around the set-aside. So we would, I think that's pretty much.",portland
05_11_2016,affordable housing,"Okay. So now I'll move to adopt [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON0, would you please read the description?",portland

05_02_2018,homeless,"And just knowing a lot of people in this room [ORGANIZATION], I know it's important to all of you as well. And it has become clear to many of us through the efforts we're engaged in, and I realize the proclamation is broad in its approach, but as I think about the services that the city delivers, both our first responders and our police bureau and our fire bureau, And I think about the work that we do around the homeless population on our streets and the many service providers that we interact with.",portland
05_02_2018,homeless,It will. So we're assuming that...  all homeless people have easy access to a telephone? So we have worked with outreach providers to assist and make sure that all the outreach providers working with the population are aware of the process.,portland

Decrease program expenses in [ORGANIZATION], this is general fund, by $1,250,000 for [ORGANIZATION] and set aside funds for program carryover and allocation in the [ORGANIZATION] budget.

This is for shelter capital costs. and they were not expended during [ORGANIZATION], so we were requesting that they be carried over to [LOCATION], and that has been done in discussion with [ORGANIZATION].",portland

And what [ORGANIZATION] can do with new financial products, where there's frankly a market gap,  Perhaps property tax abatement assistance is to help make creating them more available. And if you want to achieve affordable, like regulated affordable housing and accessory dwelling units, there are some tools we can look at, like a waiver of your limited property tax while you have someone low income living in the ADU.",portland
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"or if the city provides some financing, do a waiver on interest payments during the time that someone who's income-prolifying lives there at a low rent. So there are some tools we can explore, and we know, though, that from other cities that have linked  accessory dwelling units to regulated affordable housing, it's turned out to be a poison pill, intentioned or not. So I hope that [ORGANIZATION] does look for new ways that we can stimulate affordable housing and ADUs and look for some of the financing things that [ORGANIZATION] is working on with ORG1 to be a leader in that [STREET] as well.",portland
05_02_2018,housing crisis,"But, I mean, honestly, the [ORGANIZATION] will probably be nicer than the main house. Yeah.

05_02_2018,affordable housing,"It was $8 million of lost revenue in parks in [ORGANIZATION] from the affordable housing waiver and that system development charge waivers. That's a lot of money that could be used for developing new parks in [ORGANIZATION], where you'll all remember those three lovely master plans that we approved that we don't have the money to build. So the waivers benefit homeowners and potentially the few renters who are renting those individual apartments.",portland

I've come here [ORGANIZATION] to give testimony on the resolution to extend the waiver of the service development charges on ADUs on behalf of our past, current, and future clients as well as their communities, not on behalf of my company.

If it somehow changes on us in the midstream, then we need to be able to claw back that benefit. Hi.",portland
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"and I think our staff's got our wires crossed. First, I want to say I am in general support of the ORG0 development. The developer and all of the people involved are good actors in our affordable housing development community, and I was really excited by the potential that this lot offered.",portland
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"And, and the developer didn't necessarily need to have that commercial floor and could, could have limited it, but there was no [STREET] that we could guarantee that we can't actually say, here's your new zoning with some restrictions.

So just want to make sure that I covered all the bases.",portland
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"And as you heard me say [ORGANIZATION], we can't say we're for affordable housing but not in our neighborhood.

Is this a first cousin of what we did at [ORGANIZATION]?",portland
05_02_2018,affordable housing,"So we're giving the people who asked and not really considering those who didn't ask. I would say in this case, since we have an affirmative interest in getting churches to develop property with affordable housing that links the beloved community with the housing in a campus setting, I think for me this is distinguishable.

By contrast, we had a lot of community capacity around affordable housing, even a very significant understanding of land use, but this was an area when we compared ourselves to other cities that we saw we had room for growth.

One of the reasons we're seeing an increase in people with mental health issues and homelessness is that [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] is the de facto service provider for the region, and we really need our neighbors to be able to serve their own community members so people can stay in their communities where they have the best chance of recovering and getting back on their feet, and so that we can... begin to turn the tide on this really urgent matter.

In recognition of that impact, the resolution before you [ORGANIZATION] directs [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] to draft an ordinance requiring short-term rental platforms to collect an additional $2 per booking night to be dedicated to housing and homeless initiatives and to help mitigate the impact that short-term rentals have on the housing market generally. There are at least two other cities in the [ORGANIZATION] that have implemented similar per-night type fees.",portland
05_31_2017,housing crisis,"Third, the city is about to sit down and undertake negotiations with [ORGANIZATION] for the purposes of attempting to bring them into full compliance with our laws, including to collect arrears from taxes that they have not paid in the past. And finally, [ORGANIZATION], this measure, recognizing that there is an adverse impact on the housing crisis by taking these units offline, proposes that we add a $2 per night fee and that an ordinance come back to us for that purpose. In totality, the actions we've taken...  recognize that with changes in technology, people are increasingly going to be booking units using the Internet, their computer or their phone, and technology provides convenient ways of doing so.",portland
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"If you could speak to an estimated...  I don't know if we have even good intel about how many units are on the market for those services. Well, just we do know – and it's a great question, [ORGANIZATION]. We did get a report, I think, during [ORGANIZATION] of all the revenue that's reported from short-term rentals –  because by council ordinance that revenue goes into the housing investment fund and is used to build and preserve affordable housing.",portland
05_31_2017,affordable housing,So we did make a conscious decision to take the revenue stream for short-term rentals and use it to mitigate the impact on affordable housing. We have quantified the amount of the existing revenue. The challenge here is that there are so many units that are under the radar because the platforms have failed and refused to give us the names and addresses of their hosts.,portland

[ORGANIZATION] was the director of [ORGANIZATION] at the time that the site was acquired, and he was supported by [PERSON], our housing finance manager, and [ORGANIZATION], who is our project manager. The other thing that I think is important to mention is that ORG2 has effectively increased the density of the property through a density transfer of [PERSON]'s historic [LOCATION] property in the neighborhood.",portland
05_31_2017,homeless,"So we were able to achieve an additional 16 affordable units over and above what they originally proposed in the [ORGANIZATION] proposal that they proffered to [ORGANIZATION].  $11.4 million is a lot of money, but this also leverages additional resources. The total project cost is some $35.8 million, which includes financial support from [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, [PERSON], [PERSON] itself, which has contributed a portion of its developer's fee to the project,  and [ORGANIZATION] through ORG6, because there are some project-based rental assistance vouchers attached to this particular project.

05_31_2017,homeless,"But we do find that most families we house struggle significantly, not only with income, but also with some other challenges. So we find that in order to help them succeed and stay stable in their housing, we really need to bring wraparound services.

05_31_2017,homeless,"We provide resident services on site. We will have a full-time staff person dedicated to this building, not only to serve the homeless families, but all 93 of our households. Our basic resident service program includes orientations and basic needs assessments.",portland
05_31_2017,affordable housing,So I guess we should acknowledge [ORGANIZATION]. This is part of the allocation that they made to ensure that we could get deeply affordable housing. It is indeed.,portland
05_31_2017,homelessness,"And maybe this is obvious, but we're talking about a lot of units for very low-income people, and many of them families coming off the streets, so coming out of homelessness, which is great. And you've talked about the wraparound services on site. So do these qualify as permanent supportive housing units, or are they functionally the equivalent?",portland
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"We had someone [TIME], to Commissioner [PERSON]'s point, who was here who spoke during the public comment, and she said we should be distributing affordable housing in neighborhoods across the city. And we talked about what it is to be in a high-opportunity area. To have family-friendly housing, deeply affordable, in the [ORGANIZATION], I mean, is about as good as you can get.",portland
05_31_2017,homeless,The 40 homeless families will be referred through the GPE0 Homeless Family [PERSON]. So the county will refer those that get to access the project-based vouchers. Okay.,portland
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"Absolutely. Great, thank you. The [ORGANIZATION] fee, [ORGANIZATION] company, has been retained by [ORGANIZATION] so that in the future, vacancies in the entire permanent affordable housing,  of some 14,000 units DATE0, vacancies will be placed through that online service.",portland
05_31_2017,homelessness,"This is a fabulous partnership, and I think –  One of the reasons it is so successful is all these different organizations coming together. You have the project sponsor, [ORGANIZATION],  [PERSON] for it, as has been discussed, has provided the Section 8 vouchers. ORG2 is partnering with the Multnomah County [PERSON]lessness Services, so we've got the county throwing their wholehearted support and infrastructure and capacity behind this important effort.",portland
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"I think it was 35% of the housing that was put in this development would be affordable housing. And the reason that the city purchased and was able to purchase this particular lot, known as [ORGANIZATION], from [ORGANIZATION] was because, according to the agreement, they had not met that threshold of affordable housing. And so the city was able to purchase this lot at a discount and –  Fortunately, [ORGANIZATION] has stepped up to the plate and is going to provide us with another income-restricted or low-income affordable housing, whatever you want to call it.",portland
05_31_2017,homelessness,"It meets so many of the city's goals. It serves the poorest of the poor within our community and with a focus on people who have experienced homelessness and want to get back on their feet. It's in a high-opportunity area, which means we're investing in a [STREET] that low-income, moderate-income, wealthy households would like to live, and so it advances our goal of giving people meaningful choice.",portland
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"When we build beautiful train stations and public amenities, people usually don't come out and say you're wasting money on that. When we invest in beautiful parks, people usually come and celebrate the fact and not criticize us. I'd like to think that we have the same pride in investing public resources in long-term affordable housing, which is part of the asset base of a healthy community.",portland
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"I am, of course, very excited about this project and especially happy to hear that you have 100% visitability and 100% adaptability and the partnership with [ORGANIZATION] because as short as we are in affordable housing, we're perhaps even shorter on accessible housing. Thank you.  [ORGANIZATION]. Well, thanks to everybody involved.",portland
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"Appreciate it. Last item, I believe. Item 604, authorize $220,922,137 million of general obligation bonds for affordable housing projects.",portland
05_31_2017,affordable housing,"Aye. Thank you again, Mr. [PERSON], Commissioners, [ORGANIZATION], City Debt Manager. This emergency ordinance does authorize $220.9 million approximately of additional general obligation debt to fund affordable housing costs.",portland
05_31_2017,affordable housing,We are authorizing at some point in the future debt management to issue debt up to $220 million so that we can invest in affordable housing development. The bond measure actually has some very specific criteria around who we serve and at what income level. We've also established an oversight body whose task it will be to provide advice to [ORGANIZATION] on projects as they come up.,portland
03_09_2016,homeless,"So when I look at the front of the [ORGANIZATION], and here's a woman in children's shelter, and they don't have the money to expand and to protect these people, it really makes me wonder how the city can do these deals where they're giving away millions, and they can't come up with the money to protect people  the homeless, women and children. I'm a product of a broken family. We used to have to open up the oven and turn on the heat because the oil tank was empty.",portland
03_09_2016,homelessness,"216, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homelessness. PERSON1? Okay, then let's move on to the...",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,And we are at regular agenda item 226. All right. Allow city subsidized affordable housing projects to utilize a type 2X land use review procedure pursuant to [ORGANIZATION] 33.730.025 for the duration of the housing emergency.,portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Go ahead and read 227 too also. 227. Direct ORG0 to develop a legislative proposal to amend Title 33 as part of Regulatory Improvement Code Amendment Package, RICAP No. 8, to simplify regulations, remove regulatory obstacles, and expedite processes for land use reviews and permits for affordable housing projects, mass shelters, and short-term housing.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. Thanks, [ORGANIZATION]. This resolution and ordinance will further [ORGANIZATION] commitment to addressing our affordable housing emergency.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,It also represents one of the many collaborative outcomes between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to expand our city's stock of affordable housing. And I'd like to thank Mayor [PERSON] for his support of these efforts and his sponsorship of these items. And the resolution directs ORG2 to conduct a legislative process  to identify other opportunities to increase affordable housing through the land use process and the ordinance establishes a new type of review process for affordable housing projects only and here to explain more is our housing director [PERSON] and development services director [ORGANIZATION] is here always to keep us honest  keep us on tack,portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,so uh please take it away thank you very much commissioner [ORGANIZATION] mr mayor members of [ORGANIZATION] my name is [PERSON] and i'd like to at least uh remind you that on [ORGANIZATION] the [ORGANIZATION] had a study session on  what we termed at that time the high cost of affordable housing.,portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"And just to refresh your memory and for the record, we evaluated all the current data as it related to housing prices of affordable housing. And we were able to isolate the cost drivers of affordable housing. Some 77% of the costs were hard costs.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"That is land, building, and labor principally. 14% of the costs of affordable housing were  was in what we call soft costs. That's architecture and engineering fees, its interest, its taxes, legal expenses, and the like.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"So it's not to diminish sort of the value added, but to –  to put it in perspective, to recognize that we do have a housing emergency and that the changes recommended to you [ORGANIZATION] are, in effect, a [STREET] by which to beta test in a short term [LOCATION], process improvements that could result in more affordable housing more quickly. I can go into more detail, but I'd like [ORGANIZATION] to talk a little bit about the specifics. Thank you, [PERSON].",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"I'd have to have a deeper conversation. So in your presentation, you've been very clear that there's no dilution of design standards. And I want to pick up on that for a second because one of the noteworthy things about city-owned or city-invested affordable housing is  is that it is typically not what communities rail against.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"That is, when you hear from folks in [ORGANIZATION] about crappy housing that is not designed in a [STREET] that's sensitive or respectful of the community, it is often the private market housing that's been slapped up and that looks like if a good windstorm comes, it'll be knocked down. Some of the most durable long-term and beautiful housing is the housing that the city has partnered with a nonprofit developer to build, and I can give you a thousand examples. So can you ensure us – and by the [STREET], I think that when we're using public dollars to invest in affordable housing, we should approach that just like we're building a [INSTITUTION] or a transportation hub or anything else.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,You just need to say yes. I definitely want to affirm your statement that affordable housing is not inferior housing. We don't need to cut corners with respect to the durability of materials or amenities.,portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is focused on reviewing projects that are developing  for sure, meeting the development standards, the design guideline, we would be looking at affordable housing similar as we would in private development and making sure those requirements are being met. That's the passion and the professional approach from all staff working in the design and historic sections. So that's something we can commit to because that's what we do.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"So one of the – and I appreciate Commissioner [PERSON] pointing this out for me. So in the second item we're going to take up, we are directing –  planning sustainability to review some of these other cost drivers, kind of below the line cost drivers, and including in that is a consideration as to whether Commissioner [PERSON]'s green building policy will apply to affordable housing. I just want to make sure I understand that.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,i think it's a fair conversation to have and we'll be happy to have that with them yes why is it a fair conversation that doesn't it before the council says we want to undo a policy we that [ORGANIZATION] put into law and defended for [ORGANIZATION] why why are we asking someone to revisit it well i don't think we're i mean we're asking [ORGANIZATION] ORG1 and [ORGANIZATION] commission to to look at the mix of things that may inhibit the delivery of affordable housing,portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"And I think the green building policy, it's always been a source of debate in the affordable housing arena. And I think it's a fair debate to have. And I welcome [ORGANIZATION] taking a look at it.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"It's written very broadly to remove obstacles and find ways to expedite projects that deal with mass shelters, affordable housing, and short-term housing. I'll just say for the record, this is the first time I can remember on my watch on the council where we've said that  we're going to ask someone to evaluate whether we should backtrack on our sustainability goals as to one class of housing as a [STREET] of saving money. And that's not the standard that we apply in any other setting.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"I have a few other – yes, I believe –  One of the elephants in the room is that the commissioner in charge of housing is also in charge of development services, and under other circumstances I might be concerned about that. Having seen Commissioner [PERSON] and the [STREET] he manages his bureaus, I am not at all concerned that he's going to be directing his staff in development services to approve affordable housing projects just to get them done. He has a history of respecting the process, respecting the land use guidelines,  review and indeed respecting his staff in development services and so i personally am confident that he will continue to allow the staff who i have found to be absolutely excellent in the design review section as in the rest of development services to do their work without interference so i just wanted to state that on the record  and thank you all for the work that you do.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"As was pointed out, applicants, if they prefer their chances with the city council rather than the design commission, can start with the design commission and come to us. So it seems to me that this is an appropriate switch, at least pending hearing testimony, and also looking at it as a stopgap measure rather than something that we're enacting  as a permanent basis, there's then a burden on the process and on the staff to prove that, in fact, we haven't reduced the standards or diminished the design of affordable housing in the pilot project. So that's the [STREET] I'm looking at it.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"My biggest concern is about that this change would –  I was glad to see that it requires city subsidy of at least five units at 60% of median family income or less. I'm wondering what's to stop a developer from going through the 2X process with the city subsidy to then say, oh, never mind, I'm actually going to build luxury condos instead. And they've already got the approval for the design, and they then don't give us the affordable housing.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"And what would trigger that? When we saw a building permit that came in and we were alerted from [ORGANIZATION] that, oh, they are not going to do the affordable housing they said they were going to do. So you could have some kind of a flag within?",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"yes great thank you very much i'm also going to offer an amendment on that five units after we hear some testimony from one of our design commissioners my final uh point i just want to put on the record that the council in the context of the comprehensive plan has been discussing making affordable housing the public benefit in  in for bonuses, for example. And so I want to be very clear and maybe get some head nods from my fellow commissioners. We're not making decisions on the comprehensive plan.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"However, we have been having significant discussions about affordable housing as a public benefit, and I want to be clear that that's partly why this is coming towards us and that that is something for [ORGANIZATION] and others to consider, that that's the direction that council may be heading in the comprehensive plan. Head nodding provided. Thank you.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"This is more related to 227 than 226, but...  We've already, I think all of us, asked the bureaus that engage in permitting to prioritize affordable housing. What I've heard is that we've also asked them to prioritize other things like [ORGANIZATION] and the ORG1 project, etc., So, I think that we need to be sure that we're all telling our people in the permitting bureaus, here is what the priority ranking is and you will spend, we recognize you will spend less time on X when you're spending more time on Y.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"So how transparent can we be with the development community about saying you can expect your non-affordable housing projects to be pushed back by [ORGANIZATION] because of this? And one sub-question is... When we're prioritizing affordable housing, does that mean that projects that are non-affordable housing projects that are currently in the queue that have been told that you may expect that they will have the project completed within DATE1  Will the affordable housing projects jump the queue so that those projects in the queue will be pushed back?",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"I appreciate the question and concern. It's competing priorities, and so at some point it becomes philosophical versus realistic, because you can only – there's so much capacity, limited capacity. So what we've done as a solution is to add more staff.  and communicate the sort of priority reality that if you want to focus on [ORGANIZATION], you want to focus on affordable housing, you want to focus on something else, if you're trying to do it with the same number of staff, it just doesn't work.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"They all have a role to play in this processing. So we're mindful that when a decision is made to prioritize one project and another project is given a lesser priority, I'm not sure that the system really allows you to –  to then put an alert out to the next project in line to say that you'll be [ORGANIZATION] than you would have been normally, as long as it occurs within the same allotted time that this council is established as a benchmark. We might not be able to be that specific project by project, but I do think it would be useful if we tried to provide whatever information we can to the development community saying, you've heard that we're prioritizing affordable housing, you might have some concerns about what that will mean for non-affordable housing projects.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"tens of thousands of deficit units in affordable housing for people under 60% MFI. I think it was about 25,000 units short. I hope that number will get more and more discussion, not so much here, but as we move towards [ORGANIZATION], because those people really need to know that they need to activate and support proposals like this and even more aggressive proposals so that  the housing can, we can move forward with housing.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"and then certainly can discuss some specifics as to some of the issues that you've already raised. Thank you. Mayor [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION], thank you for the opportunity to comment on the ordinance to allow city subsidized affordable housing to be reviewed through a type 2x design historic review instead of a type 3 design historic review.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"The design commission fully supports the creation and expediting of abundant affordable housing in our city. We recently reviewed two housing projects where we offered additional guidance, additional times to meet, and additional support for these projects to the development team. We are committed to assisting the expedient construction of affordable housing projects.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"However, this proposed ordinance was only shared with us [ORGANIZATION], and we would have preferred more time to have a thorough conversation about how to reach our collective goals. Thank you. We believe additional work is needed to help the needs of affordable housing, such as fee breaks and a swifter and more predictable Type III process.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Ideally, the land use process remains equal across the board for all types of projects. Affordable housing projects deserve the same level of respect and scrutiny as their neighbors. Affordable housing will be long-lasting and should be designed and reviewed with that in mind.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Under the proposed ordinance, that project would have only needed to provide five affordable housing units in order to avoid a Type 3 review. We request that the [ORGANIZATION] revisit the minimum requirements and provide a more meaningful threshold. For instance, at least 25% of the proposed housing units of a primarily housing project must be city-subsidized affordable housing units.",portland
03_09_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,Thank you again for your creativity and leadership in finding ways in which to address [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing crisis. Please know that we are a resource to you and always willing to participate in work groups that provide guidance for legislation such as this ordinance. This is my favorite.,portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is committed to supporting high-quality, low-maintenance, affordable housing where the residents are proud of their home and the neighbors are proud to have the project in their neighborhood. There's also a letter submitted from [ORGANIZATION]. I don't know if they're here or not.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] is much attuned to and supportive of the need to retain existing affordable housing that is often the target of demolition, and we certainly support the development of additional affordable housing. There are many examples of historic buildings being successfully redeveloped into affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], including most recently FAC0 in LOC0, and we would love to see more of that.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"If we're concerned about the money and the city is investing money, it would seem like it would be a pragmatic approach to waive the additional fee that is required for these affordable housing projects. And when looking at affordable housing, and there was a comment brought up regarding 22-gauge exterior versus 18-gauge, affordable housing has an established history of significant deferred maintenance, and that is one of the reasons that you put a more durable surface on there so that you do not have that apparent degrading of the exterior in it. And that would seem like the city's investment would be very concerned about the longevity of that.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"And we're talking about time and money here, and so time is going to be longer. Money is something that can be reduced just by a simple statement that it's no longer going to be required for affordable housing. And then also within the history element, the recreation needs of goal number eight would have to be ignored.",portland

03_09_2016,affordable housing,"Now, the importance of  of public input, although Commissioner [PERSON] obviously is correct in terms of the opportunity, the opportunity for public input in the Type 2X process is much, much, much less than the opportunity is in the Type 3. The relative costs, in addition to the time of the design view, are minuscule if  If affordable housing units cost about $500,000 apiece or $300,000 apiece, then, well, that's what they were when I was working at the state commissioner. Let's say 230, okay?",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"It's a philosophical conceptual understanding. So we're removing the standards, and the [STREET] to do this is just to take the funds that would otherwise be used to supplement –  the affordable housing and make sure that part of those funds are used to cover the development costs, which include review. Let's see.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"The notion of maintaining the quality of housing, whether it be affordable housing or whether it be market rate, and really the difference is with with methods of funding. Whether we're talking about either of those, then we're really talking about the the notion of the all-important notion of nimbyism, not in my backyard, the reluctance of  of citizens to have substandard housing in their neighborhood and the clarity with which folks who live in substandard housing, by substandard, I mean very clearly, not designed as well or not designed as compatibly with the neighborhood to increase and maintain livability. It will be so obvious to everyone that the residents, they have not the means to live someplace better.",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,I'm a very strong advocate of both the retention and creation of affordable housing. I'm a [ORGANIZATION] resident and I'm doing what I can to preserve the exceptionally dense number of affordable housing buildings in that neighborhood against potential demolition threats posed by the excessive height allowances proposed by [LOCATION] plan.,portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"But the public process is a foundation of good government, and the effective loss of this part of the process creates a reduction in transparency and a danger of decisions done in the proverbial smoke-filled back rooms. With this change will also be the loss of an opportunity to publicly tell the stories attached to these buildings as they are readapted for an admittedly terribly important use as affordable housing. We are a forgetful species and need reminding how else but through the public process do we learn about the nearly lost story of the first maternal hospital in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_09_2016,affordable housing,"So we can provide both direct and indirect assistance to affordable housing developers  principally private developers, and this could receive favorable design treatment in the future if they have at least 20 units within them. So that applies. Thank you.",portland

03_23_2016,homeless,"I think we're very pleased to be able to provide a high number of units in the project that are at and below 30 percent of our immediate income.

We've –  we started to kick around an idea i just want to flag for you and then at some point we'll follow up with you you're going to you're going to develop this project and at some point the residents may come to you and say we'd like to have some vending machines in the building and it's not not atypical and that's why we often find vending machines that have sodas and snacks at shelters and affordable housing developments And I've always wondered when we do that why we put some of the least healthy food in facilities with some of the most vulnerable people.",portland

03_23_2016,homeless; affordable housing,yeah i wanted to state too that i'm not um against the affordable housing obviously i believe that you know the city needs a lot more affordable housing but i also think that you guys could actually do it a lot cheaper by creating tiny homes and building them and putting people in those you know and  I don't think that [ORGANIZATION] is a good organization because they seem to war on the homeless a lot.,portland

04_29_2015,homelessness,"And I just wanted to come here [TIME] to thank you, Mr. [PERSON] and Commissioner [PERSON], and the [ORGANIZATION] for its continued support and leadership on behalf of the city's most vulnerable. And in particular, I'm speaking to your support for shelter off the [STREET] options for women who are experiencing homelessness and also for support to housing options for veterans and for their families. With regards to women's sheltering, by transitioning what has been a women's [ORGANIZATION] shelter to a [LOCATION] women's emergency shelter, the city will be helping to provide continued assistance and, frankly, safety for up to 700 women.",portland
04_29_2015,homelessness,"but it requires additional funding at the city level to leverage those dollars most effectively and help us [STREET] towards our common goal, which, of course, is to end veteran homelessness, functionally speaking, by [ORGANIZATION]. That's going to be a tough effort. We believe it's attainable, but it will be all hands on deck, and we're very grateful to count all of your hands on that deck as well.",portland
04_29_2015,homeless; homelessness,"Sure. So I'm [PERSON] and I'm the manager of [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION]. And I'm here mostly just to say thank you to [ORGANIZATION] for all the support that we felt through the 25 City Initiative, the Mayor's Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness.",portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"Also, I'll be quick. I wasn't able to be at your budget hearing on [ORGANIZATION] because I was at [ORGANIZATION].  which is also of great concern to many of us. And I just want to support the others.",portland
04_29_2015,homelessness,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION]. And I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to thank you, the [ORGANIZATION] as a whole, for the support on the money for ending veterans' homelessness.",portland
04_29_2015,homelessness; affordable housing,"I also want to ask for your continued leadership as we seek to recruit additional landlords in the private rental market. It is taking the joint team about two to three times as long to secure units. And as we move through [ORGANIZATION] and seek to increase the availability of landlords for affordable housing, we're asking for your leadership in that to bring people to the table to support financial resources needed to maintain those relationships and to align the city's affordable housing development with ending homelessness goals.",portland
04_29_2015,houseless,Is this going to be out-of-state labor? I have a suggestion. There's a lot of houseless folks that could use some work right now because nobody is hiring houseless folks as far as I know.,portland
04_29_2015,houseless,I don't think it's going to be as difficult or as problematic as some people might think or try to impose. I think this could be very cooperative with the city and the houseless. And I would recommend that you look into it and take a hard look at trying to get some of the houseless folks involved.  to work.,portland
04_29_2015,homelessness,"First of all, I want to echo and agree with just about everybody who spoke here [ORGANIZATION] on the various different issues. I haven't heard anything that I disagree with. So in terms of how do we develop our neighborhoods, how do we deal with the issues of veterans' homelessness, homelessness in general, all of the different subjects.",portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"So it's rich in data, but it's also sobering in its message. Thank you. and I hope that we will all, as a result of this report, rededicate ourselves to increasing the supply of affordable housing and continuing to help those who are most vulnerable to changes in our economic climate.",portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"As I said, this report is rich in other data and on [ORGANIZATION], its affordable housing portfolio, expenditures related to affordable housing, and we will be seeking ORG2 and community feedback on this report,  to help make sure that it becomes, as I said, it will become a regular occurrence in [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION] that we will present this report. So we're presenting it to you now in [DATE], but we will be doing a supplement to this and getting it on a regular [ORGANIZATION] cycle. And it will also become more or less the vehicle for which many of the reports that  uh [PERSON] is required by one ORG2 ordinance or another to submit to ORG2 we will try to get those all incorporated into one comprehensive report that you such as you have before us now",portland
04_29_2015,homelessness,"Part four, as [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, presents information on the historic reporting, the programming and direct expenditure of [ORGANIZATION] on homelessness and housing programming, and then part five comments on the methodology. Thank you. So at a citywide and a neighborhood level, the first section of analysis is really looking at the demographic data.",portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,It shows that we are meeting the adopted policy goal of an aggregate citywide minimum of 30% of tax increment financing dedicated to affordable housing. We talk a bit about that on page 85 of your report. Thank you.,portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"So what we learn is that investing in housing affordability works. DATE0, the number of regulated affordable housing units in [ORGANIZATION] ballooned from 12,800 in [LOCATION] to nearly 20,000 DATE2. And of those regulated units, 65% were funded, at least in part, by [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION].",portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you. So preserving the city's investment in our affordable housing infrastructure is a cost-effective and vital intervention. The city currently regulates through [ORGANIZATION] over 12,000 units that we have invested in to keep their rents affordable for our citizens.",portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"The [ORGANIZATION] currently prioritizes our preservation work, but, I mean, of course, that stock is aging. And so in upcoming reports, the [ORGANIZATION] is going to share more details with ORG1 about your affordable housing infrastructure. So the [STREET], a couple more pieces of information, the [STREET] that the city's investment in the preservation and creation of affordable housing is funded is two primary ways.",portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"This is all from [ORGANIZATION] for a variety of kinds of affordable housing investments. [ORGANIZATION] has dropped quite a bit over time, although it's stabilizing. Our next most robust form of subsidy, [ORGANIZATION], has also been dropping and right now has a little less favor in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
04_29_2015,homeless,"So we're not as optimistic about that. And then a couple more specialized sources, housing opportunities for people with AIDS,  and the Emergency Solutions Grant, which is directed specifically for homeless interventions. You three probably know more about the prospects that we have in [ORGANIZATION] than I do, so we'll leave it at that.",portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"For funds available for the development of affordable housing as currently projected both by [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, so it includes recent decisions by council As you see various districts tail off that's generally just the end of the district Although a lot of times we have you know downtown waterfront ended [ORGANIZATION] and  We had a recent loan come back in, so we've actually got a little pot of money there. Even though that district is closed, we can continue to spend the proceeds specifically for affordable housing in that urban renewal area.",portland
04_29_2015,homelessness,"I think that just makes sense to most people. Two other minor things. In page 96 on the homelessness expenditures, just a quick primer, what is the difference between direct and indirect expenditures?",portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"And because this is such a valuable education tool, I would urge you to consider a definitions page early on. Yeah, that's a good idea. To just in plain English tell your story so that people then, as they read it, know what we mean by affordable housing or...  tax increment of finance or whatever, regulated unit, just the basic information.",portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"Because I think this is going to have an amazing, a tremendous impact on raising public awareness and understanding. And then finally, I hesitate to open up this scab, but there's another equity piece that we don't really get to here, which is the region. We're half the population of the region and two-thirds of the affordable housing, and that's not sustainable yet.",portland
04_29_2015,homeless,"And his house was foreclosed on in [ORGANIZATION], and my mom and I were made homeless. I had gone to [ORGANIZATION] to study a master's and moved back in [LOCATION], which is when I kind of came onto your radar, as we were looking for houses. So housing and jobs  you know the the kind of idea that an education will help you to pull yourself up and to stabilize your family are very um out of reach i appreciate this report as i've said before i also very much appreciate the work of [ORGANIZATION] in leading this data it's very important",portland
04_29_2015,homelessness,"You're still implementing other plans. They're working. We need to have 1,000-plus people on the streets that will rotate and not end up becoming chronic homelessness.",portland
04_29_2015,homeless,"So, [ORGANIZATION], you will be greatly missed, and thank you for your service. commissioner [PERSON] as your as the housing commissioner you've made transparency and accountability a hallmark and you have been focused on making sure we have good data and that helps us make wiser decisions so thank you for your passion for this this exercise and this report which i think is going to be very helpful to us as we make decisions going forward and then finally  What this report tells us is that if you are formerly homeless, working class, lower middle class, you can't afford to live in the city, and that's not the city that we want. And that has cascading effects, including eroding the base of our public schools, creating divisions, and ultimately, as PERSON2 often says, leading us down the path to some cities that we don't want to emulate, cities of just rich and poor.",portland
04_29_2015,affordable housing,"And it's not [ORGANIZATION] you find a bureau where sort of everybody –  is pulling in the same direction. And it helps that it's a small bureau, but it's also highly motivated and highly qualified people working there. This report provides a pretty clear picture of the need to increase the affordable housing stock throughout the city and also recognizes that our main source of affordable housing funding right now, urban renewal or tax increment funding, is nearing the end of its useful life.",portland
05_09_2018,homeless,"I no longer feel safe in our city and I am no longer proud to be a Portlander because of the condition of our downtown streets and sidewalks. DATE0, I was assaulted on my [STREET] to work at [ORGANIZATION] Clay [STREET]. Out of nowhere and unprovoked, a homeless man approached my car, reached in through my window, and grabbed me by my hair.",portland

05_09_2018,affordable housing,"That includes everything from [ORGANIZATION], that has become a really key anchor, for the community to FAC0, which is an affordable housing project, within the community to FAC1, which is a historic commercial building. Thank you.  very close by to ORG1 offices at [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. Clearly, there's also a pipeline for ongoing opportunity and additional placement of the remaining tax increment resources that we committed, and that ranges from [PERSON] to we own the old fire station over on FAC5, and we also own [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"And then the last goal is our district livability goal, which really focused on kind of the cultural, the historic and kind of the community development aspects  of [ORGANIZATION]. We're happy to state that we've placed about $800,000 worth of community livability grants in the district, and that has supported anything from [ORGANIZATION] that helps affordable housing residents seek a path to self-sufficiency through employment, all the [STREET] to supporting ORG1 redevelopment of property that they're purchasing. Thank you.  at FAC1, that they're actually looking to put into a permanent gallery space that celebrates [ORGANIZATION]'s Chinatown, its past, its presence, and its future.",portland
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"And the city, as I recall, bought an extra floor to make sure there was some affordable housing on that site. So now to have an opportunity to build out the rest of the site is very exciting. So I'm very pleased to support this.",portland
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is the executive director of [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION], a [ORGANIZATION] nonprofit that manages a portfolio of over 700 units of affordable housing and focuses on helping low-income families achieve stability and self-sufficiency.

05_09_2018,affordable housing,"In the next slide, you'll see a deeper look at affordable housing set-aside expenditures, which I'll remind the public while the affordable housing resources, the [ORGANIZATION] portion of it shows up on our books. [ORGANIZATION] does direct, along with [ORGANIZATION], those investments and the stewardship of those resources. But a deeper look at affordable housing set-aside expenditures show that [ORGANIZATION] is projected to invest more  $158 million of new [ORGANIZATION] resources in active urban renewal areas [ORGANIZATION], with an additional $135 million in programmed resources through the life of the urban renewal areas.",portland
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"The timing of the projects is what is impacting that number. In total, there's about $540 million that's projected to be spent [ORGANIZATION] and the life of the districts. As you well know to date, this has created 4,543 units of new or preserved affordable housing, and currently there are another 1,300 units in production.",portland
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"Along FAC0, our investments have been primarily in small businesses, also as [ORGANIZATION] looks at improvements along the FAC0 couplet. We are also working actively with ORG1 on a property at FAC1 and FAC2 that's right next to the new park that is just completing construction. It will be an affordable housing together with market rate housing and commercial.",portland
05_09_2018,affordable housing,development that's a partnership with both affordable housing and market rate developers. And then the second area that we're seeing a lot of interest amongst the community as well as the development community is at FAC0. There are joint property owners between the private sector and [ORGANIZATION] who's very interested in redevelopment of a 10-acre site out there.,portland
05_09_2018,homelessness,"We have to move forward. The question is how do we do it and how do we minimize the fiscal impact on people who own and people who lease the properties that we're discussing. I've made no secret that some of my priorities as mayor include housing and homelessness, and I want to do everything in my power to ensure that whatever policy comes forward is intentional and well thought out and does the best that it can to preserve housing and avoid displacement and maintain affordability.",portland
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"More than 85% are commercial buildings, offices, warehouses, retail. And there are also about 7,200 residential units in [LOCATION]. About 1,800 of these are publicly financed affordable housing.",portland
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"So we designed a process that started with a technical committee that was charged with providing recommendations on retrofit standards, then a support committee to develop financial options, and finally a policy committee that was intended as a sort of conference committee that would knit together the recommendations of both groups into a coherent program to address this issue. The policy committee included members of both the financial and technical committees, as well as stakeholders representing schools, churches, affordable housing, and historic preservation interests. The committee was intended to meet for [ORGANIZATION], but ended up meeting for [LOCATION].",portland
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"And again, a reason we owe a special debt of gratitude to these volunteers, who worked on a consensus basis to make their recommendations. They organized their own subcommittees on affordable housing and not-for-profits and historic buildings, and they hosted open house events for both tenants and building owners, and they invited and received a great deal of public testimony at every meeting. Their work also generated significant media interest, and staff took the committee's work on the [STREET], presenting at more than 20 different community venues.",portland
05_09_2018,affordable housing,"The other was that the committee really struggled with this balance of public safety and financial impact. And we spent a lot of time on it. And I think we got to a pretty good consensus about  We did spend some time in that period also talking about affordable housing, the city's commitment to affordable housing and the fact that it houses many of our most vulnerable residents.",portland
05_09_2018,affordable housing,We talked about extending time for retrofits for affordable housing and concluded not to do that. But two members of the committee...  [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON1 from ORG1 did commit to the committee that ORG2 could look at what the requirements would be to address that housing stock and what would happen over time with the resources reasonably available. So I'm hopeful they'll come forward with that.,portland

05_09_2018,affordable housing,"My greatest concern are the unintended consequences of a mandatory program for both the city and the property owner. From the city's standpoint, the unintended consequences range from proposed mandatory provisions conflicting with other city policies, such as affordable housing and workspaces, and policies that...  are meant to preserve and strengthen the cultural and economic vitality of existing neighborhoods. It is quite likely that a mandatory program could lead to a significant number of buildings being transferred to the hands of developers, possibly leading to increased demolition and decreased ownership of local buildings.",portland

Essentially, it's the same as what's going to result from any of these map changes, which will require affordability now whenever there's development on maps. these faith-owned properties.",portland
05_27_2020,affordable housing,Is that what you mean? I guess I'm hearing something different [ORGANIZATION] than I heard before. I thought that the whole reason why we were bringing this whole proposal forward was the desire for some institutions to be able to build affordable housing.,portland
02_26_2020,homeless,"Same to my colleagues, thank you for your patience. First up is communications, [ORGANIZATION]. Item 158, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding the homeless camping, drug sales, and use prostitution.",portland
02_26_2020,houseless,"Being houseless, however, is not a crime. It is a situation. And so I just wanted to correct that misperception that somehow we're not allowing police officers to police the city of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_26_2020,homelessness,"Item 159, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homelessness and its effect on the neighborhood. Is [PERSON] here? Next, please.",portland
02_26_2020,homeless,"Item 160, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding housing first and propose a viable alternative solution to the homeless crisis called elevator economics theory. Too bad. I was too.",portland
02_26_2020,homeless,"As of right now, there is a population of constituents and residents that are unable to file for protection orders because they do not meet the criteria. These criteria center around domestic partnership and committed partnership. This population includes the homeless who are living on the streets being subjected to abuse.",portland
02_26_2020,houseless,"Thank you. And I believe that 162, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] regarding houseless pod village on FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_26_2020,homeless,"DATE0, I am here to speak to you about a concern I have and a group of residents that includes renters, landlords, business owners, and property owners about the possibility of the village pods for homeless people on FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION]. The group I joined is called [ORGANIZATION]. We meet DATE1 as an open forum.",portland
02_26_2020,houseless,"So much for the kindness of the heart for our houseless people. There were several community meetings, both at the church and [ORGANIZATION]. These meetings became unruly and contentious at best.",portland
02_26_2020,homeless,"And so my question to you is, why do you believe the city has a role in that? Well, because your homeless group headed up by [ORGANIZATION] has been at the forefront to some of the so-called community meetings supporting the idea of putting this village pod together. on FAC0.",portland
02_26_2020,homeless,So that means it's probably not going to be $8 million a year. It's probably going to be more like $5 million a year if you're trying to entice people to move over to this natural gas. So how much over the time and what could be done with that money to like benefit the homeless who have a lack of bathrooms?,portland
02_26_2020,homeless,"I think of the chain link fencing around FAC0 where there's 36 bathrooms in there on the men and women's side and there's chain link fencing and there's all those homeless people in tents out there. So and I also wanted to talk about you know [[ORGANIZATION]ERSON] used to send their scrubbed waste to [[ORGANIZATION]ERSON] to put on their [ORGANIZATION] wheat. I mean why can't we have you know in these outlying areas where people are you know more into using composting toilets, why can't we send the [ORGANIZATION] to the alfalfa fields, which is what they say it could be used for.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,And I wanted to reiterate what [ORGANIZATION] we are asking [ORGANIZATION] to do. There are two things that we're asking [ORGANIZATION] to do. One is to exempt affordable housing units from the multimodal incentive within the commercial mixed-use zones.,portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"What I wanted to reiterate is that what we're not asking [ORGANIZATION] to do [ORGANIZATION] is to.  amend the zoning code or to take new action on policy aside from the waiver of affordable housing. [PERSON] already took that action in [LOCATION] as part of the update to the comprehensive plan and the transportation system plan. [PERSON] unanimously approved  changes to require transportation demand management actions in the commercial mixed-use zone for developments that are of 10 units or more that are within what we define as frequent service to transit, which is a [TIME] line.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"However, as staff worked through and worked with other bureaus on implementation, concerns were raised around the impact of affordable housing. So therefore, we're proposing a separate rate for the multimodal incentive fee for affordable units in the transportation fee schedule, and then to exempt those units from the multimodal incentive fee for [ORGANIZATION] through [LOCATION]. So again, just to sum up why we're here DATE2 and bringing this one piece of the implementation package to you, the current transportation fee schedule does not include the multimodal incentive fee component.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"So we need to amend that schedule to include the multimodal incentive fees for market rate and affordable units. And then the second component is providing this exemption for affordable units only.  to the multimodal incentive fee element for [ORGANIZATION] through [LOCATION]. And then finally, we are bringing this as an emergency DATE2 because we need this exemption for affordable housing and these lines in the transportation fee schedule to be in [STREET] as the comprehensive plan is enacted [TIME].",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"But I put these forward as amendments that I hope you will see as strengthening the commitment around affordable housing. But I'll let the chips fall where the chips might. So the first amendment I'd like to propose would be a Section D under the Section 2.  D, there is a 2C currently.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"We want to make sure that we balance the production of the affordable housing without cost burdening our partners or  with ensuring that tenants of affordable units receive the same transportation benefits as tenants of market rate units. In other words, this is a study. It's geared towards...",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"I would say, of course, the [ORGANIZATION] is concerned about the cost of affordable housing, as you are, would reflect that. In some ways, the dollar will go further with residents of affordable units because they are, in general, less likely to own automobiles. They will often also be eligible for ORG1 low fare programs.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"And number four, other technical and policy related map changes as appropriate. For example, changes to facilitate affordable housing and address city bureau coordination, overlay zone corrections, recently identified nonconforming commercial uses, and additional split zones. You held a public hearing on this project on [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"So in other words, we have double the capacity in this new map that [ORGANIZATION] assigns to us. Who this housing benefits, through what means and ends, is the crucial part of this conversation, which we will continue in the context of the residential infill project and on various different development projects. It's essential that we focus our efforts on affordable housing options and commercial options that serve all Portlanders, particularly those who are low income and at risk of displacement or further displacement.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"The affordable housing bonus is required to be used if the bonus height is used. It also increases the base floor area ratio to 9 to 1 on the full block if all floors above the ground floor on the western one half of the block are in a residential use. This amendment also increases the base height...  on the four northern blocks of the new Chinatown-Japantown historic district to 200 feet, which is still a reduction to height on these blocks that exist [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"And I'm offering these amendments because I do believe, as whenever I offered it before, that the couple things, one is that what sways me to go from 160 to 200 feet is the extra affordable housing that we will get on Block 33. And finally, I just believe we need to infuse [ORGANIZATION] with activity, and there is none there now. We need people that live there as well as work there.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"Now, knowing that three of the [ORGANIZATION] have decided to approve this, I looked into can we do something in the zoning code to protect [ORGANIZATION], and I believe the answer is no. When we're talking about affordable housing, we're going to get affordable housing if there is residential development anyway. And what [PERSON] has been on record is saying that they don't need more affordable housing.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"We are now near the end of the development cycle. That is broadly accepted. I believe with 200 feet, based on what I understand to be the process, and I'm going to ask a few follow-up questions in a moment, there is not a substantial difference in terms of impact there,  yet there is potentially a significant difference in terms of affordable housing opportunities, as well as housing generally in this area where currently people could build higher to the north and there is nothing built on FAC0.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"And businesses are struggling, and they can certainly use more housing. Secondly, I would think that anyone who's remotely familiar with my position on housing would never think that  that the argument that we don't need affordable housing would fly with me. I frankly find that offensive.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"Market rate housing is affordable to people earning 120% or more of median income. And when we're talking about affordable housing in regards to inclusionary zoning, we're talking about housing that's affordable to people at 60 and 80 percent of MFI, median family income. And those are many people who do vital work in our city and are not somehow less desirable neighbors than those that can afford market-rate rents.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"We count among our clients individuals, local and national developers, affordable housing agencies, as well as local, state, and federal governments. I FOUNDED HERITAGE IN DATE0. FOR [ORGANIZATION] TOWN.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"While I am very pleased and grateful that this council has made clear that whatever our decision, any future height increases will be linked to a bonus for affordable housing, and I think that was very important. And frankly, I compliment staff for having crafted that mechanism because we essentially imported something that didn't really apply to a historic district from outside the district. And so regardless of the outcome of this vote,  We have ensured that there will be some affordable housing.",portland
05_24_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] would be a tremendous amenity for our growing neighborhood. While FAC0 has long been a major business district, [ORGANIZATION] have seen us transforming into one of the city's most accessible places to live. We currently have hundreds of residential units under construction, including [ORGANIZATION] 12-story affordable housing development and many more developments in the planning stage.",portland

04_18_2018,homelessness,"[TIME], moving back to what I was just talking about, there was a lot of people came with signs that said, care, not cops. and I would suggest that that's a false dichotomy, that we don't have to choose one or the other, that we can find funding for the things that are important and that we need to provide funding for positive things at the same time that we're addressing some of the most crucial issues in our community, like homelessness, unaffordable rents, and community policing. So thank you all for being here.",portland
04_18_2018,affordable housing,"Each ORG1-application, as you know, has to come before [ORGANIZATION] for approval. In addition to the [ORGANIZATION] tax exemption provided by the ORG1, this project will also receive an exemption of the affordable housing construction excise tax that otherwise would have been due on the affordable units. This project will join the other 19 private sector projects in the inclusionary housing permit approval pipeline, making a minimum of 92 units affordable in otherwise market rate developments.",portland
04_18_2018,affordable housing,"Well, again, thanks to Commissioner [PERSON] for his work getting this inclusionary housing allowed at the legislature. This one works out to be $567 that the taxpayers will be foregoing in order to have each affordable housing unit, which is obviously a very inexpensive [STREET] of providing some support for people needing housing at 80% of their average median income.

03_18_2015,homeless; houseless,Okay. Let's try the next one. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homeless houseless issues.,portland
03_18_2015,houseless,Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding houseless issues. I'm seeing [PERSON] here. Is [PERSON] here?,portland
03_18_2015,homeless,"Mayor [PERSON], could I speak about the homeless? Not now. You've got to stay on the agenda.",portland
03_18_2015,homeless,"You need to look at the ability of the president of the council and the mayor to –  improve, to be less exclusive, and also to improve the situation we have in [TIME] with public comment so that people who have been in the audience at 9.30 might be able to make more spontaneous remarks to some of the serious issues that are facing the city. But as to this particular agreement, or not agreement, but change into our city's structuring of how we...  It's hard to say how we protect the image of a city that has homeless people sleeping underneath the sign. So I think we'll have to also talk about where that revenue goes, that it doesn't just cover administrative costs.",portland
05_03_2017,affordable housing,"We did look at it as to could it be used for affordable housing, could it be used for the navigation centre. Neither PERSON0 or the director of [ORGANIZATION] was interested in that. And we just can't, we don't have the $10 million.",portland
05_03_2017,houseless,"What is sanctuary really? I will go now back to...  deep into the roots of my family while you decide if you will fire the Nazi cops on our police force or continue to hand out the free pass of oppression and terror over us, the Jews, the blacks, the houseless, the poor, the oppressed under your current rule. So $4 million to parking lots, to security for parking lots, a private parking lot firm as far as I know.",portland
05_03_2017,houseless,"I believe that $4 million sounds a bit excessive. In the past, like [ORGANIZATION] said, [PERSON] died in a parking garage in downtown [ORGANIZATION] and I would hope that if you're  trying to spend more on security, that you would be able to use that security to make sure that some of our houseless members who are seeking refuge or warm places in these parking garages  aren't used to brutalize them and to exclude them from these public spaces because I don't find it acceptable that people are dying on our streets and you're wanting to spend $4 million more over DATE0 DATE1 on added security measures. It just doesn't sound plausible or humane is actually the better word for it.",portland
05_03_2017,houseless,"I'd like to see, since it's city-owned and since we're talking about the allocation of city funds, I want to see a full budget justification for this request. I want to know why $4 million is the number. And not only that, exactly where would you like houseless people to go?",portland
05_03_2017,houseless,"And [ORGANIZATION] that I come here, I hear millions for this and millions for that and this and that. And I don't hear anybody talking about allocating funds to uplift black communities or allocating funds to take care of people that are houseless. The hell is wrong with you people?",portland
05_03_2017,houseless,more money for the freaking cops. Who do you think you're kidding? So you can target houseless people and people of color.,portland
05_03_2017,homeless,"You should sell all these parking structures off. Take the money back, as some people said. Put it into the...  building more housing for the homeless, and or you must reserve the right to redevelop these pieces of well-located properties and also build apartments up above.",portland
05_03_2017,houseless,"And what isn't being addressed is our houseless community in [ORGANIZATION]. I mean, I know people get tired of me coming here and talking about the houseless community, but they're everywhere. And we have to care about it, not sweep them up, not put paving pothole roads in front of living people and their animals in our houseless communities in our park, in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_03_2017,houseless,"There's people who live in [ORGANIZATION] and should have homes. And instead of having homes, we've created one, two, I don't know, five, seven, maybe ten different new apartment structures for people who have money, who have never lived in [LOCATION], who are now all in [LOCATION], in [ORGANIZATION], really not...  being a part of our community at all, wishing that people in the houseless community would just go away when we tried to bring in housing for them. I mean, this thing, it comes back to gentrification.",portland
05_03_2017,houseless,"You pick it, where you live. We have to take care of the houseless. And I would like to see attention from my community in [ORGANIZATION] instead of just my, my, my, my, my for our poor [STREET].  which we can't walk down, what about coming here and talking about our houses community and dealing with homes there?",portland
05_03_2017,houseless,"I mean, I haven't forgotten the snowstorm and the absolute ultimate failure of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. And their inability to...  preemptive strike or even follow through with anything comprehensive that will lead to the city being able to function on a healthier level. But this sounds more to me like a bunch of white people in [ORGANIZATION] are upset that houseless people and people of color and other vulnerable community members are there.",portland
05_03_2017,houseless,"People that you conveniently leave out of these conversations, even though they do a lot more community work than you do. This is just to sweep out houseless people. Because a bunch of white people don't like how their sidewalk looks.",portland
05_03_2017,affordable housing,"In partnership with our local tech community, we aspire to collect and release data that will decrease congestion, increase transit ridership, and active transportation opportunities. This open data program will not just benefit our transportation plans, but a host of city services from affordable housing placement to enhancing our emergency medical response system. So I want to thank all the bureaus involved in the effort, as well as you, Mayor, for your leadership in bringing this forward [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_03_2017,homeless,"It's using predictive analytics. And that's where in [ORGANIZATION], officials there turned a terrible fire tragedy in that city into a better service for all citizens by creating a model that helps firefighters identify which homes are most at risk of having a non-functioning smoke detector and contacting the homes in those areas to offer a free installation. It's using performance-based contracting, where in [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], that city is using this approach to more actively manage their homeless services contracts.",portland
05_03_2017,homeless; homelessness,"And I think that what citizens and what government would want to see is  something that's visual, something that's easy to use, something that has an applied type of insight toward big issues that people are thinking about and has that opportunity to build what we think of as integration or these synapses of points of connections between bureaus and departments  For example, we worked with [ORGANIZATION] to take their state of housing report and make it something that you can understand visually, interact with, it's empathetic, but that we also added new data to that. And we were looking at pulling historic...  voter registration to see where people had been living and where people had actually been moving so we can understand a little bit more about what's happening in the city. We worked also with [ORGANIZATION], and perhaps we weren't able to bring a lot of new data there, but we were able to take the data they did have that was in a form that was difficult to understand, full of things that you can't share with the public because of privacy concerns, and take the story for everybody who has been working remotely  with homelessness and make that something that the public can engage with a little bit more.",portland
05_03_2017,homelessness,It turned out that the audience award at [DATE] was for the presentation that related to [ORGANIZATION]. And there was some astonishing data that they came up with on [ORGANIZATION]. But I was also really taken by some of the findings and some of the reporting around homelessness.,portland
05_03_2017,homeless,"And I think someone was, like,  One of the cops were putting tear gas everywhere, and I saw them running after homeless people and stuff and trying to hurt them. How did you feel? I felt scared, and I don't like the cops.",portland
05_03_2017,homelessness,"And so you can imagine what a kick I got out of it because I'm always crying about bunk beds. And my large-scale bunk housing, my argument goes deeper than that. Beyond homelessness and gentrification, it's about the concept of shared space as it decreases with development.",portland
05_03_2017,affordable housing,"We saw DATE0 in the items we discussed so far how you can have the information that's clearly written on the time certain and on the consent agenda about this is what this is and this is what we're doing. We're soliciting for our bids or we are building a bid.  low-cost affordable housing, and still people have questions, concerns, and they're going to need real people to be able to answer the phone, answer to the email, and explain things. Because a lot of what we do is very complicated.",portland
05_03_2017,affordable housing,"for all of the incredible and important work that they do in this community. I'm very much looking forward to the opening of their cultural center in [ORGANIZATION], where they've partnered with [ORGANIZATION] to also bring more affordable housing to the community. I know my staff is working diligently with both [PERSON] and ORG2 to fill the remaining gaps to make this project happen.",portland
05_03_2017,homeless,"So this is of utmost importance to me because we live in a rape culture here in [ORGANIZATION] where sexual assault is almost glorified on a [DATE] basis. And the objectification of marginalized community members, specifically women, women of color, youth, homeless people,  So I agree with [ORGANIZATION] that this database, it needs to be broadened. There needs to be more accountability.",portland
05_03_2017,homeless,"I've had personal friends have been raped. I had a report confidentially told to me from [ORGANIZATION] clear out by the city.  that every individual there, woman, has been raped not just once but twice. And I'm just curious how the police bureau is really accounted for on how they handle these cases because I've known women in that position that wouldn't even talk to the police, especially in homeless conditions, because of the lack of trust, that they would truly be regarded and respected as a woman and what took [STREET].",portland
05_03_2017,homeless,I think it's a real mark on us and how we perform as citizens to not protect our homeless people better. And I think we can do a lot better. And I think the police really should focus on it as a very important priority.,portland
05_03_2017,affordable housing,"It's not allowed. Even if we had a process to give people units from the pool and make this condition go away, that provision was only intended for these sort of nonprofit, like, visible affordable housing providers, et cetera. The other criteria for the [ORGANIZATION] plan were met or did not apply on an industrial sanctuary or legislative project.",portland
05_23_2018,affordable housing,"and we were all hungry and it's early. And the very first question they asked me, and Commissioner [PERSON], you will appreciate this, the very first question was tell us about your affordable housing strategy.",portland
05_23_2018,homeless,"I want to acknowledge and invite forward our first panel, [ORGANIZATION], Deputy Director of [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] Manager,  We also have [ORGANIZATION], who's the Director of [ORGANIZATION] at Home Forward, who I think is on the second panel, but he's crashing the first panel. So welcome as well. And, PERSON3, take it away.",portland
05_23_2018,homeless,"I'm very proud to introduce the presenters for [ORGANIZATION]. Joining me are [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] Director, who will explain a little bit more about the low-income services that the ORG1 offers and how the multifamily program fits into that suite of services, and [PERSON], the ORG2 Director at ORG3, to walk you through how our agreement connects the Water ORG1 to a trusted and existing program. And then in our second panel, we will hear from [LOCATION] from [ORGANIZATION] on his perspective of how multifamily assistance programs benefits the communities that he serves.",portland
05_23_2018,affordable housing,"Mayor, commissioners, thanks for the opportunity to be here. [ORGANIZATION] is the public housing authority that serves [ORGANIZATION]. We develop, own, and manage affordable housing and run a variety of rent assistance programs, the largest being [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_23_2018,homeless; homelessness,"We know that expanding our efforts to keep people from becoming homeless is a critical component of our broader efforts to end homelessness in our community. When we can intervene to prevent eviction, it limits devastating disruptions that families experience when they're displaced or experience homelessness. Preventing eviction enables families to maintain connections at school and at work and in their social networks.",portland
05_23_2018,homelessness,"And we know that it's less expensive than finding new housing once a family is forced into homelessness. We look forward to building this partnership over [ORGANIZATION], working with [ORGANIZATION] and our agency partners to integrate this critical new resource into the existing straw service infrastructure. And we greatly value the leadership of [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner [PERSON], and this council in identifying strategies to protect the most vulnerable utilizers of our public utilities.",portland
05_23_2018,homelessness,"If I had one extra dollar [DATE] left from the budget, I would put it into straw because we've seen the results in preventing people from losing their tenancy, preventing people from falling into homelessness, or rapidly rehousing people, as you've noted. So it's a great program, and we look forward to the partnership. Mayor, I have two other invited guests to bring forward.",portland
05_23_2018,homelessness,"There are many things I love about [ORGANIZATION], but what makes [ORGANIZATION] unique, what sets us apart from other major cities, is our city's ability to take on difficult issues and find innovative solutions. Living wage ordinances, ban the box, investing in our infrastructure, and most recently, I have watched you grapple with homelessness. And [ORGANIZATION]...  You're bringing forward three resolutions that takes on the difficult issues of the evolving [ORGANIZATION] industry.",portland
05_23_2018,homelessness,"Our earnings are erratic and often fall below minimum wage after driver expenses. And between high insurance deductibles, driver safety, and many other issues, the liability and risks that we assume as drivers is significant. These risks can push us into poverty or homelessness in the event of a catastrophic event such as an accident.",portland
05_23_2018,homeless,"You know, we all love each other and do things to help each other. We also are owner-operated, and it started out with the vets from World War II, you know, forming this company. And now we have drivers that are homeless.",portland
05_23_2018,houseless,"My commitment is to...  bring forward effective communication skills to help people have healthier relationships in their lives. The first time I made this jump, soon after I moved to [ORGANIZATION], I fell flat on my face. I ended up houseless.",portland
05_23_2018,houseless,"I was a very privileged houseless person in that I had a minivan, right? I had friends who looked out for me. But outside of that, right now, [ORGANIZATION] is how I am making my life work in terms of having the foundations covered so that [STREET] I can then be the entrepreneur that I need to be, be available for my clients that I'm slowly building, and working.  doing the work that I am here to do in this world and it is my life's demand.",portland
05_23_2018,houseless,"And for me, that's terrifying because I do not wanna end up houseless again. And I have to, once I turned [ORGANIZATION], none of my birthdays really had an impact, but when I turned [ORGANIZATION], I was like, it's now or not. I have to bring my gifts forward.",portland
04_27_2016,homelessness,"If not, then it comes back [ORGANIZATION] in second reading with your follow-up, please. Now let's move on to [LOCATION]. Amend contracts with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, and ORG3 to add $842,500 in rent assistance for people experiencing homelessness.",portland
04_27_2016,homeless; homelessness,"These funds are  will rapidly expand our providers' resource capacity to assist with permanent housing placement for people experiencing homelessness and eviction prevention for people at imminent risk of becoming homeless. [ORGANIZATION] has already obligated a significant portion of this to our nonprofit service providers under current contracting authority.

04_27_2016,homeless,"The thing is, I would like to... It seems like joining all these organizations have received a lot of money in [ORGANIZATION], and I'd actually like to see where that money's going to. How, you know, is it going to actually house...  150 homeless or is it going to go into some director's pocket?",portland
04_27_2016,homeless,Thanks. So this is money that's going out the door through those organizations to actual rent assistance to people that need it. So most of the money is actually going directly to pay rent for people that are vulnerable to becoming homeless.,portland
04_27_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"I don't want to repeat all the concerns, so let me just add the concern of subsidized housing units that  that are at risk because of this rezoning. There are several units of subsidized housing in [ORGANIZATION] that are right in the rezoning area that I feel may be lost by any new development that would come in. And at a time when homelessness and affordable housing are such concerns, I would hate to see even more residents of this rich and diverse neighborhood displaced.",portland

04_27_2016,affordable housing,"Yeah. It's all commercial, and in fact, it's not at all. There's many, many residences in there, and it remains a [STREET] of affordable housing options, and we hope that it can change, and then when it develops out, it'll be able to develop in situations that are not just studio apartments.",portland
04_27_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] recently published a set of affordable housing recommendations that includes revising [ORGANIZATION]'s zoning code and zoning map to allow for more missing middle housing types in the city's residential neighborhoods. In many ways, proximity has become the equivalent of opportunity in our city. The closer you are to good schools, active parks, and well-paying jobs, the greater your chances for success.",portland
04_27_2016,affordable housing,"As such, the discussion about affordable housing can't just be about how much housing we have, but where that housing is located. Recent research shows that kids from poor families who lived in mixed-income neighborhoods do better in school and earn more money over their lifetimes than kids who live in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty. At the same time, kids from more affluent families acquire social and emotional skills like curiosity, collaboration, and empathy that help them succeed later in life.",portland
04_27_2016,affordable housing,"The benefits extend to the entire region, allowing a diversity of housing types in our neighborhoods will promote affordability, make our community more walkable, and reduce carbon emissions. And by reducing the need for people to commute long distances from places where housing costs less, mixed-income neighborhoods can reduce traffic congestion and improve movement of freight throughout the region. And the best part about revising the zoning code is that unlike the vast majority of other affordable housing solutions, it doesn't cost a dime.",portland

And then the third point they wanted me to offer for your consideration was,  If we take all the industrial land for housing all the new people that are coming up here, won't we have more homeless? Because no industry-type jobs like welders that pay well for people who are different learners – I can't tell what schools – I went to a [ORGANIZATION] school – for people who are different learners –  So they didn't go to a regular type college but still want to support a family.",portland

03_14_2018,housing crisis,"There are proponents of density and development who want us to believe that our housing crisis is just a simple question of supply and demand, which is false. Because when you have a gross product mismatch between what is being supplied at $120, which is above the median income,  And the demand, which is below 100 median family income, it doesn't – we may see softening at the top of the market. And, in fact, we see fairly high vacancy at the top of the market.",portland
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"It's tough to perhaps nearly impossible to build at 60% to 80% right now, given just the cost of land and the expense of construction.

And finally, I would like to add that I also am very interested in  the possibility of bumping affordable housing developments in the private market ahead in the queue as an additional incentive.",portland
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"The whole concept, the idea that all the affordable housing is in one building.  rather than scattered throughout buildings all throughout the city. I really, really can't say enough about that concept. And, you know, the affordable units or subsidized, whatever you want to call the units in a building that has market rate units,  they have the opportunity to do things such as not put in granite countertops and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floors and things like that and make these units so that their maintenance and their upkeep and the cost of just constructing them within this space  that's going to be market rate, there's a lot of things that they can do.",portland

[ORGANIZATION]'s own staff recommended to ORG2 that keeping with the original CM2 designation was the best idea, but ORG2 decided to move forward with the CM3 zoning anyway. ORG3, which operates the affordable housing on FAC0, has told [ORGANIZATION] that they can only afford to build the CM2 size and were fine with the original designation.",portland

03_14_2018,affordable housing,"Yeah, please. We have a package before us of upzoning some affordable housing developments, and the theory there is we want to give people the ability to serve even more people. You are proposing to partner with [ORGANIZATION] to build on your footprint, correct?",portland
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"The church was also the previous owner of that property and sold it to [ORGANIZATION] at a discount so that we could provide homeownership opportunities to low-income working families. In fact, Mayor [PERSON], you may remember speaking at the key ceremony [ORGANIZATION] when we were selling those seven homes. The church is again willing to consider selling property to [ORGANIZATION] at a discounted price, which is very exciting given the challenges affordable housing developers face in finding property in [LOCATION]'s housing market.",portland

So, colleagues, I'm new to this conversation, and some people that we respect really highly regarding the community have started to think about this.",portland
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"And the concept that really has drawn me in is that we have nonprofit providers in our community that are land rich and are currently having trouble recruiting people for certain positions because of the housing market. And the idea that [ORGANIZATION] and others are thinking about is what if we leveraged the land on our campus  to build affordable housing so that we were able to offer someone not just a job but a [STREET] to live that's also conveniently located. There are a multitude of nonprofit entities that are in the same situation where they're competing for a workforce that's being pushed out of the community that are rich in land, and it seemed to me that it's –  a very big discussion that we ought to start engaging.",portland
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"There are six [ORGANIZATION] churches that gave me their property addresses. And so with the partnership with [ORGANIZATION], we are looking at all of these parcels and looking at what we think we could actually develop in terms of the numbers of units.  of affordable housing and essentially use our land that we own outright as equity to put into the deals and then figure out how to use a combination of low-income tax credits and traditional financing and then find equity financing that would enable us to bridge that gap to build really targeted workforce housing.

03_14_2018,affordable housing,"Now the city proposes to rezone the house across the [STREET], which also has as its neighbor an apartment complex, which for [ORGANIZATION] I've seen no one except ethnic minorities and single mothers live in. And between that and the rent law proposals, it seems the city proposes to make it safer for single homeowners to [ORGANIZATION] rather than rent rooms, while simultaneously sacrificing affordable Section 8 and affordable housing to developers one building at a time, reflecting on what she said earlier. Okay.",portland
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"I've spent my whole career just about in housing development and affordable housing development, and I'm very keen to that issue.

And those are jammed parking on [ORGANIZATION] [TIME].",portland
03_14_2018,affordable housing,tall uh we welcome redevelopment we think that the school probably is not safe especially for children so we're looking forward to redevelopment and we especially welcome affordable housing it's a great site with schools and good transit so it's going to be an asset we're also appreciative of the fact that the city is the developer with non-profits we hope for much better development than we'd see with a for-profit developer quite frankly  We're [ADDRESS].,portland
03_14_2018,affordable housing,"Oh, I just have one more thing. I wanted to thank everyone that came to testify [ORGANIZATION] because it was a really pleasant...  and very informative and I just appreciate how thoughtful everyone was and I didn't hear anyone really kind of advocating strictly for their own benefit.

05_18_2016,homeless,"We've created it with a crazy real estate market. People need to have rent stabilization. Some people have no other hope.  of not becoming homeless other than to have the government say, you know, if your property taxes went up zero and everything else about your property went up zero, at this time we can't have you kick your tenants out so that you can increase the rent 40%.",portland
05_18_2016,homeless,"Okay, item 509, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding improving the homeless situation. PERSON1, you hear?",portland
05_18_2016,homeless,"It does a lot of good things, but what it doesn't do is make sure that we reverse the decline of the workforce in [ORGANIZATION]. The other thing it doesn't do is create a new [STREET] for dealing with people who are homeless on our streets other than either ignoring the problem or arresting them. And the need for a diversion program is real.",portland
05_18_2016,homeless,"Secondly, [ORGANIZATION] in particular is literally on the front lines in our effort  to try to stem gang violence. Unfortunately, we had an incident not long ago in which four young people were shot and wounded inside the [INSTITUTION], I think highlighting how serious the situation is there and the need. Meanwhile, [ORGANIZATION] has opened a family [INSTITUTION] basically just across the [STREET].",portland
05_18_2016,homeless,"In essence, there has been no consultation with [ORGANIZATION] about this plan of approach. And while I appreciate Commissioner [PERSON]'s.  raising these concerns i don't think it's appropriate to sort of prejudge the best [STREET] to accomplish the housing outreach that she desires is by placing this money in oni and so i'm proposing that we [STREET] the money in contingency we charge [ORGANIZATION] which has not been consulted on this and also the proposed joint office for homeless services which is also on the home for everyone which has also had no input on this that all these organizations  work together no presupposition about where the money lands but come up with the best outreach plan possible bring that back to council by [ORGANIZATION] for us to consider it and then take the money put the 350 000 in the contingency until we sign off on that plan  I think that is something that reflects a truly consensus approach to this and will result in, I think, the wisest expenditure of these dollars to achieve the much-needed outreach about housing in our city.",portland
05_18_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"[STREET] it in contingency, charge the affected bureaus to come up with a plan that makes sense, not to prejudge that it's going to go to one bureau and then they have to, you know, call the shots. So I think if we're really interested in achieving the best outreach about what we're doing on housing, affordable housing development and homeless services, we should charge those bureaus to come back with a non-biased plan about how best to do the job  and then let council approve it by [ORGANIZATION] out of contingency. So I vote aye.",portland
05_18_2016,homeless,"Here's how I come down. Two things. One, thanks to your leadership, Commissioner [PERSON], we are moving most of the homeless services staff out of [ORGANIZATION] and over to the county.",portland
05_18_2016,homelessness,"And there are people in my office who spend a great deal of time dealing with homelessness issues, and we work a lot with neighborhoods. So I think it's not an unreasonable idea for [ORGANIZATION] to lead this work. I think it does have to come back to council.",portland
05_18_2016,homeless,"no no sorry no i'm voting no one voting for commissioner [ORGANIZATION]'s uh uh the mayor version of the before we take a vote on the amendment to commissioner [ORGANIZATION]'s motion i have a friendly amendment okay  which is I do like the language as I read it in [PERSON]'s substitute about the proposed city-county joint office playing a role. I know it's implied, but could we make that explicit, that [ORGANIZATION], the proposed city-county joint office for homeless services, and the home for everyone be consulted in that outreach?",portland

05_18_2016,homeless,"but also with all of the affected parties okay roll call on Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposed budget note language as further amended well I appreciate the efforts as I said my concern is there's been no consultation with [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] and there's a prejudgment about which is the best ORG2 to conduct necessary housing And I don't feel this idea is really fully baked, so I vote no.",portland
05_18_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,We have committed record funding to address affordable housing and homelessness.

05_18_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"so i think you've done a great job mayor even though there was a fundamental disagreement about the fact that we have record revenue surplus revenues and the need for a new revenue source so i think you've got most of what you're getting in your budget  I particularly want to laud the restoration of 13 firefighters to general fund away from a federal grant, very critical positions, and the record investment under Mayor [PERSON]'s leadership in housing and homeless services.

05_18_2016,homeless,"[TIME] we learned that the voters approved a major investment in [STREET] repair and traffic safety putting an end to [ORGANIZATION] of futility on those issues. DATE1 the [ORGANIZATION] is approving a budget. that, first of all, as my colleagues have said, makes major investments in housing and homeless facilities and services.",portland
05_18_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"And I think it's worth calling some of that out. The budget includes over $29 million in new investments in housing, which is a 74% increase over the [ORGANIZATION] revised budget, 156% increase over the DATE1 budget. those new investments include 14.4 million for the housing investment fund which we use to develop or preserve affordable housing over 12 million for projects prioritized by the home for everyone collaboration including support for homeless veterans shelters and housing placement services 690 000 for costs related to maintaining and improving homeless campsites and additional funds for home repair grants home",portland
05_18_2016,homelessness,"In fact, we learn so much that we then followed up on those meetings and had a [ORGANIZATION] here in [ORGANIZATION], organized by [ORGANIZATION], thank you, that brought together the mayors of the major [ORGANIZATION] cities to talk about climate change and about housing and homelessness, and the Secretary of [ORGANIZATION] and the head of [ORGANIZATION] showed up for the meeting. And I learn a lot in those discussions. And one of the things that has become so clear for me in that context is that the world is moving to cities, not just this one, but the world is obviously moving here too.",portland
05_18_2016,affordable housing,"DATE0 we will again act on school funding, and I'm really happy that we're spending over $100 million on three of our high schools to put them in good shape. And I really do believe we need to have more money for affordable housing.

05_18_2016,homeless,"I don't know what the exact reason for that is, why the homeless people have to be out on FAC0 and pushed around by the police. I've never actually researched that particular block, but we generally know that vacant blocks get maintained by the [ORGANIZATION]. The same [ORGANIZATION], which in its budget, is apparently doing some weird deal with [ORGANIZATION] to fence off and rent space under FAC1  near [LOCATION].",portland
05_18_2016,affordable housing,"And this budget...  has a lot of things that I like in it and obviously no budget is perfect, but I also want to acknowledge that we did make your job more difficult by bumping the [ORGANIZATION] to 45 for affordable housing. And that that had a domino effect in other priorities within the [ORGANIZATION]. When we made the change to take housing out and to focus on economic development, I think at the time it was the right call.",portland
05_18_2016,affordable housing,"I think as we look at manufactured home parks as an affordable housing option, particularly in some of the ones that we're going to be trying to save, and if they then become more of a long-term option,  there may be an opportunity to add one or two more spaces that would add one or two more affordable homes.

Whereas everyone deserves an opportunity to rebuild their lives, reach their fullest potential, and become productive members of society, and whereas an estimated 70 million Americans have a criminal record, and over 600,000 are released from prison [DATE], and whereas justice-involved individuals often struggle to find housing, secure employment, pursue higher education, regain voting rights, and regain financial freedom,  and whereas justice-involved individuals are disproportionately represented in [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless and unemployed populations, and whereas people of color are disproportionately represented in [PERSON]'s prison system and face even higher barriers once they are released,  and whereas we are all safer when justice-involved individuals are given every opportunity to access stable homes, secure employment, and rebuild their lives.

04_27_2017,affordable housing,"Those will now begin to take effect and will help us steer and make sure that affordable housing happens where it's in proximity to  neighborhoods that are walkable, that are well-connected by transit and other options. So this, too, is an important part of how we grow in ways that reduce carbon emissions but also provide quality of life and affordability for all of our residents. The comprehensive plan is now in [STREET].",portland
04_27_2017,affordable housing,"And I want to mention that it's been a pleasure to begin working with Commissioner [PERSON] around an accessory dwelling unit project, which is going like gangbusters, I have to say. I feel like I'm supposed to be facilitating mostly running behind this 30 or 40 people that span the spectrum from architects to bankers to developers and people working for advocacy for seniors in affordable housing. So you'll hear more about that in the future.",portland
04_27_2017,affordable housing,"And so I'm wondering if somewhere in this plan, you're looking at the impacts of our lack of affordable housing, at how displacement is affecting our climate plan, because we have so many workers who are forced out to the outskirts or out of the city altogether. That would be a really interesting...  frame for this for me personally. Some of the work we did in the development of the comprehensive plan, which you didn't have the benefit of sitting through [TIME] of work as some of the rest of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"By including students in multiple events per year, this program provides the practice necessary to build confidence and have one's voice heard. This advocacy practice also takes the form of questions at the microphone at [ORGANIZATION], where I've seen future leaders bravely ask questions about gun control, legislation protecting undocumented immigrants, affordable housing, and the lack of affordable arts opportunities in [ORGANIZATION]. These questions again build confidence.",portland
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"But, again, in terms of tax breaks, I think it's pretty important to know when the city is actually giving people a break on taxes. We do it for affordable housing. but I'm pretty sure we haven't done it for fossil fuels.",portland

04_15_2015,affordable housing,"Now, pertaining to affordable housing, one of the concerns I have is that the 30 percent MFI are below. We're not meeting the inventory out in the marketplace. We're meeting the inventory from private developers for a higher MFI.",portland
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"And I think we need to plan aggressively on the affordable housing issue to meet this demand, like [ORGANIZATION] has done in their location, like FAC1 has done in their location. As I would propose that we set aside the purchase of [ORGANIZATION] at 715 Northwest Hoyt, approximately 13 acres, and designated that toward 30% medium MFI,  and develop that whole parcel out for that purpose. We have a lot of area there to work from, we have a lot of land, and we can build a tremendous amount of affordable units at 30% MFI.",portland

04_15_2015,affordable housing,"But four of them struck us as things that we needed to provide a little additional information to enrich the community's understanding and yours. So I want to speak directly. briefly to these four things exemptions plans for spending what's the deal about the commercial rates and what's this business about [ORGANIZATION] is based on size of housing exemptions the question is are we changing exemptions and we are making no changes to the existing exemption for park [ORGANIZATION]'s for affordable housing we're making no changes to the exemption for tenant improvements and folks this is one to remember the significance of that little phrase if you're planning on overhauling and moving into new business space  Some jurisdictions will charge you a new [ORGANIZATION] for that change in use, basically a tenant improvement.",portland
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"I'm also pleased that you've not only reaffirmed the exclusion for affordable housing, but you put the campus housing issue on the table, and I think you've made a very compelling rationale for that. So I'm pleased that that's in your proposal. Two questions.",portland
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"And third, as [ORGANIZATION] indicated, we're not breaking new ground here. There are a number of jurisdictions around the country of comparable size using a similar methodology. Regarding exemptions, we strongly support a continuation of the existing exemption for affordable housing so that we can ensure that the neediest Portlanders have a [STREET] to live.",portland
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"So I think there are ways that we can stretch the dollars and still acquire land. And just as [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] have entered into a compact to work more closely to integrate their missions, so too should ORG2,  [PERSON], all four bureaus get together and figure out how they can meld their missions to actually create situations where you have parkland as well as addressing some of the issues related to stormwater and so forth. All of that said, the city should continue to aggressively acquire as much additional acreage needed to serve our citizens and protect our natural landscapes, and we strongly support the exemption for affordable housing.",portland
04_15_2015,homeless,"We care about the quality and affordability of the city's housing, neighborhoods, communities, and park systems.

I would be remiss if I failed to thank Commissioners [PERSON] and [PERSON] for their advocacy for [ORGANIZATION]. Please approve the methodology update so that this work can continue.",portland
04_15_2015,affordable housing,"And what about the situation that Mr. [PERSON] mentioned where it's the same square footage, but we're dividing one apartment into two? I think we need to look at that in terms of what is the actual building permit, and we can get a response back. I also heard him say something about affordable housing, and I wasn't sure if he was qualified under that exemption.",portland

05_27_2015,homeless,"Go ahead. And this is in regard to [ORGANIZATION], right? Well, [ORGANIZATION]'s running a lot of these homeless raids.",portland
05_27_2015,affordable housing,as our housing costs rise and as we try to deal with the questions of affordable housing. So this council will be meeting in work session to dig into those issues in detail to look at the total impact of everything that we do on both the cost side of housing and on what we can do to improve the opportunities for people to still be able to afford to live either as homeowners or renters in our city as [ORGANIZATION] becomes more and more popular. Thank you.,portland
05_27_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"The first is that the recommendation continues the exemption for low-income housing in our community. We have an affordable housing crisis in our community, and let's not kid ourselves. It is primarily a function of people that have either no money or less than 30% of medium family income.",portland
05_27_2015,affordable housing,"We can debate the various strategies for preserving a middle class in our community and the value of investing in workforce housing. But the crisis in our community is at zero to 30, is the poorest of the poor, and this recommendation continues an exemption for affordable housing, which I strongly support. Second, it, for the first time, scales the [ORGANIZATION] to the size of the houses.",portland
05_27_2015,affordable housing,"I'm very grateful for the deep commitment to affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION].

04_21_2015,homeless,"I was homeless, living in a car for [ORGANIZATION] due to no fault of my own.  before I became a cab driver.

04_21_2015,homeless,"I also lease my car out to individuals who are also formerly homeless now, thanks to the taxi industry. So this industry has literally saved my lives and the lives of others.

04_21_2015,homeless,"I will not be able to do that if I become homeless again. We've seen in [ORGANIZATION] that since [ORGANIZATION] reached saturation... Taxi drivers have seen a decrease in 35 to 80% in their fares, yet those drivers for the taxi companies are still making 30 to 60% more than [ORGANIZATION] drivers because [ORGANIZATION] cuts its prices to push out the competition, which puts its drivers at an economic disadvantage.",portland
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"and then i am happy to talk about any other other issues you want to bring up so this is uh the quick summary of the um the topics we were asked to come back and address And we'll walk through them, but the issues were that we had a summary of the impact of the changes to affordable housing. We were asked about parks and transportation.",portland
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"So now moving on to the summary of [ORGANIZATION], and without getting into all the –  The details here, people can read these, but FAC1 is a super block, so it's basically two city blocks, a very large block in the central district of [ORGANIZATION] that was purchased by [ORGANIZATION]. So it's an [ORGANIZATION] property. And then around, you see the timeline in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] acquired [ORGANIZATION] –  So not the land, but the rights to develop above a future garage for affordable housing.",portland
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"One would be an affordable housing tower. There would be [ORGANIZATION] administrative offices in that we would then at that time have to contribute our share of that garage, which was estimated to be $4 million. So when  Once again, we paid the money up front for the air rights.",portland
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"And then, of course, the streetcar was funded in part from tax increment here. We've had –  Relative to other renewal areas, significantly less investment in this area, in loans to businesses, affordable housing, and you can see other types of community development, kind of smaller grant activity that we do, particularly in our neighborhood renewal areas. [ORGANIZATION] has been very clear in expressing desire to make investments in projects  in growing the business base within this urban renewal area, given what they believe has been a front-loaded investment in things like parks, like the FAC0 and the streetcar.",portland
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"It does. The number's big, but it's just like any other transaction. If we are able to go in and buy that property, we would need to hold it, do all sorts of things, master plan it, do the proper [STREET] of soliciting interest in the property, making sure that the needs of the community are met, so whether there's additional open space requirements, affordable housing requirements, etc.  there's rights of [STREET] that need to be developed so it's it will not be flipped which was what was characterized here in the last hearing we had it will be either money in the best scenario money that we invest and get back out",portland
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"Well, I –  First off, if we're improving the value of publicly owned land, the sale would benefit both taxpayers, ratepayers. But that's also the same question that we're having about what are the community benefits for our development. And we've talked about affordable housing.",portland
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"And since there is just one other major landowner other than this. And I'm sorry, and Commissioner [PERSON] has, you know, he's already put out the covenant around affordable housing, right? I think as I shared with all of you after our last hearing that, you know, if the fire bureau property does transfer, then I intend to make sure there's a covenant, a deed restriction that requires that affordable housing be developed on that  fire bureau property.",portland
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"We've had, actually, collective master planning conversations. I don't believe we've crossed over to the stage of a development agreement, but they've been part of our conversations around [ORGANIZATION]  around what development is possible in that full triangle. And in the information that you've given us, there's some breakout about how much might go to affordable housing, how much might go to transportation infrastructure, et cetera, off the $20 million.",portland
03_12_2015,affordable housing,yeah no idea what's going to be developed there or when and and i think that there's it's probably room to have um to have the the intent expressed now about there being affordable housing and and other outcomes,portland
03_12_2015,affordable housing,"So we were now going to open the floor to amendments on any of these items that council members want to bring forward. If it's appropriate, I would offer an amendment that says, upon the transfer of any fire bureau land in [ORGANIZATION], an affordable housing covenant be recorded against the deed.

05_16_2018,affordable housing,"We can form a 501c3 and get half the money for this thing, okay, because there's the opportunity of development along this trail, affordable housing as well as market rate housing. You already see six projects going on right now, okay? But how do we get there?",portland
05_16_2018,homeless,"So I've lived here since [ORGANIZATION]. I've definitely noticed a couple of issues that really stand out.

05_16_2018,affordable housing,"In addition to creating more opportunities, the ability to add density specifically for affordable housing projects makes it more likely for those projects to pencil out because a [ORGANIZATION] like [ORGANIZATION] can spread the land acquisition cost across more units. And so being able to do that specifically for an affordable housing project  and not allowing that ability for a market rate developer makes non-profit [ORGANIZATION], affordable housing development, more feasible and makes it easier for them to compete on the open market. So we really hope that this will be a precedent, a replicable model where the city can look at other properties owned by all of its bureaus that have unused residential density, even on properties that are never going to be used for housing, like a parks community garden, and see,",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"I am the [ORGANIZATION] Director at [ORGANIZATION], and we would like to thank you, the ORG1, and ORG2 for your vigorous efforts to preserve and enhance [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing. In particular, [TIME], we'd like to thank ORG1er [ORGANIZATION] and her staff for shepherding the zoning density transfer through the planning process. And what I would like to share with you are some details about [ORGANIZATION] and the populations that we serve.",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"Established in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has worked to provide stable, affordable housing and community programs to thousands of families who would otherwise have been displaced by the forces of gentrification in northeast [ORGANIZATION]. Currently, our resident demographics resemble what northeast [ORGANIZATION] looked like in [LOCATION]. So our population is approximately 70% African American, and most of whom have lived in the neighborhood for DATE2.",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] also established [ORGANIZATION]'s first land trust and limited equity lease purchase programs and developed 115 units of rental housing that allows low-income families and individuals to stay in their neighborhoods. It is incumbent upon [ORGANIZATION] as a small community-based organization to create unique partnerships and approaches to...  the development of affordable housing. When ORG2 approached [ORGANIZATION] with the idea of purchasing the property and increasing its potential density, we welcomed the opportunity as a chance to further our mission and provide much needed affordable home ownership opportunities in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood.",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"Also, allowing for a nine-unit housing development as opposed to seven units of housing will ensure that this project is feasible and sustainable, and we look forward to its fruition. Thank you again for your consideration in support of affordable housing. Thank you.",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"We have said that in the central city. So that's going to open up hundreds of units of housing, which the city can decide how it is allocated, and which will make inclusionary housing and a lot of other affordable housing feasible just like this. We're also, [ORGANIZATION], since you mentioned it, let's get it in before the comprehensive plan changes, we're going to do another zoning code change [ORGANIZATION] saying that for all the properties that were previously residentially zoned and are now going to be open spaced outside of the central city, that those units don't just disappear.",portland

05_16_2018,affordable housing,"I was in reflection of [TIME] as I was at [ORGANIZATION] offering testimony on the residential infill project. I arrived here in [ORGANIZATION] and got my start actually in affordable housing working with [ORGANIZATION] and the crew at [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. So affordable housing was a critical issue for low-income residents and communities of color [ORGANIZATION] and clearly  clearly from this [TIME]'s agenda, items in front of you is also a critical issue [LOCATION] as well.",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"I'm the Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION]. I would love to just offer the thought that it is my belief that housing authorities should be standing shoulder to shoulder with community advocacy groups around the issues of affordable housing and social and racial justice and all of the...  that impact folks both who receive our housing assistance and those who need it. And unfortunately, that dynamic is not common between housing authorities and the advocacy community.",portland
05_16_2018,homeless,"We've diversified our membership and leadership to bring it in line with the demographics of the community which we serve. Finally, because of this funding, we were able to be a productive partner with [ORGANIZATION] to ensure plans for the new shelter on [ORGANIZATION] will make it the best shelter in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to thank you very much for restoring [ORGANIZATION] funds and providing ongoing financial stability to this program and the business districts like [ORGANIZATION] that depend on it.",portland
05_16_2018,houseless,"I've lived in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION]. I've personally witnessed intense harassment of my family and friends of color, police-initiated interactions that end in arrest that were completely unnecessary. I work at FAC0 and FAC1, where there's a mission that serves the houseless, and witness [LOCATION] sweeps, police incidents there.",portland
05_16_2018,homeless; houseless,"And I don't mean policed intervention. I mean things like acute mental health treatment beds at [ORGANIZATION]. By listening to the community, particularly the houseless community, which you referenced, we've actually added a liaison position in the police bureau to work with and help establish policy  around the homeless interactions.",portland
05_16_2018,homeless,"We've asked for data collection, auditing resources, and accountability. All of that also gets funded within the [ORGANIZATION]. And importantly, we've made record investments, substantial increases around homeless service.",portland
05_16_2018,houseless,"And that doesn't include other issues they have had to deal with, which I know you guys know about this stuff, consistent crime related to issues such as car prowls, vandalism, and theft. The growing problem of continual houseless camping and campsite growth, waking up and having to wake up people and ask them, sleeping in the doorway, to move and being verbally threatened. The business license taxes generate more than $100 million DATE0 to fund city services, and as you know, contributed to a nice $22.7 million budget surplus for [LOCATION].",portland
05_16_2018,houseless,"But what we would like to see is using the surplus more. Much as you said already, to clean up the city, the trash everywhere is not helpful, and it's a little disgusting. To make some better efforts to hold the houseless and transient populations accountable for their actions, we don't really see a lot of that happening.",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"And part of the reason that a lot of people are not here to participate  also express their disapproval of the increase in the police budget, but I would just like to say that  I am again here to demand an immediate freeze on new [ORGANIZATION] hires instead of the 49 new positions proposed, as well as to disarm, defund, and dismantle the police to create real safety in our communities. And I know that we disagree on a lot of the ways that safety is considered by different communities, but I think that...  Part of the issue is that the increases in what you were saying before, the new maybe affordable housing that might be coming in [ORGANIZATION], it's just not enough. It's not enough.",portland
05_16_2018,homeless,"We've increased our contribution to [ORGANIZATION] by at least $3 million, maybe a little bit more. About $5 million. Oh, about $5 million.",portland
05_16_2018,homelessness,"Wow. I didn't get that memo. We're serving more people facing challenges around affordability, eviction, and homelessness than ever.",portland
05_16_2018,homeless,"Unfortunately, what the city and county are actually doing to address houselessness gets lost in distracting debates about [ORGANIZATION] and other well-intentioned but not well-informed approaches. Investing $31.2 million in [ORGANIZATION] will fund the hard work that doesn't make headlines, but does make a critical difference for thousands of our most vulnerable community members. As previously noted, we're also increasing the business license tax for the first time in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_16_2018,homeless,"The rising tide of prosperity in [ORGANIZATION] is clearly not lifting all boats. In fact, as the increasing number of people who are insecure in their housing and becoming homeless demonstrates, things are getting worse, not better, for many people in [ORGANIZATION]. Increasing the [PERSON] now is a great first step toward recognizing how we can divert part of that rising tide to help the people who are struggling to stay afloat and ultimately create a safer, more equitable, and prosperous city for all of us.",portland
05_16_2018,houseless,And there are some wins in the police budget. We're getting two additional behavior health unit teams. We're creating a houseless community engagement liaison position.,portland
05_16_2018,homeless,"I'm very pleased we're shifting $4 million from one time to ongoing resources for [ORGANIZATION], while adding nearly $3 million of new funding for alternative shelter and housing placement. Let's say again what the Mayor has said several times already [ORGANIZATION]. 5,000 people off the streets and into housing in [LOCATION].",portland
05_16_2018,homeless,"6,000 people who are at risk of becoming homeless and are not. And so while, yes, there are still far too many people, far too many children outside, there are a lot of people who are not because of the work that the mayor has done in leading [ORGANIZATION] and partnering with [ORGANIZATION] in the joint office. I have voted for increased funding for [ORGANIZATION] and for these services [ORGANIZATION] of office, even during [LOCATION], and I'm proud about the...  tens of millions of dollars more that the citizens of [ORGANIZATION], the community of [ORGANIZATION] is willing to dedicate to these services.",portland
05_16_2018,homeless,"But I said when I ran and you elected me to this office to focus on certain priorities, and those priorities are addressing the homeless crisis on our streets.  addressing the housing affordability issue that continues to be a significant challenge to Portlanders.

05_16_2018,affordable housing,Yes. Presentation by [ORGANIZATION] staff on a potential regional affordable housing measure. Very good.,portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"Colleagues, as you well know, [ORGANIZATION] is in a housing emergency. In addressing this, we as a council have worked diligently with the community, with advocates and activists to craft policy and incentive development to create more housing stock while simultaneously approving methods  of stabilizing both renters and owners of housing units with a specific emphasis on affordable housing and low-income renters and homeowners. We have approved a historic housing bond, which up to this point is put into our housing pipeline for development.",portland
05_16_2018,homeless,"Over half of the promised housing, nearly 600 units, within [ORGANIZATION] of our five- to [DATE] schedule –  and [ORGANIZATION] continues to aggressively move forward to create affordable rental opportunities. We've also continued production through our use of tax increment finance in urban renewal areas and partnered with area nonprofit organizations to create additional housing for the homeless with a commitment to supportive housing, continued to produce housing for our veterans, [ORGANIZATION] families, and our youth aging out of foster care, and, of course, we look to do a lot more. Our housing emergency is marked by [LOCATION] of 5% or more rent increases in the [ORGANIZATION] area, with a smaller overall rent increase of 2% in [DATE].",portland
05_16_2018,housing crisis,"You outlined the nature of the housing crisis here in the city of [ORGANIZATION], and as this map shows, it really is also a regional challenge. The growing pains of our region have created rent increases across the metro area, across many other regions across the country as well. So [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] began a process of examining housing  The nature of the problem across the region, what cities like [ORGANIZATION] and others in our jurisdiction are doing to solve the problem, and what role [ORGANIZATION] could play.",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"We know that  much of the need for affordable housing is disproportionately experienced by communities of color, and the history of housing discrimination is long and dates back to the origination of our country. And so with this measure, we must begin to correct for those wrongs, otherwise risk perpetuating those inequities. So absolutely every part of this  framework and all of the work going forward in implementation as a region will be led by racial equity.",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"The constitutional amendment that we'll all be voting on in [ORGANIZATION] is to allow local bonds to be –  used for affordable housing created by non-profit or non-governmental entities. Currently, the Constitution says that if it's a public bond, the public entity has to own that in perpetuity. Is that approximately correct?",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"So the supportive housing programming will be made possible through partnerships with our, especially our county, our three counties, who will help to partner and leverage those services in conjunction with the future homes. But we absolutely agree, and [ORGANIZATION] is committed to finding that, to, to, Creating those partnerships and committing those resources in conjunction with these future homes that we can ensure that we are serving the community members We intend to and ensure their success in affordable housing great because I my suspicion is that that is a question That will have to be well baked particularly with regard to the county and the support services That are to be provided a commission you [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"And that means we're getting people not just off the [STREET] and into that 0 to 30 housing, but out of unaffordable housing and into affordable housing, which then opens up that range of 50 to 80 that we still see a need, a much less great need in that 50 to 80 range. So I guess I'm interested in your thoughts on that and why...  I mean, I think we can do it, but if you think we can't, why? And I guess...",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"We know where we're planning light rail lines, where we're planning bus rapid transit, and we are able to use the limited federal dollars in the [ORGANIZATION] program to acquire lands and to work with developers to add more density  Historically, that's been the focus. Recently, we've supported the development of over 800 units of affordable housing with the [ORGANIZATION] program. So the concept is, and you were very close to this with the FAC0 proposal, how do we blend resources into that proposal to acquire lands, sometimes acquire buildings, to get ahead of displacement that could occur when values rise after the investment is made?",portland
05_16_2018,affordable housing,"In addition to the [ORGANIZATION] tax exemption provided by the [ORGANIZATION], this project will receive an exemption of the affordable housing construction excise tax that otherwise would have been due on the affordable units.

05_16_2018,homeless,"Just a comment. I'd like to thank our staff for all of the work to develop this pilot project with our partners. [ORGANIZATION] facing eviction or who have an eviction are unable to rent in our market, often become homeless if they are able to rent.",portland
05_16_2018,homelessness,"they are usually living in substandard housing.

03_22_2018,affordable housing,"I mean, we're hearing that there is going to be a slowdown for which –  We'll likely be blamed, but I think it's called the natural cycle of things. And there's a big reference to, you know, capitalizing on inclusionary housing, which, of course, in a CX zone, there's absolutely no guarantee we'll get any affordable housing at this site. It could be many things.",portland
03_22_2018,affordable housing,This is not a development application. So we can't condition any decision that we make based on a particular development. The letters we've gotten from some of the supporters that are in the record  specifically say that their support is conditioned on this being affordable housing subject to inclusionary housing.,portland
03_22_2018,homelessness,"We created a reasonable solution that's being brought to you [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you, Mayor [PERSON], for your support and sponsorship of the amendment.

03_22_2018,housing crisis,"Before we spend a tremendous amount of money on the design of the building, we need to know for sure that our discussion with [ORGANIZATION] is limited to the contextual conditions of the materials of the building and not how many housing units we are able to build on the property. Ultimately, it is my belief that your goals and our goals are mutually aligned. We are a part of a larger team that is tasked with executing the mission of not only council's goals, but the entire community's to solve a housing crisis.",portland
03_22_2018,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is larger, so know that there are not that many, a lot of extremely affordable housing areas. [ORGANIZATION] is better known for lawless behavior than our rich history. In short, we're finding that our attempt at perfection is becoming the enemy of good.",portland
03_22_2018,affordable housing,I'll second that. I would simply say that...  i was persuaded i mean i think it's pretty unusual for [ORGANIZATION] to sort of announce ahead of time that they would not approve a proposal that reflect higher height and i think that i'm persuaded by the testimony that in order to maximize the number of affordable housing units in this proposal 200 feet does that,portland
03_22_2018,affordable housing,and i think it does provide a good taper down from the 460 feet north of the proposal to 200 feet  is then 125 feet. So I think that makes a lot of sense. But I do think the additional height and FAR are necessary to maximize the affordable housing units that will be developed under this proposal.,portland
03_22_2018,affordable housing,"I believe the 325-foot height is appropriate as long as it comes with requirements to provide public benefits, which it does, including open space, access to the river, views.  and requirements to allow visual permeability. In addition, the increased height will allow for more flexibility in design and hopefully achieve some of the public benefits we desperately need in the downtown area, including more affordable housing, open space, and access to the river. I vote aye.",portland
05_26_2016,affordable housing,"The work that's moving on affordable housing is absolutely essential for this community. We also have an idea and suggest another task force, which would be to work with the housing code and the residency laws.

05_26_2016,homelessness,"And then help us also put appropriate pressure on the private sector and the foundation nonprofit sector to be good partners for what city government does. I was in Mayor [PERSON]'s office not long ago actually talking about homelessness because we were down there visiting a facility that they've done better than what we've done.

04_23_2015,soup kitchen,"And just as a reminder, as Commissioner [PERSON] stated, a demolition permit will not be issued until a permit is issued for the replacement proposal, which is to be reviewed under a separate Type 3 land use application. So we have two precedents for Type 4 review. In [ORGANIZATION], we...  [ORGANIZATION] reviewed demolition of the FAC0 building, also known as FAC1, and in that situation, [ORGANIZATION] approved the demolition because they found that the proposed replacement facility, a soup kitchen and low-income housing and other services was the highest and best use of that site.",portland

04_06_2016,homeless,I was going to talk about homeless issues. One thing I will bring up is you have a storage bin at FAC0 that's sitting there basically vacant. These things were supposed to be used for homeless people as a day storage thing.,portland
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"Proposal for FAC0 began DATE0. This high school was closed in [LOCATION] due to low enrollment.

The clarifications are that there isn't going to –  The council's intent is that affordable housing should be exempt from the stopgap mitigation payment requirements. So I'm proposing to delete the sentence in the City Code 1150.040.C1B4.  that delete the sentence that says to be exempt from the mitigation requirement in B2, the applicant must demonstrate that the retention requirement of B1 and the tree protection specifications of 030 cannot be met with the proposed development.",portland
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"The reason for that part of this amendment is that to have  The applicant has to demonstrate that would require hiring an arborist. It would require city staff going to verify that.

04_06_2016,affordable housing,"Yeah, good [TIME] mayor and commissioners. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm director of real property at [ORGANIZATION] and  First, I'd like to say that [ORGANIZATION] is very supportive of the city's affordable housing goals.",portland
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"As you alluded to, we're currently working closely with [ORGANIZATION] on a piece of property we're getting ready to develop out in [ORGANIZATION] on the FAC0 line, requiring affordable housing on that site. We're also interested in understanding the new inclusionary zoning laws and how those are going to affect development and working with [ORGANIZATION] to understand how that would affect this site as well. Frankly, due to the quick turnaround between your conversation with the [ORGANIZATION] and this meeting DATE0, we haven't really had a chance to touch base with him on exactly what that conversation was all about, but I do have a meeting with him [PERSON] to get some clarity on that.",portland
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"and what i understand you have placed on the record and that as a condition of council acting on this is that there this this any development here will in fact uh  to conform to the city's affordable housing goals, including the inclusionary housing guidelines to be developed. That's right.",portland
04_06_2016,affordable housing,"Are there questions or concerns you have with that? Again, obviously we have more of this to work out over time and formalities, but it's really important that we have...  on the record an understanding between the city and [ORGANIZATION] that both public agencies are going to be committed to our affordable housing goals as you are in other projects so that that would apply in this case as well and those goals are set now in state law with the inclusionary zoning standard that we have still to process into our own regulations but regardless of where we are in that regulatory development process this is an agreement between the city and the [ORGANIZATION] that between the city and [ORGANIZATION] that  that's going to be the policy regardless of what the formalities are yet at the city in that ordinance development work. Right.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"But if you look at the housing statistics on who's building affordable housing and serving who in the region, if you look at the location of jobs, if you look at transportation, if you look at a number of things, the idea that we are best when the region is successful is coming under attack.  and is being questioned. And I think that when the city of [ORGANIZATION] has a chance to reach out to a regional partner and support something that benefits all of us, and particularly one that supports an important piece of our history, then it is incumbent on us to join arms with our other partners and say, yes, we'll help you.

04_01_2015,homeless,"Go ahead. We think that...  This could be used to hurt people, and the [STREET] this council has handled the homeless question and people on the streets is a disgrace, and we see this as a continuation. Mayor, you wanted to say something?",portland

04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Aye. Okay, let's move to 340. require the identification and acquisition of rights to develop affordable housing on a site in [ORGANIZATION] that will fully achieve all affordable housing goals in the district mr. [ORGANIZATION] mayor",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"I want to offer a little context for how we got to this [STREET]. There has been over [ORGANIZATION] or to [LOCATION], a very robust community discussion about,  centering on how the city fulfills commitments that were made back in DATE2 concerning affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And while originally there were a package of amendments were offered by you, Mayor, to effectively right-size urban renewal, this issue about housing came to dominate the discussions around the Fourth Amendment to the [ORGANIZATION] Urban Renewal Plan.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So the Fourth Amendment, which we'll be voting on in a little bit,  specifically calls out a development on what has been identified as parcel three and identifies the funding to make a substantial down payment towards some existing affordable housing goals. This resolution commits the council to a second development within a specified time frame with funding to complete the,  the goals that were set for zero to 60, that is people at 60% of MFI and below, the people that are currently struggling the most in our market, particularly people at the zero to 30 range, that would complete our commitment at that level and allow us to begin to stretch to other commitments that were made around affordable housing. There was some consideration given to seeking to boost the numbers at FAC0 to fit as many units as possible.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"It doesn't say that we're going to be finished in meeting affordable housing goals. And as additional resources are generated, we will continue to make progress meeting our then goals and the new goals that we've established. But I will put this in context.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"At the time that the Fourth Amendment was originally proposed, there were approximately somewhere between $7 and $9 million of [ORGANIZATION] available for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And that doesn't buy much. The action that I hope we take [ORGANIZATION] will ensure at least $47 million is allocated to two specific developments within [ORGANIZATION], down payments on meeting goals that we established in [LOCATION] and have not yet fulfilled, and putting us, I think, on a forward path to do even more.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"The second be it resolved...  paragraph now says that through second site acquisition and development, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] will fully achieve all affordable housing goals [ORGANIZATION] as defined by the DATE0 [ORGANIZATION] Rural Area Housing Development Strategy. I think that... What?",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"But again, in an excess of caution, given that we have a limited amount of money, we have other needs in the district for transportation, parks at all, I'm proposing that the be it resolved be amended to read. Now, therefore, be it resolved that through second site acquisition and development, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] will use up to $47 million in [ORGANIZATION] revenue towards achieving affordable housing goals in [ORGANIZATION], as defined by et cetera. So I'll second the amendment, Mayor, for purpose of discussion.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And I also appreciate the clarification because there was, I think, a drafting error in my resolution. There was no [STREET] we were going to fully achieve all affordable housing goals on the second site. And I think we've become so accustomed to thinking in terms of the most pressing goals as 0 to 60 that we use it interchangeably with affordable housing goals.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"When I hear the term affordable housing... In my mind, what that generates is the average earning capacity of a person in [ORGANIZATION], which is about $60,000 a year. And if you take the affordable housing, that becomes a percentage of what they pay.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So it could be...  as much as $50,000, $60,000, if they have to pay the full amount, depending on how much income they have coming in. I would like to see the wording change to low-income housing instead of affordable housing. And that has at least the implications—  that we really care about people that are struggling.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"When you say the people that are struggling in [ORGANIZATION], and if you base it on $60,000 a year, that excludes a lot of people. So if you were to change the wording on this stuff to say low-income housing, that would incorporate people that are making minimum wage that we all seem to be really worried about. And I find it offensive when I hear politicians use the phrase affordable housing because it's a con phrase.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So I want to have this a little bit better understanding on your timing on committing yourself to a purchase agreement on the additional parcels. Another issue I have on the affordable housing issues is that I have a real issue on setting height restrictions on people that want to,  build additional units for affordable housing. I want developers to have the freedom to come in with ideas for additional affordable housing units and having their height restrictions negotiated upon them doing that for the public good.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"If we want to restrict them with the [ORGANIZATION]'s, try to add additional cost to them. If we try to restrict them in other areas, the developers are going to step back and say, it doesn't make any sense to me to look at this time. I don't have any interest in affordable housing.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"We have to have the understanding that it's more advantageous to have people in housing than out on sidewalks. Again, we need to keep looking at those areas for the developers to continue to build projects, to continue to focus on affordable housing, again,  and be offered incentives on height restrictions to let them be able to develop their projects and offer more housing and not be shut down due to the limitations of heights. Thank you.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"All right. i'm [ORGANIZATION] representing [ORGANIZATION] the league appreciates commissioner [PERSON]'s efforts to give the public more certainty about meeting the [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing goals unfortunately the resolution does not go far enough the actions described will not fully achieve all the district's affordable housing goals the constrained funding model in the urban renewal plan applies to the first 3 000 units  Once that point has been reached, the comprehensive plan applies, and future housing development should match the income profile of the city as a whole. There are currently about 2,500 units, so we are fast approaching that point.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"It was clear from the beginning that because the need for infrastructure, affordable housing, and parks was so great, and the funds limited, it would be especially important to require commitments for land and infrastructure improvements from the property owners benefiting from the substantial public investment. It is not too late to make that happen. [ORGANIZATION] should start by withholding approval of the amendment until agreements with [PERSON] and ORG2 for housing sites, parks, and streets are in [STREET].",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] should transfer ownership of half of block 33 to the city for affordable housing development in lieu of repaying the $2 million in housing money it owes. [ORGANIZATION] needs to do its part to contribute to the district's housing and infrastructure needs. The ORG1 campus is situated on 20 acres of donated land and it is tax exempt.,portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Surely, [ORGANIZATION] can spare one acre for housing that would serve its lower paid workers. The remainder of the development capacity on parcel 3 should be reserved for affordable housing, particularly for units below 30% MFI. Given the [ORGANIZATION]'s lackluster performance on affordable housing to date, there is little confidence among the public that any more sites will be secured.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has been held up as a model of success. In that case, [ORGANIZATION] were adopted concurrently. For the most part, the developer and city held up their ends of the bargain, and in return for city infrastructure improvements, land was made available for parks and affordable housing.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"We're at a [STREET] because we didn't secure land early that there are few options for us and I think [ORGANIZATION] articulated what we really should be doing in the future. The resolution is seen as a win, but it really isn't. In [ORGANIZATION], the framework plan for [ORGANIZATION] was adopted, and it outlined what the affordable housing goals for the district would be if we were to follow the longstanding affordable housing policy of the city of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And that policy was something that was exemplified in the implementation of [ORGANIZATION]. We recognized that the infrastructure needs were greater in [LOCATION] and through a public process that was huge and long. We actually adopted a constrained funding model for affordable housing, constrained goals.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], the Seventh Amendment to [LOCATION] really put Block 33 as the primary real estate focus for achieving affordable housing. And at that time, [ORGANIZATION] purchased parking units, non-existent parking stalls, but parking stalls that were to be developed there. In [LOCATION], the Eighth Amendment revised that focus to be both Block 33 and Block 49.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION] actually acquired land from FAC0 investors, $5 million, and then it did a sole source development agreement with them. They acquired air rights from FAC0 investors and did a first right of refusal that they could develop the affordable housing above FAC1. Okay.",portland
04_01_2015,homelessness,"along with other former [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 staff and housing advocates. And, you know, we're here because we care deeply about [ORGANIZATION] being a city with opportunities for everyone, opportunities for people of all income levels, stages of life, to live, to work, and play in these diverse neighborhoods, including the new and emerging ones like [ORGANIZATION]. I'm also here as a volunteer on the ORG2 housing work group that's been working with the city and county staff over [ORGANIZATION] to recommend strategies to reduce homelessness in our community.",portland
04_01_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"[TIME], [ORGANIZATION], who works on homeless issues for [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], said,  was telling me, you know, it's taken veterans, sorry, PERSON2 comes back with me sometimes and I get a little emotional. It's taken veterans [ORGANIZATION] to find housing, even with vouchers, sorry, and down payments, because there just aren't enough affordable housing units.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"At 200 units an acre, that's a total of 520 units, which is basically three acres of land. You've got two acres of partial three if you choose to develop that all for affordable housing. You're currently in negotiations with another property owner for another acre of land.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So I absolutely believe if we have the three sites, we can do it. If you don't want to use all of FAC0, the only site the city still has left –  for a full affordable housing project, then you need one more site. And I agree with [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] that FAC1 is a good [STREET] to go.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,and I know that a lot of that it's going to go for Low-income or affordable housing and I think that's great. I have a  strong feelings about the need for having that in the city.,portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Well, we don't have to give you a hypothetical. The only other affordable housing development in your neighborhood is operated by [ORGANIZATION]. And it's a little bit to the south of where you live currently.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"But, yes, FAC0 is the first parcel that will be developed for affordable housing. So FAC0 includes the land that's currently empty as well as the substation land. Is that right?",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Utilize parcel three for maximum development of affordable housing. Stick to the goal committed to in [ORGANIZATION], that housing after the first 3,000 units will match the income profile of the city as a whole. And to do this, acquire sites now.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"As you know, the city is currently 270 units behind the promised production of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And by the time FAC0 is developed and 4,000 units total have been built in the district, the shortfall would be 570 units less whatever is developed on FAC0. To develop 570 homes, we need approximately three acres of land.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"If all of parcel 3 is used for affordable housing, just one more acre would be required to reach existing targets. If only half of parcel 3 is used for affordable housing and the balance for other housing, we would need two more acres. Those sites should be secured now before they become even more expensive.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"The data shows that currently we are short 23,000 units of housing affordable to people below 30% of median income. and another 600 units that were short for those [DATE] and 50 percent MFI. However, there is a surplus of 45,000 units for households [DATE], and the excess of affordable housing increases as we go higher up the income scale.",portland
04_01_2015,homeless,"We can get the rest of the development money down the [STREET]. And we can supplement [ORGANIZATION] and general fund with federal funds that include those rent subsidy contracts that can write down the rents through project-based Section 8, vouchers for homeless veterans, and a new batch of [ORGANIZATION] vouchers. In its current form, I would not personally approve, support approving the urban renewal amendment.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Some have been surprised at that, saying, well, there's $47 million in additional affordable housing money. Why wouldn't you support that? But to be clear, the net increase in tax increment for affordable housing is only $3 million, not $47 million.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Good morning. Thanks for taking all this testimony [ORGANIZATION]. I'll try to be brief because you've heard a lot already, but [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], owner-manager at [ORGANIZATION], and many other affordable apartments around the city, and affordable housing to define it, which is important.",portland
04_01_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION]. [TIME], I guess I just want to add to the conversation two points from the perspective of my current work and the perspective of my past work. Currently, leading up [ORGANIZATION], our work, we're an organization of 75 local nonprofits working to address the affordable housing crisis before our city and [LOCATION] region.",portland
04_01_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And my first assignment was to convene a survey of how other cities are funding affordable housing with local revenue strategies. Clearly, federal resources, state resources are not going far enough. Everywhere, cities around the country like ours are in the midst of this housing crisis.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And what could we do? And unfortunately, what we find is a list of revenue mechanisms that are preempted in [ORGANIZATION], preempted at the state level. And here we are with the [ORGANIZATION] set aside, which was an enormous win [ORGANIZATION] for affordable housing advocates and has brought a lot of revenue, $150 million to [PERSON] for affordable housing development.",portland
04_01_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Unfortunately, that revenue is limited to use in only our urban renewal areas. And so here we are working to find new solutions for affordable housing because clearly this conversation is evidence of the fact that our [ORGANIZATION] set-aside, while wonderful, is not going the distance to meet the need of our affordable housing crisis, of our 20,000-unit shortage in the [ORGANIZATION] area for families and individuals with less than 30 percent income. We have a lot of work to do.",portland
04_01_2015,housing crisis,"But the [ORGANIZATION] set-aside is our opportunity to do it, and the urban renewal districts are the [STREET], the opportunity for us to implement this strategy. And so I'm here to ask and encourage and thank you for finding ways to make this resource go the distance while it's the only resource we have available. And then the second point I want to bring to the conversation is from the perspective of my previous work where I was at [ORGANIZATION] pilot project for [ORGANIZATION] and cascade you behavioral health care for [LOCATION] before that working with people with very low incomes in the midst of a housing crisis.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"but we know that the conversation is the same, and the need is the same and we need more affordable housing priorities here in the city. And I appreciate the fact that the situation that we're in now is is the product of. past decisions that we may not be able to overcome.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"We have to do better on housing. our end at [ORGANIZATION], we hear on the renters' rights hotline astronomical rent increases. And there is such a dire need for people to find and keep affordable housing.",portland
04_01_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"How successful are these investments if the people that live and work and contribute to the city don't have enough opportunity to live there? And...  We really can't build our [STREET] out of this housing crisis with mostly private development. The more private development we build, that actually creates more of a need for affordable housing.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And we, as a community, can look forward not only now but in [ORGANIZATION] and see what we can do about prioritizing affordable housing. Thank you very much. Thank you.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"I am just begging you to reserve this very critical tool. Like it or not, it is a critical tool that the city has to finance affordable housing. Use it wisely.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"This resolution memorializes the diligent efforts that have occurred and will occur in the future by both [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you.  to identify an additional parcel of land to achieve our affordable housing goals for [ORGANIZATION]. As we all know, and has been so eloquently stated [TIME], the need for affordable housing has never been greater.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"Rents are rising rapidly, and many [ORGANIZATION]ers and [ORGANIZATION] families are being priced out of our city. The [ORGANIZATION] area offers a very opportunity-rich area for affordable housing to be. It's rich in transportation.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"uh it's got good schools that people young people will go to in that area and it meets all of our criteria for high opportunity area so we are determined to make sure that we meet our goals and hopefully we'll exceed our goals on affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] pleased to i thank commissioner PERSON0 for his leadership on this resolution and everybody he also thanked previously as well hi  [PERSON]? Well, Mayor, just a point of privilege, and I apologize because my handwriting is like a doctor's handwriting and sometimes I can't even read it. The reason that [ORGANIZATION] were at the table and the [ORGANIZATION] was at the table and that we were able to do a little bit of a stretch in this work is because the mayor of our city said it was important to him personally.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So I'm very pleased with this amendment. It shows true leadership by Commissioner [PERSON] to ensure that  affordable housing gets going soon, and then that there's more of it coming. And I would hope that at least one more site will be there.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"This resolution, I think, does give us the additional clarity about our implementing strategies for affordable housing. The specificity that [ORGANIZATION] came here and asked us for, I think, is now before us, and I'm very pleased to support this and vote aye. Thank you.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"The council obviously has heard extensively from the public on this package, which returns $800 million in assessed value to local taxing jurisdictions.  increases the resources for affordable housing, and advances the implementation of our affordable housing goals and helps achieve the potential of new station areas in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. Let me make some specific comments about a few of these areas. Regarding [ORGANIZATION], the area around [ORGANIZATION] is a problem.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And with regard to FAC0, I just wanted to say that we do still need some more investments for transportation. I wish we had no transportation needs and we can put all of the money into affordable housing. But despite the fact that we have a tram, despite the fact we have a streetcar, we also have a complete mess at the intersection of FAC1 and FAC2 and [PERSON], which will get much worse as development proceeds and there's more travel there.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So affordable housing is a critical need for the entire city. But unfortunately, we do have to save some of the revenue to deal with other issues, including parks and transportation. Anyway, thanks to my colleagues.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"The inclusion of the land in [ORGANIZATION],  And a firm guarantee that [ORGANIZATION], ORG1-owned land will be affordable housing. I think ensures that we will be able to bring another affordable housing project to inner southeast [ORGANIZATION]. I'm pleased to vote aye.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"I do appreciate the effort by the Commissioner [PERSON] to add an affordable housing requirement, and yet the amendment is unclear and doesn't specify exactly what that means. There's not enough evidence, in my opinion, to support an expansion of the district in this [STREET]. I was quite persuaded by the testimony from [ORGANIZATION] and the other neighborhood representatives that in addition to [ORGANIZATION], or perhaps instead of, and having a new urban renewal district along FAC0, that would have made more sense adding property along FAC1 or along [LOCATION].",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"So roll call vote, please, on FAC0. PERSON0? I've been on this council long enough to remember when we adopted the education urban renewal district, and once upon a time I had high hopes for how we might spend the affordable housing dollars in that part of town.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"We're on 336? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I would like to, I don't think [ORGANIZATION] is here or anyone from [ORGANIZATION], so I would like to at least acknowledge that because of their advocacy, we did bump up the target for the set-aside for affordable housing under this original amendment above 30%, which as we know was always a floor, to a blended rate of 42%.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And that was because, in part, because [ORGANIZATION] said that there was such an urgency, they wanted to see more money and they wanted to see the money front-loaded. And so I'm deeply appreciative that [ORGANIZATION] and his leadership at the commission led to the city adopting that framework and significantly increasing the dollars that will be allocated for affordable housing for the life of this district. All right.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"I have been very concerned all along from back when I was on [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] was under consideration that there are so many competing needs, and indeed there continue to be competing needs in this amendment. The problem that the advocates highlighted immediately was the deficit in affordable housing, and I applaud Commissioner [PERSON] for diving in and working so hard to identify the solution on Block 3, and I'm very happy to support the proposed funding for the projects at $47 million. Building on the amendment that ORG1 adopted in [ORGANIZATION] under Commissioner [PERSON]'s leadership to increase the set-aside for affordable housing in [LOCATION] to 36%.",portland
04_01_2015,affordable housing,"And particularly for affordable housing, as well as market-raised housing, there needs to be an active park in the district. Housing advocates, [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION], recognize and support this need. And again, system development charges will provide some revenue, but it won't be enough.",portland
05_06_2015,affordable housing,"And then if you look through kind of the actual feedback, what people wrote down on sticky notes or what they communicated to us in our meetings,  You can see there's some common themes that relate to affordability, affordable housing. Maybe when we get to some discussion on this, we can talk about how we should be thinking about our role in affordable housing, but currently it's not a core part of our work, but I know there's a strong sense that [ORGANIZATION] should be more involved in But then there's also this there's a series of more kind of how we do our work around committee involvement, around making sure that we're aligned with the efforts from other plans and that people like the fact that we're thinking holistically.",portland
05_06_2015,affordable housing,"I mean, you can do a lot of things, but I'm not sure you can be held accountable for boosting that by 40 percent. Or making a significant dent in homeownership, particularly when market forces and things like new underwriting guidelines make it much harder to get people into homeownership, maybe making the affordable housing rental agenda more compelling. Or the one that I think really jumped out at me is this idea that in [ORGANIZATION] you're reduced by half the number of households in high poverty neighborhoods without promoting displacement.",portland
05_06_2015,affordable housing,"For example, [ORGANIZATION] we completed our housing advocacy training. This is a project funded by [ORGANIZATION]. It brought community elders together in a series of five sessions to explore the issue of affordable housing.",portland
05_06_2015,affordable housing,"DATE0 we receive calls from older adults who cannot find affordable housing, who are being priced out of their apartments or living in unsafe environments. We wanted to explore the range of options available in our community and partnered with [ORGANIZATION] in this exploration. We took this group to the state legislature to speak with their representatives about the issue and concluded [LOCATION] with 40 people on the Fair Housing Discrimination Tour, which looks at the history of housing in our community through the lens of race.",portland
05_28_2015,homeless,"But I find that [ORGANIZATION] is in a very big hurry to demolish and destroy, whether it's very livable homes and make more homeless people, or destroy our reservoirs, the best water system in this country. Water is life. Do not destroy our reservoirs.",portland

05_22_2019,homelessness,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I manage the city's homelessness and urban camping impact reduction program. I'd like to apologize for bringing an emergency ordinance [ORGANIZATION].,portland
05_22_2019,homelessness,"We now have a clearer and more data-informed goal of reducing the impact of unsanctioned encampments. The current scope is outdated and needs to better reflect the [STREET] that our work has evolved over time and has proven most effective in our operations and engagement with individuals experiencing homelessness.

05_22_2019,houseless,"It's clear to me that... Dealing with this issue in the individually That we cannot expect that we would have up to 25 million dollars being spent on cleaning up campsites without detailed public engagement and involvement As when you spoke with me DATE0 I mentioned to you that I'm very concerned that there is  does not appear to be a path for people who are houseless [LOCATION] to be employed to help with this process.

05_22_2019,homelessness,"We, anything that is reasonably assumed to be of utility and or value, which is vague language from the Anderson Agreement, we kind of iron that out with the work, with the assistance of [ORGANIZATION] to try to define that a little bit more clearly. We store items that are property or useful to individuals experiencing homelessness for [ORGANIZATION] in a centralized location two blocks away from a [ORGANIZATION] station. Very good.",portland
05_22_2019,homeless,"I think that would really need to be an amendment to this ordinance to say that if this ordinance passes,  the review report for the expenditure that will be approved, we'll have a public comment period. So $5 million on a [ORGANIZATION] scope, $1 million for remediation, whatever, assistance in the homeless camp cleanup. One thing that pragmatically [ORGANIZATION], I think he's really diligent, I think he even made it to one of PERSON1 town halls out at ORG0 DATE1,  But here's the thing, once you budget that million dollars, how many times do you want to switch it off?",portland
05_22_2019,homeless,"Because we know that the homeless problem is extensive. Severe poverty, severe situations, a number of sites. So either you're going to have to allot it [ORGANIZATION], and homeless people will just be free after [LOCATION], because you'll have spent your [ORGANIZATION] allotment.",portland
05_22_2019,homeless,"or you'll have spent the million dollars in [ORGANIZATION] and the homeless people will be able to experience a reprieve. So I don't know if that specific language you're gonna ask for each of the individual RFP responders to address a million dollars for campsite cleanup  talked about in a silo where we're not talking about how we're going to have less homeless campers is not, I think, generating a lot of confidence by your constituents. Thank you.",portland
05_22_2019,homeless,"I agree with [ORGANIZATION]. Let's take that 25 million and put it into permanent supportive housing that has state licensed case management because unlike...  [ORGANIZATION], which says 40% of the people are disabled, it's 90%. Now, we realize you can't admit that because that would be admitting catastrophic failure to house people who are disabled, but when you have ORG1 contractors who cherry pick, you get the most disabled people on the [STREET].",portland
05_22_2019,homeless,"And, you know, nine beds added for behavioral health is like nothing. If you want to talk about the FAC0 building, never did you ask a disabled person for their input in how to make that work. I know, but I'm just saying $25 million to harass homeless people who are without housing because the state or the city or the county messed up in providing that housing is wrong.",portland
05_22_2019,homeless,"Are there any further questions of [ORGANIZATION]? I have two. So [ORGANIZATION], you just heard some testimony and I hear this testimony frequently that what your job is is to harass the homeless.",portland
05_22_2019,homelessness,A lot of them have experienced homelessness themselves. And so they take that living experience to inform their engagement with folks. I think it's been pretty helpful.,portland

05_22_2019,homelessness,"Because a lot of the trash produced by people experiencing homelessness is dirty or wet clothes. As with no [STREET] to wash or dry the clothes, it's easier to just dump them.

03_21_2018,housing crisis,"Colleagues, the multiple unit limited tax exemption or multi is a proven tool that we can use to get affordable units into the pipeline in the near term. We're in a housing crisis, as you're all aware, and the need is immediate. Not doing anything means that all of the units that are under consideration, that is the 10,000 units in the pipeline that are in the pipeline prior to the inclusionary housing ordinance coming into effect, all of those units will be market rate included.",portland
03_21_2018,housing crisis,in the absence of this multi-program being approved. Not doing anything means that we lose the opportunity to ensure that we are taking the housing crisis as seriously as possible. I've worked with my colleagues to find what we believe is the sweet spot on the cap on individual projects.,portland
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"So I'm concerned about the effect on affordable housing. It seems contrary to reason that we would build more market rate and how it would affect, but it obviously creates an environment where we can leverage affordable housing and the competition works to [STREET] down prices at some point. With that said...",portland
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor. As Commissioner [PERSON] just said, I know we all are concerned about the ongoing provision of housing in general and affordable housing. I have some questions about this particular proposal.",portland
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"We heard some sobering statistics [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] presented at budget time, and Madam Director, you'll correct me if I get this wrong, but –  we've identified that there's at least 24,000 units of deeply affordable housing that were short in the marketplace. And we're also seeing a lot of so-called luxury housing coming online that's out of the reach of middle-income working families and the poor. So when there's a market mismatch, it seems to me it is –  incumbent on government to act to remedy that, and the market is not working great for lower-income people.",portland
03_21_2018,housing crisis,"So it is our job to take some action. As my colleagues know, I am very focused on people of very modest means, because I think if we had a dollar to spend, I would always prefer to create a subsidy for someone who's really struggling on the margins. But the truth is our housing crisis is affecting people throughout the spectrum.",portland
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"I mean, I don't want to make a claim that's not entirely true, but we're roughly giving an abatement. We're giving an abatement that's roughly equivalent to what we might invest in affordable housing, which is about $100,000 a unit. However, we'd expect a much longer affordability period than [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_21_2018,housing crisis,"So I think this is a very good addition to our portfolio of affordability. This will not solve the housing crisis, nor has anybody proposed that it would. But from my perspective, if we want affordability built now,  the best [STREET] to look at is at all those projects that are going through the permitting process, that are going through their pre-development phase, that are ready to actually be built and have some of those units, which could come on [ORGANIZATION], be affordable, as opposed to when we work through new housing projects.",portland
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"So we're just clarifying within the code that the fees that will be charged are going to be part of an [ORGANIZATION] fee. This allows us also to look at ways in which we can have one rate for market rate dwellings and one for affordable rate. With [ORGANIZATION] adopting a new low-income fare, this might provide an opportunity to achieve both our transit goals and also our affordable housing goals.",portland
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"So this package is trying to marry those two things as well. So we're taking the new codes, which didn't include inclusionary housing. They included some different forms of bonuses and incentives for affordable housing and marry them to the inclusionary housing package so that it all works well together in the long run moving forward.",portland
03_21_2018,affordable housing,"And that's related to the map refinement project, which you heard about [ORGANIZATION]. In the new commercial mixed-use zones chapter, we are amending, again, the affordable housing bonus that exists now to be consistent with the [ORGANIZATION] approach.

I actually walked by [ORGANIZATION].",portland
04_20_2016,homeless,"I'd like to move to [ORGANIZATION] and maybe be a lobbyist.

[LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], FAC0, and ORG6 insist that ORG7 do the right thing.  begin the process of creating up to 300 affordable housing units, as agreed to by the city and [PERSON], by rezoning three blocks of [PERSON]'s property at the southeast corner of their campus from [ORGANIZATION] to FAC1. It's past the time to heal from the institutional racist violence endured [ORGANIZATION] by hundreds of people.",portland
04_20_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And on [ORGANIZATION], we were asked by [ORGANIZATION] to have ORG2 and the City of [ORGANIZATION] develop a local action plan. Also, since – which really, because of the makeup and the direction of the steering committee on the [ORGANIZATION] project, that local action plan, which you'll see in the near future, is focused on economic development and affordable housing development because of the concern, especially in that corridor, for displacement because that's the communities that are there. Secondly, since that – we approved that [ORGANIZATION] concept plan, we've all become virtually aware of the housing crisis.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And when you think of the level of funding regionally that we're going to need to raise to build this project, it seems that we would probably expect that we would have a housing component that would be part of that regional look at funding. So as we go into the next phase, which we greatly support with [ORGANIZATION] planning, at least we'll start to try to move forward our thinking on an affordable housing component. You're looking at me.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,so i heard your support for this and to join in leveraging the contributions that have come from [ORGANIZATION] GPE1 GPE2 metro [PERSON] and [PERSON] and with that happy to answer any questions thank you thank you i think we have some questions uh [ORGANIZATION] i appreciate this presentation i'm very excited about the prospects of high capacity transit in the barber corridor as as you know uh i guess i want to just drill down a little bit on  what we're talking about being more intentional about making sure affordable housing is constructed in this new corridor,portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,so i'm trying that typically when you build lines you you do purchase lots of property and i guess i'm curious how we're going to integrate  properties you acquire with redevelopment potential for affordable housing? And is affordable housing development a strategy that is discussed in the draft environmental impact statement?,portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"I agree with that. And an example of our past strategy, which I would contend we need to grow, maybe put on steroids if you will, is that we have  acquired opportunity parcels for construction staging and then have turned those parcels over into opportunities for uh for housing development when we started flight rail construction that was largely to demonstrate transitory into development well candidly we don't need to do that now the the goal of these same sorts of strategies will be affordable housing  And I can give you two examples along the current alignments where we're working to do that right now.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"There are many more, but one is up at our site at FAC0, just sort of kitty corner from FAC1 in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood.

And, again, that's a partnership with the city agencies as well as ORG2 writing down property in order to achieve that outcome.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"redeveloping property it's purchased, including for affordable housing. So affordable housing strategy and relative impacts of options will be looked at in the draft environmental impact statement. Commissioner, if I can just add to that.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And I'm going to direct this question to [ORGANIZATION] because I have no doubt that people of goodwill can be opportunistic in looking for options along the route. But I think what this council is likely to say is we want to actually have hard numbers, goals, and we want to make sure all of our tools are put to the service of accomplishing those goals. [ORGANIZATION], in addition to tag-teaming with [PERSON] and being the champions for affordable housing at [ORGANIZATION], you're a former planning director.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"Right. And so what we'll be looking for is some guidance as to what conditions we can put on our funding component of this project, because obviously the council is very supportive of this project, that ensures that we meet measurable goals on affordable housing, not just good intentions. Any feedback?",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And I know that Commissioner [PERSON] is leading that effort to take the –  inclusionary zoning opportunity, and the ability to adopt a construction excise tax to help fund some of those incentives and otherwise provide for affordable housing. In the sessions, actions [ORGANIZATION], the legislature neglected or failed to include [ORGANIZATION] among the governmental levels that can exercise that policy. excise tax.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"The partnership, let's take the model, though, of urban renewal, where we've had some hits and some misses. We have been at least intentional about setting the aspirational goals. And can we take the same thinking to this project where we look at the length and breadth of the line and we set some goals for the mix of housing, the number of houses that are affordable, and then look to see how through prescriptive measures like perhaps [ORGANIZATION] deciding that no land that it owns will be developed without an inclusionary housing component or something.  or first choice going to affordable housing development the [STREET] you've done on [ORGANIZATION] a couple of occasions to great success or those kinds of things.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"so it's good to know that uh and having rid uh ridden whatever the bus uh down barber uh obviously there's room for uh work here i also want to thank commissioner PERSON0 for uh asking if the eis is scoped  to include housing and affordable housing. After having the public comment earlier where we learned about some of the failures in our community to do the right thing in partnership with [ORGANIZATION], it would be great if we can, not just on this project but on all projects, try and pressure for state and federal issues that include scoping for affordable housing issues.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"But I'm more interested in the development and have been over [ORGANIZATION] working with [ORGANIZATION] and all the local jurisdictions in planning for the line because of the concern I have for an equitable community, including affordable housing for folks that live and work in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and  having participated in a number of probably half a dozen different groups, including [ORGANIZATION] ID Southwest with Commissioner [PERSON] and others, the [ORGANIZATION] Planning Housing Land Use Groups, [PERSON], [PERSON], and [LOCATION]. having co-chaired [ORGANIZATION] during this really exciting period, I want to commend staff at all the jurisdictions who've been so actively involved. We never had a negative response when we asked, which was constantly for folks to come out and give us updates.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"So it's been, I think, a good amount of stakeholder outreach, and that'll need to continue. So not to repeat what you have already asked of [ORGANIZATION] and what other folks have asked you for,  We just hope that as you go through the environmental impact statement process and really start on this line, that affordable housing, we do set really tangible targets. I don't think 30% to 50% would be out of line, just as it is in [ORGANIZATION] districts.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And I hope that we can, in [ORGANIZATION], have some of the jurisdictions follow suit  As usual, you may be taking the lead and pushing some of those new tools into practice, and we really appreciate that. So just to reiterate, a lot of new tools will need to come to bear, and we look forward to working with you in a variety of ways as community stakeholders and as affordable housing developers. [ORGANIZATION] couldn't be here from [ORGANIZATION], but I think she would have echoed the same comments.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. One of the concerns I always have on some of these large transportation projects when we're getting to the billions of dollars is that I want to have more of an emphasis, and I think I do commend Commissioner [PERSON], again, for emphasizing affordable housing, utilizing inclusionary zoning. But one of the things I think we really miss on some of these larger projects is that we have to have an understanding that,  Using an example of [ORGANIZATION] that they have a tremendous amount of employees that are working downtown",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And when we provide this type of infrastructure We have to stress to some of these larger corporations that there is a responsibility For you to develop workforce housing. It's one thing to create jobs It's another thing to utilize the current housing market out there for your employees and  But it's another thing to start planning in the future and understanding that if you don't start investing in the affordable housing, we're going to have some very serious problems on being able to provide housing for the overall market.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And when these opportunities are presented, now is the time for these larger corporations to step up and understand that these are great opportunities also –  to invest along these type of transportation lines and systems here. And understand that when you're building more workforce housing, affordable housing, that also takes the real stress away from the city of [ORGANIZATION] on trying to provide housing within the overall market. So now is the time to step up and understand that we can't continue to go in the same direction",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And we need your assistance to step up and start investing in these type of projects in affordable housing along these systems. Thank you. Thank you, [ORGANIZATION].",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], would you please call the roll? Substitute? Well, I appreciate the opportunity to revisit [ORGANIZATION], and it's really exciting, as I said, and I hope that we all marshal our forces together, the city and metro and [ORGANIZATION] and the other cities that are participating in this group to really seize this opportunity to integrate affordable housing opportunities at the outset and to make it more intentional.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"For those who worry that we somehow don't represent the entire city of [ORGANIZATION], I need to note that this is the last one, that I have allocated $36 million to East [ORGANIZATION] ORG0 since I've been [ORGANIZATION], a fraction of that in [ORGANIZATION],  and elsewhere around the city too. So I personally believe that the commission form of government makes us all responsible for a wide range of decisions, and that's a good thing for our community. I also appreciate the concerns that have been raised about affordable housing.",portland
04_20_2016,affordable housing,"And a market failure is whenever – is a time that the city needs to intervene.

05_17_2017,houseless,"I feel that the houseless community is completely discriminated against with the Rose Festival, especially blatantly regarding the rights that Rose Festival has to camp in the streets, to get tents, the stores help them out, everybody gets to crash on the streets, no cops, you know, this whole thing. And it's a blatant  disregard to how houseless people actually live and get swept off the streets while the Rose Festival people enjoying themselves get to hang out on the streets in tents. So that's one issue, but my main issue is [ORGANIZATION], and there will be protests.",portland
05_17_2017,homeless,"I don't know if that's the community village. The staffer mentioned a community village. But right now, while we have homeless people sleeping underneath FAC0 and those access ramps for FAC0, there's no porta potty there.",portland
05_17_2017,houseless,"Okay. And the reason I ask that is because I'm concerned that $400,000 can be put into an allowance for retaining architecture consultants and other subcontractors and subconsultants and all these things. but yet, I mean, that's extraordinarily higher than we've even allocated or approved or come to an agreement on as far as the houseless budget.",portland
05_17_2017,houseless,"And I know that during this project, the houseless community is going to be affected. So I'm wondering how that is going to be, how can you justify this kind of a budget to,  keep these people on retainer when we may not even use them. And yet it's such a struggle to get any money for the houseless or any projects going for the houseless that's sustainable and long-term, making the streets safer for our houseless, investing in tiny homes.",portland
05_17_2017,houseless,Whatever money is not utilized for this...  Let's talk about utilizing that leftover money for the houseless. Let's put that into a plan to utilize for the houseless. It goes into the spectator fund.,portland

05_17_2017,homeless,"The results have been very good. As Commissioner [PERSON] said at the beginning of the discussion, there were a lot of questions about whether this would be a successful partnership, and the data I've received suggests it's very successful, that it works with some of the most chronically homeless people, connecting them with important services that they need. It connects people with potential behavioral health issues with service providers that  rather than sending them to jail.",portland

I've given testimony about affordable housing, and there's definitely things there for that.",portland

05_17_2017,homeless,Okay. The homeless problem. Part of the problem is you guys put it in the media that there's a homeless problem because there are people that really care.,portland
05_17_2017,homeless,"And that's the reason that I'm here instead of like [ORGANIZATION] where they asked me to, why don't you come with our homeless rights group and speak to the city? Because I don't know what y'all have done over [ORGANIZATION], but the city is not trying to hear. But here in [PERSON] and the climate and the deal, there are public lands everywhere.",portland

05_17_2017,homeless,"We rely on volunteers in [ORGANIZATION], so we need to continue to support them as we need to.  25 million plus for [ORGANIZATION], that's a lot of money. When people come and say that they were not doing anything, I just keep thinking, well, 25 million is a lot of money, particularly in conjunction with the tripling of ORG2 budget over the time that I've been on the council. Okay.",portland
05_17_2017,homelessness,"I'm sure you have enough time. I believe it's to our credit as a council and a sign that we have clear priorities that this budget was passed with little fanfare and even less controversy.

People are sometimes impacted by homelessness during the course of services and they're able to complete their training and move into employment more effectively while housed.",portland
05_17_2017,homeless,"The [ORGANIZATION] community-based providers use their knowledge and expertise to serve specific populations with one-on-one individualized career coaching and occupational training in the community. Of course, much of the training is provided through a strong connection to ORG1 resources, which include training scholarships, paid work experiences, and placement support for career track jobs. The populations that we're referring to are homeless and housing insecure residents, 26% of our program in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_17_2017,homeless,"For the 400 formerly chronically homeless folks that were served by [ORGANIZATION], their average is $11.30, which is –  a real accomplishment for that population to connect with work and to get onto the path. For the 60 immigrants in [ORGANIZATION], that average wage was $16.84. So really digging into the details of which populations have which results is part of what this program does.",portland
05_17_2017,homeless,"That extension helps us to focus on homeless and housing insecure populations, and also it added [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to the existing strong network of providers, which increased the culturally specific approaches to work with those communities of color who were in this program and seeking services and support. So I'd like to...  say the person. Our testimony that we're introducing in writing would have been presented by [ORGANIZATION], who is the director of ORG2 at ORG3.",portland

What I am, and on the youth side for the most part, and I think you guys are pretty much aware of our work on the youth side here,  But what I'm really excited about, we have had an opportunity through this process to address homelessness with some of our young adults and some of our families as a result of this work. And it's been huge.",portland
05_17_2017,homelessness,"And we look forward to working with this particular project around homelessness moving forward because there are so many of our students and families that are dealing with this issue.

05_17_2017,homeless,"And when we took the housing money out of [ORGANIZATION] and created a new [ORGANIZATION],  It was at that time that then-Mayor [PERSON] made the decision to put the programs in [ORGANIZATION] and try to harness the power of the economic development side of the ledger. And I had the same misgivings about doing that that I later had when we proposed taking some of the homeless services out of ORG2 and migrating them to the county. And it wasn't because I was...  reluctant to consider ways of better aligning or streamlining or delivering services.",portland
04_17_2019,houseless,"Is that journalistic bombast or speaking truth to power? If a white mayor tells an unnamed elected official it's disrespectful, if a landlord representative is reduced to tears due to unduly harsh treatment by tenant rights organizers and pro-tenant politicians, is that disrespectful? Are houseless folks camped out in tents and tarps on sidewalks by the hundreds or even thousands, are they being disrespected by landlord real estate moguls, whether these landlord reps are crying or not?  Several [ORGANIZATION] cities have declared [ORGANIZATION]-long housing emergencies.",portland

With the approval of this [ORGANIZATION], we will be able to start projects that will help with the connectivity of the streets to keep the community safe. Without the approval of this [ORGANIZATION], the neighborhood will not have a chance to be developed, we will not be able to build high density affordable housing, we will not be able to help small businesses and not be able to employ hundreds of people.",portland

06_01_2016,affordable housing,"I know because that's where I lived. And there were simply too many taxpayer-funded monologues by the likes of [ORGANIZATION] about affordable housing and it put of the locals, churches full of the elderly and black residents who in fact...  did not want these demolitions and these shoddy new constructions that cost $3,000 a month.

06_01_2016,homeless,"And it's equally illegal and difficult to you.

06_01_2016,homeless,"I know there's some hope that we can have everybody [ORGANIZATION] next to or not immediately next to but near and with indoor plumbing sometime within [ORGANIZATION], but When we're talking about bathrooms, we need to face the reality that we're still doling out potties as a privilege and  If you have a life where you can go home to a bathroom, we can lock up the public bathrooms at [TIME]. The loo, of course, there are the three loos to service 3,000 homeless people. And so in addition to the political correctness, and as [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, I know that the mayor mentioned whichever state passed its ridiculous discrimination law so we couldn't go visit the USS Portland when it was in [ORGANIZATION], right?",portland

04_04_2018,affordable housing,So I think we have to be really careful when we talk about what we're addressing and not just dismiss affordable housing as not helping the people that are on the [STREET] right now. We have to also be thinking about the people that...  could end up on the [STREET] DATE0 or [LOCATION] because we don't have any safety net to catch those people and help those people. And so I just want to say anything I see with affordable housing does not make me angry.,portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"Right. And when I use the term affordable housing, I'm talking about people who have either no assets and resources or up to about 60%. But, again, I think it is important that we ask the question affordable to whom.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"It's uniquely what our role is, and that's what I think we generally mean when we talk about affordable housing.  Exactly. Thank you for that. I appreciate it.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And then he never gets to hear the thoughtful conversation again.  that he actually helped create. And that's just too bad. I use the words affordable housing to mean any number of things, but they all mean one thing in common, and that is below market rate.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And during my campaign, I knew that people were confused by the term affordable housing, so I started saying workforce and low-income and very low-income housing. And then hilariously, the conversation came back to, well, what do you mean? Which takes us right back to the [ORGANIZATION] definition of affordability, 80% [ORGANIZATION], 60% [ORGANIZATION], 0 to 30% [ORGANIZATION].",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"What we mean when we are talking about affordable housing for these particular ordinances is to do a study and look at the range of options all the [STREET] from zero up to 80% [ORGANIZATION]. and when proposals finally come before this board, we will be talking about very specific levels of affordability and for whom. And if people stick around for [TIME], we're going to hear from [ORGANIZATION], and we're going to be very specific.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"about affordability and homeownership and the challenges that are there, particularly for our black community, but that are generally applicable to the entire community. So I don't want us to get too bogged down on what we mean when we're talking about affordable housing, except to say at various levels of affordability for various people at this point. This is a study.",portland
04_04_2018,housing crisis,"After finishing the book, I came away with outrage towards our past leaders, not just in [ORGANIZATION] but throughout the country, that caused and continue to perpetuate the most heinous of housing inequities. The [ORGANIZATION] housing crisis has a number of serious issues, but in my mind, there is one tragedy that stands above them all, housing for people of color. There are several things that I became aware of from reading this book.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], cities across the nation increased minimum lot sizes to make affordable housing impossible. Also sounds very familiar. On page 238 of this book, the following quote, What's important is that until we arouse in Americans the understanding of how we created a system of unconstitutional, state-sponsored, de jure segregation and a sense of outrage about it, neither remedies nor reparations will be on the public agenda.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"The color of law also debunks the theory that all housing is good housing. Oversupplying cities with market rate and luxury apartments continues to create even more segregated communities. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] Commissioner [PERSON] dedicated an additional $20 million to affordable housing to begin to address the ongoing threat of displacement and gentrification.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"So this is really ripe for some good affordable housing, plus other things that are desired by the community of [ORGANIZATION]. So I'm very happy to accept this grant. Aye.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"I'd like to thank [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], and I'm pleased to see the chair here [TIME] speaking in support of these proposals and all the other folks in the community who have worked hard to bring this to this stage [ORGANIZATION]. I'd also like to thank ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and others for their support of the, and I'm going to use the term, affordable housing program. in faith communities grant because that is the name of the grant.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"I know, me too. Well, similarly to [ORGANIZATION], it's –  heartening to see landowners, whether they're communities of faith or private landowners, being so intentional about how their property can be used to kind of its fullest potential, including serving existing communities and providing affordable housing. So this is really, really exciting.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"In our rental projects, we again want to make sure we're communicating timelines and opportunities so that folks are understanding when they will be able to access these possible opportunities. But we also have concerns about changes to some projects that seem to be in the pipeline, for example, around reducing bedroom size to zero and one bedrooms. We are building affordable housing for the very long term here.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"It's not a good idea  infrastructure for health and resilience. I don't believe in a community. So I think just to be very clear in our conversations about this larger affordable housing topic, which we've been talking about [TIME], that this work in a gentrified neighborhood is vital.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And it is highly misleading to the public because people and even the press, to some degree, interpret this as a commentary on our views around affordable housing. And the reality is that has nothing to do with this conversation. This is an appeal from a design review hearing, and we are acting as the appeal board for a design review process.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"In other words, we would apply the same bonus system that currently exists everywhere else downtown other than the historic district. And the bonus would operate with our existing rules, which in this case would say –  that you get the extra height if you deliver desperately needed affordable housing. So I offer that amendment.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And so that proposal...  as you said, is consistent with the [STREET] we've increased height through the FAC0 project. When we've increased height across the central city, it's been through our bonus height system, and that is in an effort to ensure there's a public benefit associated with that increased height. So your amendment is increasing from 125 to 160 on the western side of the block using the bonus height system  as well as the bonus that they would be required to use would be the affordable housing bonus.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"So there's an extra level, we have a very small number of bonuses. There's the affordable housing bonus, but there's also the option of transferring FAR from a historic resource. In this particular case, this would ensure that they would be using the affordable housing bonus to obtain that bonus height.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And they would not be able to use the historic resource bonus? The [STREET] that this has been proposed, no. They would be required to go to the affordable housing bonus first.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"Well, if they needed more FAR, that would just be a secondary bonus or transfer that they could go to. For this particular case, to obtain that bonus height up to the 160, the proposal just says you need to go to the affordable housing bonus first. And they could go to the historic resource transfer after that?",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"That's actually a very helpful context for me. Sorry to be absorbing this on the fly, but it's important nuance for me to understand. So fundamentally –  From that perspective, given the important role of [ORGANIZATION], the work we're doing here, 160 versus 200, with different FAR and affordable housing requirements, which are effectively parallel, I don't see how it impacts the historic district one [STREET] or the other.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"So we have the two choices before us. My amendment ensures that...  that this additional height and the benefit we're giving an owner is treated just as we would treat any other development within the downtown outside of a historic district. It would be subject to a bonus system, and we would have the benefit of some affordable housing.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"I just want to make sure I'm clear, because Commissioner [PERSON], excuse me, [PERSON], I have increased height to 160 through the bonus height and then require the owner to use affordable housing. Okay, so for purposes of keeping this clean, I would offer my amendment as simply requiring that any height above 125 feet be subject to the housing bonus. Okay.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"Before we vote. Thank you, Mayor. So to me, what sways me and justifies in my mind the additional height increase from 125 to 200 is the substantial additional yield of affordable housing units.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"But the delta, the number of increased affordable housing units from, I think, 160 to 200 is about 40 additional units. And then the total number of apartments, I believe, under the 200 feet is 342 apartments total.  versus 199. And that was all public testimony that was given [ORGANIZATION] by, I believe, an architect working with the developer.",portland
04_04_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And I found those numbers to be substantial. And I think, you know, in a time of a housing crisis, we need to be doing all we can to accommodate more affordable housing, and I think this is one [STREET] to do that. But I was also, I have to say quite honestly, I was struck when I – it was [ORGANIZATION] I was driving with my partner to go to dinner –  someplace actually on the east side of the river, but we were going down FAC0 and LOC0.",portland
04_04_2018,affordable housing,"And I think that's the reality we have to square ourselves with here, is this old town, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has become a ghost town, and we've got to do something to catalyze development here. I think this project does that. and it produces more affordable housing to boot at 200 feet.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"We dare not let that neighborhood be degraded while other communities don't have streets and sidewalks in our town. Thank you. Recently, we had the pleasure of having 40% of y'all, well, actually half of the people who are sitting in front of me, came over to the county commission building at the invitation of [ORGANIZATION], part of their hopefully successful strategy to keep their pool, despite the belief that we need a 5% across-the-board reduction so that we can improve the lives of some of our homeless citizens.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"And we know we've helped so many homeless veterans, and I know that's on your agenda to try and help find homes, and we're trying to give tools to  to veterans. So any help we could get to partner with us, that would be great. We partner with  [ORGANIZATION] and several employment organizations in the state of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"Typically, as you well know, we handle budget allocation requests either through the budget process, through our fall and [ORGANIZATION] bump. And  In congruence with the state of emergency, we're here [LOCATION] to go outside of that norm because there is a need on the [STREET] currently that is not being met that's causing considerable backlog and actually resulting in more people in danger of falling into homelessness at a time when we're trying to get them out of homelessness. So the package that we're bringing here [LOCATION] is a request for unallocated general fund  outside of the budget process to both pay back costs that have been  by [ORGANIZATION] as we've been moving forward on shelter and other programs, and then a request for additional funding, all of which will be spent in [DATE].",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"Obviously, in the budget process, we'll be making decisions to bring forward to the mayor and council on funding for [ORGANIZATION]. This is all for [LOCATION]. remainder of [ORGANIZATION] to keep us moving as we're attacking the issues surrounding homelessness.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"The next portion is the property broker, as again, we're working with the mayor's office in identifying and housing and identifying properties for shelters. We had our broker service, which we used to find and identify properties that we enlisted first on this project.  and determine that just the sheer number of properties that come in, not from everybody who's involved in this process as well as the community. We needed to have a staff person who could actually be on the ground going out investigating properties and seeing whether or not these properties have a possible purpose for a shelter or for some other long-term purposes in the housing and homeless issues.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"And then finally on our list is the [ORGANIZATION] storage pilot. So the [ORGANIZATION] storage, as you probably heard, opened up [ORGANIZATION] at the [ORGANIZATION] campsite as well as the FAC0 location over on the west side of the FAC0. The camp [ORGANIZATION] storage, again, is...  something that we're piloting to see and address the needs of the homeless.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"Currently, homeless people on the [STREET] have nowhere to store their belongings so that they can seek services throughout [ORGANIZATION] or employment or whatever else it might be. The day storage is being piloted at two locations. One is a non-organized camp.",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"All of those folks are looking for permanent housing. At the same time, the continued rental crisis and escalating rents and stagnating incomes are pushing thousands of additional individuals and families to the edge of homelessness [ORGANIZATION]. Our providers are reporting receiving hundreds of calls for eviction prevention help [PERSON] that they have to turn away.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"So short-term rent assistance, it's very flexible funding that allows a nonprofit agency that is working with someone who is currently homeless to pay first and [ORGANIZATION] rent, application fees, past debt, things that are financial barriers to that family getting into housing. It also allows providers to work with families that have currently a housing situation that they could stay in, but for whatever reason they haven't been able to pay the rent. And it allows us to provide rental assistance maybe for [LOCATION], maybe two, maybe DATE2.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"That's right. Who didn't become homeless because we gave them a little bit of help. Exactly, exactly.",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION], I'm remembering over [ORGANIZATION] the conversation we've had about short-term rental assistance, which we call straw, and that at almost every time this conversation has come up and we've asked [ORGANIZATION] or our partners if we had one extra dollar to spend, where would we spend it? I think the consensus has been it's our most flexible and our most effective dollar. Because it gets people off the [STREET] quickly, gets them into existing shelter, and in some instances prevents people from falling into homelessness.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"And I think the scenario that drives us all crazy is the person that's $100 short on making a rent payment that leads to an eviction, that leads to a parade of horribles with that family that's all preventable if we can keep them in their home. That's right. I've got sort of a side question, which is, do we know what percentage of the homeless population are people who had a home and the rent went up and they couldn't afford the rent increase?",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"I don't off the top of my head. I think we've surveyed in the past sort of primary cause of someone's homelessness. I mean, ultimately, everyone who's out there had a home at some point and for whatever reason is no longer there.",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"How many of those?  that the most proximate cause was the rent increase. I don't know the answer to that. What we're hearing from the family system is that about a third of the families that are in the new family shelter have not experienced homelessness before, and that is principally being driven by market conditions in the rental market.",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"I mean, I think that would be really useful to have because if rents continue to go up and if that's a major cause of homelessness, then we are going to be dealing with a rising level of homelessness unless we can come up with a hell of a lot of money for rent assistance. Yes. And the challenge of affording the rent was the primary cause was a disability or some other one that –  continued rise in rent levels is definitely preventing folks from ending their homelessness and is a driver.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,I'm PERSON0. I'm [PERSON] Manager for [ORGANIZATION]. and i want to talk about three additional programs for which we're seeking startup funds um with this um with what we're bringing you [TIME] uh one is a tenant protection team,portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"Secondly, transportation for people experiencing homelessness who are stranded here and maybe they came here for a job possibility or for family or friends that were here, but they  They need assistance in getting back to where they have a support system, where there's a [STREET] where they might be able to stay permanently. [ORGANIZATION] has had a similar program since [ORGANIZATION] called [ORGANIZATION], where they pay transportation assistance so that people can get back to where they have a support network, so they're not stranded in that city. So it's something that we're looking to start up.",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"Because I very strongly believe that the governing structure for all of our work in addressing homelessness needs to be the home for everyone. And specifically, [ORGANIZATION] needs to be the lead agency. And while I have enormous respect for you, [ORGANIZATION], and for [PERSON] and your efforts, what I want to avoid going forward is what to some may be viewed as a series of workarounds.",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION]'s shop, whether she's located on this side of the river or the other side of the river, is the top ending homelessness resource in the state of [ORGANIZATION]. I can say that without fear of contradiction. And I just want to make sure that we're aligned and we're not just sort of adding new players and new bureaus and new folks, well-intentioned, but outside of the leadership structure that we've worked so hard to create.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless; homelessness,"I'm delighted you're going to do that. And the lead agency is code language for whether we – a proposal to essentially co-locate the ending homeless team  on the other side of the river, and to marry it with the county's parallel effort to end homelessness and to sort of continue the work that we started with [ORGANIZATION] of looking for better alignment. And that's a work in progress.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"And again, we take no money from you guys. I'm sad that there's not representatives from the homeless here [ORGANIZATION]. I'm not sure they understood the significance of what's going on here.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"And I'm very uncomfortable speaking for the homeless, because I'm not homeless, so I don't feel it. I don't know what it is, [TIME], to be really freezing. I've never had that experience.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"I've always been able to go into a warm [STREET] like you, take a hot shower, have some coffee. It's not that you're spending not enough money,  I would suggest you're not spending the money correctly. And we ask you over and over again that you have homeless representatives on your committees because they're the ones that know.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,This is a tough question. And I would suggest to you that you might want to consider taking the whole homeless question and separate it from housing. Separate it from the shelters.,portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"So try something new. Take the homeless, whatever the numbers are. I can't believe the numbers people throw around.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"And we have still some cracks that I believe that need to be patched in the very hard and productive work that [ORGANIZATION] and his team are doing. If we really believed we had a homeless state of emergency, we would be  if not compelling, effectively partnering with Judge [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]. And there would be a list telling us exactly how many people are evicted [ORGANIZATION] and making sure those people get connections with essential services.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"But, you know, in addition to the actual service work, it is legitimate to budget for agitation and coordination until we can build a more responsive thing. One thing I hope there will be time to look at is  What does the city of [ORGANIZATION] do? It has [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_16_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Commissioner [PERSON] isn't here at all [ORGANIZATION], but Commissioner [PERSON], I was, feels like maybe when you didn't vote for the R2D2 and some of the comments you make, it makes me think that looking back when you were housing commissioner and I came here at first as a homeless person [PERSON], how nothing ever got done. And it was such a disappointment after all the work that [ORGANIZATION] had done,  PERSON3 before him, but [ORGANIZATION] and all the plans we had for the [ORGANIZATION] end of homelessness.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"When I was homeless more recently, somebody introduced me to the dumpster outside the nines and we were wearing the $9 million slippers that people just throw away when they leave this fancy hotel that gutted out [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. They got a waiver on their loan. But the people who are now suffering under this emergency, as soon as you announce there was going to be a moratorium on increases, just like when under PERSON2, under the [ORGANIZATION] economic collapse, when there was an announcement that they were going to get tight on credit cards, suddenly people's credit cards went up.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"I do appreciate that if we didn't spend this money right now, it could indeed fall to ending fund balance, and that would be an additional $1.4 million for capital maintenance projects, which, as Commissioner [PERSON] pointed out [ORGANIZATION], we do need to be continuing to invest in safety on our streets, with 37 people having died DATE1 on our streets in violent traffic accidents. And there are people dying on our streets from being lack of shelter. We have a homeless and housing affordability emergency.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"It is a tragedy that people are outside. And I really appreciate the team's work on this. As Ms. [PERSON] just noted so cogently,  Giving people rent assistance in particular, stopping people from becoming homeless, is by far the most cost effective, and there's a good chunk of change in this ordinance for that and for other necessary things.",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"First, I want to just acknowledge we haven't had [ORGANIZATION] in our chambers in a while. I know she's been out for a while, but [ORGANIZATION] Erickson and her team that work on –  long-term, cost-effective solutions to ending homelessness have been leading the [STREET] for a long time. And [ORGANIZATION], thanks to you and your team.",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"And for those who somehow think that [ORGANIZATION] is this isolated sort of [STREET] over here that has a unique situation with homelessness, I invite you to go to [PERSON] where they're under a [STREET] order to provide emergency shelter for 60,000 people a night. I invite you to go to GPE2 where a federal judge recently declared there were 50,000 unsheltered people and growing. I invite you to watch the debates for the President of GPE3, and two things you'll notice.",portland
03_16_2016,homeless,"i very much appreciate what commissioner [ORGANIZATION] just said also appreciate what commissioner [PERSON] said about her usual reluctance to engage in budget decisions outside the budget process which i share but i also share her reasons for going along with making a budget decision outside the normal budget process in this case  I just wanted to briefly touch on one element of this proposal, which is funding for [DATE] storage facilities. I think that's important not just for people who are homeless but for the larger community because I think when we get calls from people who are upset about seeing homeless people on the streets and sidewalks, I think to a great extent what they're upset about is seeing a bunch of stuff lying around.",portland
03_16_2016,homelessness,"We are learning from other cities. We had the mayors of the [ORGANIZATION] cities here in [ORGANIZATION], and we spent [LOCATION], along with the Secretary of [ORGANIZATION] and the head of [ORGANIZATION], talking about what works and what doesn't work and how many more people we're each dealing with, as you mentioned, Commissioner [PERSON].

Yeah, and since you prompted it, I think one of the favorite quotes I had in our appointment for her was to wrestle good design out of modest budgets.",portland
05_20_2015,affordable housing,"All right. Roll call. Mayor, I've known [ORGANIZATION] for a long time, and I've seen some of her greatest work that she did with [ORGANIZATION], where in affordable housing development and design, she brought a...  a set of values to the table, a conviction that low-income people should be able to live in a space that's functional and beautiful, an attention to detail and to the bottom line, and ultimately to bringing very complex projects to fruition.",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"So again, I want to have an understanding on that other committee that you want to set up. MY UNDERSTANDING, YOU SAID 25 [ORGANIZATION]. I'D LIKE TO SEE THEIR [ORGANIZATION] AND I'D LIKE TO SEE ALL THE BIOS ON ALL THOSE PEOPLE TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING WHO YOU PLAN ON HAVING OVERLOOK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES IN THIS CITY, A 250 MILLION PLUS DOLLAR BOND TOWARD AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WHICH [ORGANIZATION], THE CITY WILL OWN THIS INVENTORY.",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you, [PERSON]. It's the affordable housing complex going up, down by FAC0 and FAC1. And, you know, I walk there, I see a lot of people kind of lounging around, and they walk with a different pep in their step.",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"It's an epidemic that nobody's paying attention to. Anytime you walk by an affordable housing unit, look at all that plywood in there. That's 5% to 8% toxic glue.",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"And thank you to [ORGANIZATION] voters for agreeing to dig deep to fund affordable housing. This is a stellar group of people that we are appointing [ORGANIZATION]. And just looking at the range of qualifications around business and equity, older adults, small business, East [ORGANIZATION], fair housing, advocacy, and nuts and bolts in expertise and development.",portland
04_05_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"I think this is a firstLOC2rate committee, and so I will simply say thank you to all of the individuals who have agreed to serve. And my nominee is [ORGANIZATION], who I think will bring a unique perspective, both as a person of color, As an [ORGANIZATION] advocate, as someone helping to lead a new business district in LOC1LOC2LOC3, and who is passionate about addressing the affordable housing crisis in our city.",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"So I think we could make that more of our routine again, that would be great. So I wish this committee well and this is an important trust we're giving to this committee to help guide this council in making wise investments with the affordable housing bond measure. PERSON0?",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,We're approving it. I could add a little bit of detail to that. This is a very important effort associated with the  future light rail line that is going to go and serve [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] south and west of that and I think this council has agreed at a very early point that we want to make sure we capture affordable housing opportunities Before the land gets too pricey.,portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"So this is what really what these efforts are about working with [ORGANIZATION] The city of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and others to really Try to land bank future affordable housing options in [ORGANIZATION] public testimony. I  Good morning. Good morning, Commissioner [PERSON], [PERSON].",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"There's really not a lot of affordable housing nonprofits that operate in [ORGANIZATION], so that's part of the issue is trying to find them. And I especially appreciate the clarity that the corridor is going to become an increasing use buzzword as we look at mass transit light rail moving into that area. Thank you very much.",portland
04_05_2017,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], okay. So we've tried to encourage [ORGANIZATION] to have no engagement with using county inmate work crews to [STREET] homeless people to other places. But let the staff person speak if there's anything that's come across in their paperwork that they know of any homeless camping situations here.",portland
04_05_2017,homeless,So I'm asking all these questions because just as we know we have hundreds of people living in cars and RVs. We also have an undetermined number of otherwise homeless people living on our river in vessels. And the mayor suggested [TIME] that we may look at creating a space for these RVs.,portland
04_05_2017,homeless,"And we have to understand is that what we don't see in this ordinance [ORGANIZATION] is that if that quote term homeless person on the boat  is actually determined to be homeless, then I'm asking for an exemption on them from being- I'm sorry to interrupt. Could I ask people who are speaking, could you please keep it down or take it outside so that we can hear? Thank you.",portland
04_05_2017,homeless,"And you do not see that here. Now, when you remove a tent or something on a sidewalk,  Although a bad how bad it is they still have a right technically to go down and try to reclaim that property now What you're doing is you're placing a two to three to five thousand dollar towing fee by your paperwork Which you know there is no homeless boater that can afford that amount of money so they have just lost their boat and I assume they've lost all their possessions and  Because you don't allow them to tie off on these landings which are public properties for [TIME] and again [ORGANIZATION] handles this for you and their position is just get them off the river just get them off the river tow their boat [PERSON] their boat take their possessions and that is their position.",portland
04_05_2017,homeless,"Okay, very good. Well, I think I've made my point, Mayor. And the reality is, be cautious and work with these people that have been determined that they are, quote, what [ORGANIZATION] calls homeless voters.",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"Which is why I think it's so important that we invest in a long term solution, which is a public bank where we have complete control and we can invest  in accordance with our city's values. I think that we need to decouple what is good for us financially from what maximizes Wall [STREET] profits, which is the investments that we're limited to right now. And if we were instead, instead of funding fossil fuel expansion, exploitive human rights abuses and corporate corruption, we should be using our investments to support local affordable housing, sustainable infrastructure and quality education.",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"Maybe here in [ORGANIZATION] we'd decide to focus on building up our affordable housing stock, reinvesting in our schools, or transitioning to sustainable energy or something else. But the point for me is that we should be investing in line with our values and the only [STREET] to do that long term is to control that through a municipal bank. Thank you.",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"It would be run by professional banks, not politicians, and it would be run for the benefit of the city and community. A municipal bank can decrease costs of working with large banks like [ORGANIZATION], saving taxpayers considerable sums on critical infrastructure costs like roads, parks, and affordable housing. Earnings from the bank from loans and interest could then go back into feeding the city coffers rather than the profit margins of Wall [STREET], as we were considering at the beginning of this meeting about our investment potential.",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,"So I'm not the most educated on the issue, but off the bat I find it somewhat contradictory. DATE0 we have a room full of people saying affordable housing, a process which companies like [ORGANIZATION] thrive off of, and then [LOCATION] we're saying don't support them. But the thing is their products lie on the shelf.",portland
04_05_2017,homeless,"And as the treasurer was saying, you know, $4.5 million-ish [ORGANIZATION], potentially more [ORGANIZATION], I did some quick math on my own. I'm not as fast as [ORGANIZATION] is. But 4.5 million, that's 285 new units of permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals in our community.",portland
04_05_2017,homeless,"That's 850 [ORGANIZATION] accessible curb ramps. That's 667 additional year round shelter beds based on current costs. And when I was elected, what people told me they wanted to do was  address affordability, address the homeless crisis, improve the policing structure in our community, and fill the dang potholes in front of my house.",portland
04_05_2017,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION]? I keep thinking of the affordable housing and the shelter beds and the [ORGANIZATION] accessible routes that the Mayor commented on. And I'm very worried about losing 3.5 million in a budget process that we're currently in.,portland
05_12_2016,affordable housing,"I just want to make a brief statement because this has turned out to be surprisingly contentious, and we've heard passionate voices on both sides. Housing advocates have weighed in and see it as a tool for  creating different affordable housing options. Many neighborhoods fear that it means demolishing houses and replacing them with row houses and changing the character of their neighborhoods.",portland
05_12_2016,housing crisis,"The truth is we're in a housing crisis, and we need more places for people to live and for those places to remain affordable. Without conscious design and forethought, we are at risk of creating deeper geographic divisions than we already have. Younger people, people of color, blue-collar workers, older adults, families with children, and people of modest means should not be essentially barred in or out of any neighborhood.",portland
05_12_2016,affordable housing,"And the truth is that throughout our community and in places like [ORGANIZATION], mobile home parks are some of the last affordable housing in our community. And there are tremendous opportunities for us to not only preserve this property,  unique housing stock, but also to help the existing tenants gain some kind of ownership in the mobile home park and to bring some of our other values to play, like green buildings, so that we replace aging, quasi-uninhabitable structures with long-term green and sustainable structures. The truth is, however, that we will not be successful without the city and the county prioritizing this issue.",portland
05_12_2016,affordable housing,"Well, this is exactly the type of discussion we're involved with right now, [ORGANIZATION] with FAC0 on Northeast FAC1 and FAC2. And precisely because the legislature is now allowing us to impose a construction excise tax, these are the types of investments that we hope to be able to preserve and to rehabilitate to make them good, solid, affordable housing. So I appreciate your language, Commissioner [PERSON].",portland
05_12_2016,homelessness,"I appreciate, Commissioner [PERSON], that – I mean, the other changes to this I support. Rest areas are currently not part of our official policy of how we address homelessness. And to put it in the comp plan as an amendment, I don't think it's appropriate.",portland
05_12_2016,affordable housing,"Aye. PERSON0. Well, I believe that off-[STREET] parking, I think we all know that is a major contributor to the increased cost of construction, therefore increasing cost of affordable housing.",portland
03_25_2015,houseless,"Where I am DATE0 is  with very humbly saying that I'm houseless. And as far as emotional regulation goes, I'm in counseling for complex PTSD with [ORGANIZATION] therapy in mind and trauma recovery exercises. And where I'm going is I'm hoping to reduce my hypervigilance and my inner critic to increase my self-compassion.",portland
03_25_2015,homeless,"It's...  should be used, it should be, could be used as an encampment for homeless people and take care of all the people that are living on the sidewalks and stuff like that. And when it isn't and there's that much land available, that makes me feel bad about my city, the city I live in. We appreciate you bringing that point.",portland
03_25_2015,homeless,"It was a transportation department, and they had the people moved off of it. Here is a [STREET] three.  blocks for all of the homeless people in [ORGANIZATION], and please don't turn that down. That's a wonderful opportunity.",portland
03_25_2015,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] was a part of an article [ORGANIZATION] about homelessness. He said he looked all over [ORGANIZATION], and he couldn't find a [STREET] to move the homeless people into. Well, that is right in our face.",portland
03_25_2015,homeless,"You see, it's right in front of us. It's right in the city of [ORGANIZATION] that all of these homeless people can be moved to. And I'm very sorry.",portland
03_25_2015,homeless,Almost all of the homeless. We hear your point. And I'll understand that that is until I'm explained different.,portland
03_25_2015,homeless,"Our criteria, I believe from the DATE0 ordinance, had a series of criteria that they wanted them all met. This time around, after some discussions, we sort of broadened that to include efficiencies, because when the [ORGANIZATION] customers heard saving money, I think they were equating that with protecting  potentially a budget cut that would come later and it was a little bit harder to assess where those savings might occur so last time around in [LOCATION] you heard from [ORGANIZATION] about a sharing information with the faith-based community and ORG1 and the tool that they wanted to implement would save a lot of time in data entry but it would save it  Some on the city side and also some on the nonprofit side. So the city is getting a better investment in helping their housing programs meet the homeless community needs.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"So now, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] will present how they've incorporated those amendments into the respective [ORGANIZATION] reports that are in front of us, and we will take testimony, because we're required to do so, on the amendments, only on the amendments, because we closed the hearing on the remainder of these reports. In [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner [PERSON]'s office, Commissioner [PERSON]'s office, and my office have discussed  continued to prepare a development solicitation for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] is preparing a resolution that reflects that work, and I think Commissioner [PERSON] would like to be here and has filed that resolution for consideration DATE2. So for all those reasons, because we're going to take testimony on the amendments [ORGANIZATION], because Commissioner [PERSON] wants to be here and he has a resolution to back up the ORG2's discussion and intent  on affordable housing in that district.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"And then the second update is actually, once again, a change to language in the report to [LOCATION] that refers to the desire for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. So I'll just quickly run through those so everybody has the same information, and then we can take testimony. Thank you.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Yeah, I've got, okay, [DATE], yes, thank you. Okay. And then the next one, this is the paragraph that appears in the page 26 of the report that relates to the update to [ORGANIZATION], your renewal plan, and it relates specifically to bringing affordable housing to [PERSON].",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Should [ORGANIZATION] dispose of its property in the area, it shall include a requirement for affordable housing or shall be included in a larger development site that will be developed as affordable housing. This requirement may be implemented through a covenant to the deed requiring affordable housing upon the sale or transfer of the city property. And this simply just allows for two different scenarios.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"One is that the development will occur on the [ORGANIZATION] site, and therefore we meet the requirement there. But it also accounts for what I think is a more likely scenario, which is that when the parcels, because it's not just the [ORGANIZATION] parcel, there's a ORG1 parcel, there's other parcels, when they –  are sold to private or other maybe not-for-profit development interests, depending on the scenario. It may be that projects cut across existing property lines, and we want to account for affordable housing being built in that triangle as opposed to making it required just within a kind of somewhat arbitrary boundary of the [ORGANIZATION] property.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, so we'll go reverse order. I'm PERSON0 of FAC0, thanking you for allowing some additional testimony [ORGANIZATION] on the amendments. [ORGANIZATION] obviously has a range of affordable housing currently and encourages that concept.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"but [ORGANIZATION] should not be the only [STREET] affordable housing is specified council should be enforcing its affordable housing close quotas in the pearl district and in all the uras  I'm also asking the council consider an additional amendment, which would be adding portions to [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] portions, LOC2 and FAC0. If you're serious about development against the FAC1 line, because there are many vacant lots there already, or adding south of FAC2, if you desire continuity of development on both sides of FAC2, And if you look at some of the acreages in question, southeast [PERSON] is roughly 36 acres, public and private, and has two of the light rail stations.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"The city should stay firm on its requirements as [ORGANIZATION] must commit to making land available for the bridge park and to greenway improvements in exchange for urban renewal dollars. Recently, a more complete summary of the Block 33 transactions between ORG1 and ORG2 became available. The $6 million committed to the now-abandoned Block 33 affordable housing development came from [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has been held up as a textbook example of urban renewal done right. In that case, [ORGANIZATION] were approved simultaneously. All of the planned parks and most of the affordable housing have been successfully developed.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"This [ORGANIZATION] should take a page from that experience and make adoption of [ORGANIZATION] contingent upon agreements with [PERSON] and ORG2 for parks and affordable housing sites. Short of that, will you commit to the public that, as the city negotiates development agreements, these items will be required in exchange for the millions of dollars that will be invested in the district to the benefit of these property owners? Thank you.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"I can't speak for the board as a whole, but I can say that I've had multiple conversations recently with board members and with other residents within the neighborhood who express concern about the land use. The loss of affordable housing in our neighborhood, it seems to be really popular, and we're seeing $700,000 homes. So we would very much support an opportunity to regain some of that affordable housing.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Obviously, there are many advantages to affordable housing in a [STREET] that is at the nexus of multiple modes of transit and transportation. One of the often stated at one time disadvantages is the presence of heavy rail right along the district, but some of the noise has been recently resolved with a quiet zone. Our neighbors are happy about that.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"There is a concern about, I've heard recently about, what does affordable housing mean? Does it really mean those people with [ADDRESS] up within their careers and I would hope that this intent is intended for the latter from my experience on the urban renewal area advisory committees that's my understanding  We actually have the option for a park or an open space in that area that I mentioned during my last meeting with you from the money that came to [ORGANIZATION] from the sale of property back to ORG1. I would say that we, many of us within hand, we want to see something that is mixed income housing, not just...  low affordable or low income housing because we think it's a better, it's better for everybody concerned.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you. And I think that's everything I wanted to say. Could I just clarify from Commissioner [PERSON], I know that Commissioner [PERSON] has also been working on this, but the intent is affordable housing at 60 percent and less.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,It wouldn't preclude by any means mixed income. But it doesn't mean that we're providing affordable housing necessarily for someone who's a recent college graduate and then going to be moving up. It might very well be 60%.,portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,It may at that time. We can't select certain types of people that otherwise meet income guidelines and say they can't be eligible. And is the intent of the amendment to say that it will just be affordable housing on that site?,portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"We also think with the pending height bonuses for affordable housing, that will further incent development of affordable housing, but  We don't have a specific project in front of us that we're scoping out at this point. I appreciate Ms. [PERSON] bringing this issue up and perhaps [ORGANIZATION] there could be a little more specificity added to the amendment because the [STREET] it reads now is just affordable housing and it doesn't specify is that all of it, half of it, a mixed � does that mean there's two units that are affordable and the rest of it is market-rate?  I don't think we're going to know. PERSON1 may want to comment on that, too.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Again, remember, this is an urban renewal plan and a projected –  projected revenues and expenditures not a budget not a project plan and we have so many milestones to pass i mean right now this is a fire bureau maintenance facility right that's what it is if you go you can go there [ORGANIZATION] that's what it is we have a long [STREET] to go from that being a fire bureau maintenance facility to having it be a housing project of any character and what has happened here is the commissioner in charge of [ORGANIZATION] has laid down a marker and said there's going to be affordable housing there And we cannot, we can guess at a number, but that's all we can do [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"So could we amend the, it's a policy statement, so we're not going to say there's going to be 200 units of 0 to 60 or whatever, but could we amend it to say there'd be a substantial component of affordable housing? Well, let's let [ORGANIZATION] come back up and comment on that in a bit. He looks like he has a thought or two on that question.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Come on up, please. hey there um so i was at the zedel urban hackathon and i actually got an award from them for having an innovative concept of just reducing the cost by having integrated living schooling and startup space but i digress i really would like to see some affordable housing and right now in [ORGANIZATION] they're having a work session on the inclusionary  zoning bill, so it's great that you guys aren't going to vote on that [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"It's actually less predictable than what we know in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], we know we're talking about new projects. And so you can, you know, there's a lot of experience around doing new construction, affordable housing projects, what you could get for your dollars.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], I think it's more likely that it will be a –  customized mixed-use development, and so how affordable housing appears in the triangle, I think, will be different than what we're talking about in [LOCATION]. That being said, there's probably ways we could craft some minimum. We have to keep in mind that dollars are a lot smaller in LOC2, so the simple math on that would suggest that,  under the city's current formula of subsidizing units, you know, I don't, I mean, we can do the math quickly, but you're talking about something on the order of  you know, [DATE], [DATE], 35 units.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,It's it's so so I we've talked about as Commissioner [PERSON] highlighted that this is a [STREET] where we might be able to get more affordable housing based on different bonuses.,portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,And and and that might be the most that might be might be the formula that gets us to a bigger number. But we don't know any of that right now. And and an affordable housing alone is not going to.  maximize the development potential of [ORGANIZATION].,portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"So I do think we should anticipate that we're going to want to attract other forms of development in the triangle in addition to affordable housing. There just isn't enough, I think, money to make affordable housing happen there without some corresponding market development, whether it's commercial or residential or some other institutional use. Could you point me to where I have the language written down as to what the amendment is?",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"But this is all still futuristic thinking. I take Ms. [PERSON]'s point and Ms. [PERSON]'s point about  I believe a modicum of affordable housing on this site is appropriate, but how you do that will matter because it's a difficult site. It is next to a freight rail line and a light rail line and a truck corridor and a big...",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"Okay. I'm comfortable with making a commitment that there's going to be affordable housing there, but not trying to quantify that because that's trying to see around about three or four corners at once, and I don't think we can do that. And can I just clarify from a process standpoint, there will be, in addition to [ORGANIZATION] budgets, the fact that these properties are city-owned and so the disposition will go through city council.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"And I think, as you just pointed out, there's going to be several bites at this apple that council is going to have as this site, [ORGANIZATION], redevelops. I think this is a pretty substantial commitment to say affordable housing is going to be part of this deal. I'm probably not going to vote for the expansion.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"I just would like to point out that the language that you have in one instance directs that it will all be affordable housing. [DATE] second says shall be included in a larger development site that will be developed as affordable housing. Boom, that's it.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"The first half says there will be a requirement for affordable housing. So if that's okay with you, I just want to make that clear. I'm fine.",portland
03_25_2015,homeless,"about homeless folks that were in the park smoking and how the latitude of the law in [ORGANIZATION] and areas of [PERSON], which we are about to adopt, the latitude that the security and the police have for going after people that are smoking is absolutely atrocious and horrible. Okay, we got a gal that had really bad fibromyalgia and the officers there took her down to the ground and tore her up really bad. Okay, it's on the radio, it's all, you can hear it all, it's on the video and such.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"That's right. Thank you very much Anyone want to speak on this item if not it moves to second reading and option [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you very much Okay, 315  Authorized sale of land at 815 Northwest Nato Parkway to [ORGANIZATION] for approximately $8.8 million to be credited to the affordable housing set-aside budget in the downtown waterfront urban renewal area.",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,"With this action, the affordable housing set-aside budget for the downtown waterfront urban renewal area will receive almost $9 million from the pre-agreed land sale and an associated loan payoff. And we have [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] to answer any questions if [ORGANIZATION] Members have them. Questions for [PERSON]?",portland
03_25_2015,affordable housing,Thank you. And this is $9 million more for the downtown waterfront that can be spent on affordable housing. Aye.,portland
03_25_2015,homeless,"I  I hope that you'll be able to move this forward quickly, and I hope that we will have a little bit more conversation on the ability to literally ban the box in addition to these procedural – there's about 10 pages of [ORGANIZATION] that get into all these little 23 dot this dot that. But most often, and with the T-Streamer exam, I'm here to you about the homeless issue, and I think one problem we've had here is not connecting the dots. If we want to not have 3,000 people sleeping on the streets of [ORGANIZATION], which seems to be the position of the [ORGANIZATION] Business Alliance, and they generally support this ordinance, then we need to have real conversations about the labor market and moving more people into sustainable jobs.",portland
03_25_2015,homeless,I can't get in anywhere. I'm at risk right now being homeless because I can't get in anywhere. I can't even display these in my home because they mean nothing to me anymore.,portland
06_07_2018,homelessness,"Shrink that one a little bit and maybe –  And going forward, this says, you might recognize this, this is based on the Mayor's [ORGANIZATION] dashboard that we released [ORGANIZATION]. This is updated with the adopted budget information, and it's by Mayor's priorities, and you can actually click on the priority here, increasing housing options and reducing homelessness, and see what decision packages are going to that priority area. You can also select by bureau, too, to see which bureau, like [ORGANIZATION], for instance, can see all their decision packages going to that particular category.",portland
06_07_2018,homeless; affordable housing,"So we have it by bureau. And for [ORGANIZATION], for example, their biggest expense is on affordable housing and homeless services. And you can hover over to see what those actual programs are.",portland
06_07_2018,homelessness,"I'm grateful that we're continuing an innovative program launched by [ORGANIZATION] to build capacity in business districts, particularly in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. I am pleased that we're continuing to fund our partnership with ORG1. I am thrilled that we have put in record funding to address what I think is morally the most urgent issue of our time, which is homelessness, and the record funding for ORG2 and for addressing other aspects of this crisis I think this council should be very proud of.",portland
06_07_2018,homeless; homelessness,"So I'll be watching that closely. I'm very pleased we increased our commitment to keeping people in their housing through eviction prevention, as well as providing more shelter to people experiencing homelessness. I think we're the only [ORGANIZATION] city that saw a decrease in homeless individuals on the [STREET], not homeless overall, but on the [STREET], which is something to be proud of.",portland
06_07_2018,homeless,"But I hope as the public that we represent evaluates this budget, and I hope they do use the cool budget tool that you outlined earlier, they will see that the priorities that are funded in this budget, I believe, are the same.  are highly consistent with the priorities of the people who live in this community who pay the bills around here. We focused on the homeless issue. We focused on livability issues.",portland
06_07_2018,affordable housing,We focused on affordable housing issues. We focused on public safety issues. We focused on the parks and critical transportation infrastructure.,portland
05_13_2015,homeless,"Thanks very much. Okay, one more, 465. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless issues.",portland
05_13_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"Basic services like streets, investing in affordable housing, making good on our commitment to public safety, and to changing the relationship between the police bureau and the community through how we deal with people suffering from mental illness, and investing in our kids. This budget reflects about $30.4 million of new funding for basic services, including over $19 million allocated to transportation projects, $6 million for affordable housing and homeless services, and remember that that $6 million proposed is on the budget. on top of more than $90 million already in the city budget for housing from all sources, for a total of nearly $100 million invested into housing.",portland
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"FAC0 is relatively unchanged from a budget perspective. You will see the affordable housing dollars that were moved forward as part of our discussion [ORGANIZATION], but on the ground we are beginning progress on projects like the [ORGANIZATION] project. And then obviously we have the elimination of –  budget for the [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] as well as [ORGANIZATION] which was closed down as a result of the budget amendments.",portland
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"It's a cumulative number, the percentages. So when you look on the right-hand column, if you say, how are we tracking in terms of our set-aside and where are we ending up, you can see that in the [ORGANIZATION] column, the third column there, that's where we'll be as a result of  of our expenditures in affordable housing in [LOCATION]. On the far right is where we're tracking.",portland
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"Okay. Because I think that's a really interesting graphic that you just showed us. And to me, having affordable housing in neighborhoods is part of a healthy neighborhood.",portland
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], as we talked about earlier, and we've talked about a lot over [ORGANIZATION],  The budget for [ORGANIZATION], if you look out [LOCATION], has pretty much been spoken for through all of our conversations with our partners, whether it be our affordable housing partners with [ORGANIZATION], with [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2. So what you see in the near term in [ORGANIZATION] budget is the money being set aside for the FAC0 that we discussed, the affordable housing project project,  money being set aside for the construction of bond and money beginning to be set aside for the completion of the greenway. Those really are the near-term priorities for the district, in addition to our initial investment in a project alongside [ORGANIZATION] as well.",portland
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"As I mentioned, we still have a significant amount of our $8 million loan to [ORGANIZATION] to disperse, so I'm assuming that will happen in [ORGANIZATION]. So I think what's fascinating about [ORGANIZATION] is if you look at the bar chart here, you have this nice distribution of investments, and I think that really does reflect our ability to invest across a lot of different priority areas, and it's not simply focused on property redevelopment. There's a fair amount that goes into infrastructure, to working with the small business community, and we also obviously have a significant commitment to affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"I really think that the recent, you know, [ORGANIZATION] budget proposal kind of brings to light a major factor as to why you need to raise to 15 at a bare minimum. We're talking about, [ORGANIZATION] asked the gentleman here, you know, so why is a housing not included? Right.  for healthy complete neighborhoods um it's just my opinion as a Portlander that's kind of a big deal with healthy complete neighborhoods as affordable housing um when the rent going up skyrocketing left",portland
05_13_2015,homeless,"And we're going to talk about your [TIME] wage and the level of benefits you get. and why you can't find the money to pay the hardworking people who save the lives of the homeless the police push around, $15 an hour at [ORGANIZATION], $15 an hour [PERSON]. You, with your poor policies, make it very difficult.",portland
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"That's appalling and it also makes you feel sort of hopeless like that's so bad. What hope do we have here? Well, I think [ORGANIZATION] proves over and over again on lots of subjects whether it's the environment or Thinking about workers or thinking about affordable housing that we don't want to be a passive passenger on a on a trip We don't want to be on we are going to chart our own course and say no we're gonna actually try to do with our own tools what we can to craft a different kind of economy here and",portland
05_13_2015,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION]'s action plan will focus on coordinating internally to better promote affordable housing and housing preservation and economic development. [ORGANIZATION] is working with the [ORGANIZATION] Housing Bureau and the [ORGANIZATION] Development Commission to find opportunities for joint or coordinated actions. And [PERSON] will have a proposed draft [ORGANIZATION] with review time before it goes to the [LOCATION] and ultimately [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION].,portland
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"We are culturally responsive in providing immigration legal services, refugee resettlement, pregnancy and new family support, and licensed adoption services. Our culturally specific services through [ORGANIZATION] serve 15,000 Latino community members [ORGANIZATION], including anti-poverty programs, school-based programs, and [ORGANIZATION], which serves women fleeing domestic violence and sexual assault. We own property within [ORGANIZATION], including offices and affordable housing communities.",portland
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"So housing does have to be addressed separately. We need affordable housing by design and economic prosperity through living wage jobs in the corridor. I've said it in many community spaces, but I do strongly believe that housing is a community right.",portland
05_13_2015,affordable housing,"It's a great, thoughtful planning process. It reminds me of my  my young days when I served on [ORGANIZATION] and how we figured out things like, you know, to do a tunnel or not at the zoo, things like that. So you're grappling with, you know, issues that are very similar, but I think with a new special emphasis on displacement of people and on affordable housing as considerations.",portland
03_06_2019,homeless,"For the record, [ORGANIZATION], and it's [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], but it's warm enough in here I think that we don't need this. So, we've heard Mr. [PERSON] talk about people in mental health crisis and the number of them that end up dead. We've heard [ORGANIZATION]'s presentation touched on the need to really work with data, and even though we occasionally publish some  I don't know if it's really progress to say that a new [INSTITUTION] is opening up.",portland
03_06_2019,homeless,"Occasionally, the transition projects, the main subcontractor for [ORGANIZATION]...  will do their ORG1 or social media posts that says... I don't know if they did in [ORGANIZATION], because here with [LOCATION] coming in like a lion, two of [DATE] of [LOCATION], weather was so severe that we had emergency shelter open, so they would maybe say the number of people they sheltered, and then talk about four people transitioned into housing. But that really shouldn't be spoken of as an accomplishment necessarily, because what we have is a housing system where there's been...  almost zero growth.",portland
03_06_2019,homeless,"And so when we say somebody was put into housing, what we mean is that another person either lost their housing or lost their life. And for [ORGANIZATION] of the homeless and the housing emergency crisis, we've banded about the number from the point-in-time count. But we've never publicly said  brought forth the funded parties, and worked with the real data.",portland
03_06_2019,homelessness,"The city and the county fund, through a major Fortune 500 corporation, information service products, sometimes called [ORGANIZATION], sometimes called [ORGANIZATION]. And what [ORGANIZATION] really would do, or does, except we don't ask it what it's doing, is it tells us that there are people who have chronic homelessness for [ORGANIZATION]...  and that we intend to extend their homelessness for an equal length of time instead of developing methods to better engage with those people and end their chronic homelessness, which, of course, gets to the point of making homes. It's unfortunate that we're coming up on [ORGANIZATION] since the good people of this county have passed a bond across the [LOCATION] region, and I don't think you could find any ordinary people  who feel they've been engaged in that process.",portland
03_06_2019,homeless,"We have some nice blips on the radar on the horizon, [ORGANIZATION] funding for homeless studies and stuff like that. But I think the answer is with the community, there needs to be more public engagement and honest talk about past mistakes or where we didn't make enough traction. Thank you very much.",portland
03_06_2019,housing crisis,"I think if we're really going to be a smart city, if we're going to really address the housing crisis that we face, some of this information needs to filter out so that we know how many buildings, it's a separate department, but how many buildings are marked with the red [ORGANIZATION], how many are maybe not being as aggressively pursued as nuisances or whatever it takes to get property demolished  in a city that has great need. I'm not the strongest pro-capital, free market real estate person here. Since when I came to the city, we had a big hole in the ground sitting behind [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_06_2019,affordable housing,"So one of the other last pieces I just want to mention, as we think about how we grow and trading and evaluating these public goods, we want affordable housing, but we also need quality and livability and sustainability. We are not tracking and measuring these impacts ourselves. So one of the things that we're working on is a sustainability scorecard.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing; houseless,"Those who are low income, have disabilities, are people of color and veterans of our generation. We are particularly concerned with the increasing population of houseless elders, the continuing shortage of affordable housing, long waiting lists for public housing meant for elders and people with disabilities, and the often dreadful state of living conditions in available public housing. To this latter end, we unequivocally support the efforts of public housing tenants and indeed any low-income tenants to organize tenant unions such as [ORGANIZATION] to empower themselves for collective demands for better living conditions and treatment.",portland
03_13_2019,housing insecurity,"You're liable to be...  in some situation of housing insecurity or even on the streets while you're waiting. So, you know, that is definitely a concern for, you know, why are people there when there's supposedly a safety net? Because there isn't a big enough safety net, too many holes.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And the second is the potential for affordable housing. Currently, the proposal suggests that we could get up to 2,000 units and 40% of them would be available at some point  level of affordability but that's not a promise or a guarantee. It's a possibility and given the city's investment in this area I want to not lose sight of the potential especially given the fact we've got a light rail stop there and it would be just a prime area for affordable workforce housing.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And one of the developments that arose as a result of that [ORGANIZATION] was FAC0, which is 40% affordable housing. And that has been an unqualified success in FAC1, a rare success story in FAC1. And I've been talking to the property owners since then, and there's a waiting list for that affordable housing.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"So one of the catalysts for this new [ORGANIZATION] was to help address that waiting list for affordable housing. Okay. So with that, why don't we switch over to the presentation and I'll kind of walk you through that in a little bit more detail.",portland
03_13_2019,housing crisis,"I have said many times we've always had a housing crisis for someone, but I didn't realize it included [ORGANIZATION]. So, thank you. And full disclosure, Mayor, I did a little research on you and I see you have no connection to [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And I'm not suggesting that we build exactly in [ORGANIZATION] what we built in [PERSON], but  What you've got there in [PERSON] is you've got mixed use right up against the [ORGANIZATION] line. You have shops, restaurants, you have a range of housing options in [PERSON], and again including affordable housing. There is a strong partnership between [ORGANIZATION] and affordable housing partners.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,Right. And I just want to also add that there's a human solutions building that's going up there with affordable housing. So I know that this community has been really intentional about the concern that Commissioner [PERSON] and I share.,portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And what I'm, what we've been very intentional, Commissioner, in our discussion with the developers about incorporating affordable housing. I'm not, I don't work for [ORGANIZATION], but I'm obviously well aware of the need for affordable housing. So that has been front and center in our discussions all the [STREET] through.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"So when you say affordable housing, what do you mean? Again, I'm not a housing expert, but whatever the definition is of affordable housing, the intent here is that 40% of the units that are built will be affordable. It will probably be 60% to 80% MFI, which is basically...",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"I mean, I think it's important that we actually say the number as compared to using the term affordable housing because that's such an oxymoron statement, right? Because I can't tell you what's affordable for you, and you certainly can't tell me what's affordable for me. But we need to know what is the income you need to live there.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"But, again, I just want to emphasize affordable housing in no [STREET], shape, or form has been an afterthought to this discussion. So...  So you saw the pictures of what this area of FAC0 looks like [ORGANIZATION]. This is an architectural rendering of what we would like FAC0 to become.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"But when we're talking about market rate housing and affordable housing, when we're putting 1,500 to 2,000 housing units in here, that creates a lot more housing options for everyone. And then my last slide here is the other corner of this area of FAC0. This is at FAC1 and Everett [STREET].",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"Yeah, Commissioner, we traditionally haven't done development agreements on [ORGANIZATION]s, but there are certainly deal points, if you will, on the funding. And so the funding of the second [ORGANIZATION] that we want, I mean, the first [ORGANIZATION] is fully funded, so that's not an issue. But if we think about bringing that second [ORGANIZATION] forward, we're looking at some markers in terms of number of certain blocks developing and a Commissioner [PERSON]'s point about,  ensuring that affordable housing is part of that component as well.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"But just know that I'm concerned that we don't have a model yet of how we've done this right. So I would love to see this one be a model of how we've done it right. And that real affordable housing, a real housing that people can afford to live in is a result of the actions that were taken.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"So if council wants to include a finding or a directive in there that says it's going to be 40% affordable housing, you know, whatever...  Whatever issues are important to the council, we can absolutely embed those in a formation ordinance for sub-signalities. I want to raise a cautionary flag on that. I do not support that strategy because that backs us into a financial model that we may or may not be able to afford, and it may create a market dynamic that that community just can't support.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"You'll also need to share in the cost of the infrastructure and affordable housing because it's impossible to simply get that by planning and requirements. Otherwise, we'd have it there by now. Mainly, I just encourage you to get to know these property owners, and they're going to be here [ORGANIZATION].",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"In the past, I have worked for a developer that has built multi-use tax-exempt properties in northeast [ORGANIZATION], and instead of, I took it upon myself to not just allow them to be  allow the affordable housing. I wanted to make sure that I was reaching out to the community, that I was doing what was best for our residents. So in [ORGANIZATION], I've had open communications with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], the [LOCATION]-BASH program, and [ORGANIZATION], and many more.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,And I find that this particular site is very interesting because there's –  a lot of the problems of the city are present on the site currently and yet there is a tremendous opportunity there. I saw that as one of the prime areas that I would like to personally participate in bringing in some businesses. I think that the timing of some of the development is something that the council could certainly push in a direction that would make it much easier to get things to happen more quickly and to address the affordable housing.,portland
03_13_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"For example, if you  put the affordable housing units up first, then you're not going to have a whole bunch of people worried about, um, not being able to have housing. And it also provides, uh,  places for workers to live, potentially if they're coming in from out of town. Likewise, the problem of the homelessness in the city in that particular area is particularly acute as you're near the highway.",portland
03_13_2019,homeless,"There's lots of danger or perceived danger in the homeless. I've actually been underground as a homeless person. four or five of [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], in [ORGANIZATION], in various places in [ORGANIZATION], and also in GPE2 and in [LOCATION] for 80 percent of [LOCATION], even though that wasn't my intent when I got here.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"I know we need a lot more affordable housing, but we also need market rate housing. We need to have a good mixture of both. And the projects that will follow this [ORGANIZATION] will have a good mix, not a separate building for the people who can only afford the affordable and another building for the people who have a little more money, but they're mixed together in housing units.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"We're seeing displacement occurring now, not from this project, just from gentrification in the area. It is happening now. Our housing bureau is looking at a preference policy for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] because of that displacement.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"But I want to speak to the money. I mean, I don't think that having that much affordable housing with that kind of criteria is realistic, especially not in this town. How about people with no income like me?",portland
03_13_2019,houseless,That's stupid. How better to educate people that houseless people and people of low income are no different than you and me than to put everybody together in one box and have them play together? But I don't understand why it is that more people aren't being helped through this.,portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And I'm going to be looking for, like, real numbers and not just terms like affordable housing. Because, again, I don't think that term means anything anymore, right? I think what we need to talk about is making sure we have housing at every income level, in every neighborhood in the city of [ORGANIZATION], and that [ORGANIZATION] could possibly be that model.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"We now have staff in the room. amend affordable housing preservation and [ORGANIZATION] renter additional protections to make technical changes following adoption of SB608, other technical changes, and clarify the affordable housing exemption. Colleagues with the city's commissioner, please.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"We are clarifying a couple of key places in the ordinance that don't change the policy but add clarity to both landlords and tenants. and we are narrowing the exemption for affordable housing providers. As you may recall, when this ordinance was permanently adopted in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] directed us to convene stakeholders to narrow and refine the affordable housing exemption.",portland
03_13_2019,homelessness,"Aye. When we passed the first temporary relocation assistance ordinance in [ORGANIZATION], we had high hopes for its ability to create a lifeline for vulnerable tenants teetering on the edge of homelessness. I'm pleased to say [PERSON] that not only does data demonstrate that it works, but I believe it was one of several catalysts that spurred greater tenant protections for residents, all renting residents in the state of [ORGANIZATION] through [LOCATION] [DATE].",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"And in fact, within our [ORGANIZATION] member group, we have seen more ridership and folks riding all throughout [ORGANIZATION], including [LOCATION], compared to other conventional ORG1 members. So the [STREET] that [ORGANIZATION] works is that members can sign up online and pay $3 a month by linking their credit or debit card or by choosing the cash option. Portlanders are eligible if they're FAC0 cardholders, residents of affordable housing, if they qualify for utility assistance or other social services.",portland
03_13_2019,homelessness,"So here we see a snapshot of growth for the program. As of [ORGANIZATION], there were 495 [ORGANIZATION] members, riding over 66,000 trips in total, which is about 20% of all [PERSON] trips, all [PERSON] member trips. We've made improvements, have done outreach in populations that tend to get overlooked, such as our populations experiencing homelessness, joblessness, or going through recovery.",portland
03_13_2019,affordable housing,"We strive to facilitate health equity in our communities. This means engaging communities most impacted by health disparities and acknowledging and addressing current and historic injustices and discrimination.

[ORGANIZATION] funding for ORG2 is about $2.7 million, which pays for career coaching provided by a network of 12 community-based partners who serve about 1,900 [ORGANIZATION] through this program. These partners bring strong connections and expertise in serving the program's target populations, including homeless, people at risk of homelessness, ex-offenders, immigrants, residents of neighborhood prosperity initiatives, and communities of color.",portland
03_13_2019,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] situates these partners within a system of resources and services that augment funding for career coaching, multiply the impact of the city's investment, and improve services and outcomes. Building on the city's investment, we incorporate an array of additional funding and services from the [ORGANIZATION] ORG1, [ORGANIZATION] ORG2, [ORGANIZATION] ORG3, [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], and other sources to add over $7 million into the program [DATE]. This includes about $3.5 million to fund more career coaches to serve even more [ORGANIZATION], about $2 million to provide occupational training for participants focusing on target sectors of healthcare, construction, advanced manufacturing, high-tech, truck driving, and financial industry, about $900,000 in on-the-job training and internships for people who lack work experience or recent work experience,  and about $800,000 for rent assistance so that people who are homeless or facing eviction can participate in occupational training and start a job with the result that they can get a job that supports their housing.",portland

For example, during [ORGANIZATION] under the work systems contract, we served 400 chronically homeless people and their average wage is $11.30, you know, average over [LOCATION], which  which sounds lower than minimum wage right now, but it's a great accomplishment for people who experience this homelessness.

01_18_2018,affordable housing,My testimony is related to [ORGANIZATION]. 4. I request that the current requirement to transfer FAR in order to build up to the allowable height be eliminated so that maximum density can be more readily reached without the added and unnecessary financial burden that transfer has on projects.

01_18_2018,affordable housing,"The additional 3-to-[ADDRESS] to prioritize affordable units. And in order to utilize that development in full, the building would need to be high-rise construction.

01_18_2018,affordable housing,"Every cost added to a project impacts the viability of that project. Allowing property owners to build up to the maximum height without the extra cost burden of an FAR transfer after they have met the affordable housing requirement will improve the chances that a larger project will be built, therefore increasing the opportunities for more affordable living units within the central city and larger public benefits that come with the increased housing from [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] fees to property taxes.

01_18_2018,affordable housing,"I am also speaking [ORGANIZATION] in support of the [ORGANIZATION] amendment, which addresses amendment number four, In essence, this amendment would allow for the building of additional market rate and affordable housing when projects meet the 3 to 1 FAR bonus requirements while staying within property heighten limits.

01_18_2018,affordable housing,"Importantly, employing this allowance for central city buildings that are already subject to design review would provide additional needed housing without compromising urban form. And considering the dire need for additional private funds to build our housing infrastructure, any policy that is accretive to our housing supply without compromising design quality is needed and consistent with the city's goals.

01_18_2018,affordable housing,"There's 250 or I don't know the number, but...  that range of housing that's there now. And although it's not affordable housing, I think it's a fair assumption that the new housing, the incomes of the people who live in the new housing, even with the affordable component, will be [STREET] in excess of what's there now, the incomes of the people who live there now.

Also, finally...  I am a little concerned about the tiny house movement for the homeless, only because not just things have gone awry or off track, but  But we could do a lot better job by saying, listen, you have a certain amount of time to be there.",portland

01_18_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], can I just make one observation? Sure. Thank you for your work, not only in micro-housing, but in flagging innovative ways to bring the cost down of affordable housing.",portland
01_18_2017,affordable housing,"Those are two vitally important things. The one thing, though, that I'm going to just gently push back is when we invest in affordable housing with services –  We build apartments, and then we have meeting spaces, and we have on-site health care clinics, and we have other things. So if we divide the units by the total cost of the building, we have a very misleading number of the cost per unit.",portland
01_18_2017,homeless,"I want them to say good and bad, and they should have the right to do that, still receive the grant, and not feel as though in the future they won't continue to receive the grant for their good work that they do in the community, which I agree they do, and also working with the homeless, providing them additional sources of income and resources.  and work, which I think is very beneficial. I just wanted to make it very clear, sometimes when grants are given, there are statements in these grants that want good PR to the city, and when we're dealing with a publication here, I want that to be removed. I want them to have the right to say, I may not like what this commissioner is doing, and I'm going to put it in my publication.",portland
01_18_2017,homeless,"But I do believe that [STREET] routes should function by itself. There's no need to give it any money or any grants for anything  I agree with Commissioner [PERSON] that if you really are homeless, you should go to FAC0 or [ORGANIZATION] and be with other homeless people and figure out what to do. My opinion that [STREET] roots is more poetry, and it doesn't need any money from the city.",portland
01_18_2017,homeless,"And I don't like the idea that somehow [STREET] roots is some –  [STREET] to get valuable information to homeless people, that is not a good argument. So I don't know why the public sector is involved with the thing. Good morning, Commissioners.",portland
01_18_2017,homeless,"So in addition to approving this grant with [ORGANIZATION], I hope that there will be money, as you work with the county on [ORGANIZATION],  to track the ability of people that want to at [STREET] routes, connect with vocational rehab, move into ORG2 and other full-time independent granting work. Not a pressure system where people are afraid to affiliate with [STREET] routes because they're going to be drug into a system they don't want to participate in, but so that people are doing [STREET] routes, have enhanced connectivity with the state VR system, with ORG2,  If they're eligible and comfortable with ORG2 or [PERSON], then that should be open to them. But there are no one-size-fits-all solutions.",portland
01_18_2017,homelessness,"Studies have shown that people are surprisingly not swayed by their position. Their thinking is not swayed by what the media reports, but...  What they give thought to has been shown to be swayed by what media report. And so when it comes to homelessness, you can see how this could be a problem.",portland
01_18_2017,homelessness,"that was released and some concerns we have with the community and i think it is now a better more democratic process i enthusiastically support this particular appropriation and just a couple pieces of context  We have a proud tradition, as Commissioner [PERSON] alludes to, of supporting organizations like [ORGANIZATION]. In fact, one of the cornerstones of our collective efforts to address homelessness is that we fund [ORGANIZATION], which is a publication of [ORGANIZATION] and something dates back, I think, to ORG2, and we are very proud of that relationship.",portland
01_18_2017,homelessness,"Thank you. Also, I think something that's lost in this is if you look at the impact statement, we're reminded that [ORGANIZATION] is at its core a nonprofit that helps people experiencing homelessness, many of whom are experiencing poverty, mental and physical disabilities, create opportunity for themselves, which is why all of us buy [ORGANIZATION].  which is why during this storm a number of us bought more than one copy and sometimes actually paid more than the face value for three booths because we're supporting people in their desire to be self-sufficient. And finally, on the question of their editorial independence, I don't think either [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] or any of the award-winning reporters  have to worry about editorial independence.",portland
01_18_2017,homelessness; affordable housing,"They take us to task on a regular basis on homelessness, affordable housing, super fund, equity, and I would hope that that proud tradition continues whether we fund them or not. Awesome. Hi. PERSON0?",portland
01_18_2017,homeless,Some people think that there needs to be a very strong head-butting and assertion against Governor [PERSON]'s failure to be more supportive of the people of [ORGANIZATION] and their desire not to have their water done in a deal with [ORGANIZATION] and unfortunately you're not state treasurer anymore so you can't get creative about ways that we can stimulate the economy in [ORGANIZATION] and have people living near clean public water and still have good paying jobs. But that's one of the things that [PERSON] constituents look for is for public leaders to engage around the most important issues and water is right up there with keeping our homeless people from dying when they can't get the mental health services they need or the basic shelter they need. Thank you.,portland
01_18_2017,homeless,"It will be some of these folks have already relapsed three or four times, and this would be a different approach to take the care to their homes. And my other question is, will patients who are homeless and being not released to a home where you can visit them be served through this program somehow? I look to build on that in the future.",portland
01_18_2017,homeless,"The more mobile homeless might pose challenges. Yeah. We have another program that we're kind of connecting high utilizers that [STREET], and those individuals are being sought out regardless.",portland
01_18_2017,homeless,"I'm [PERSON], and I support these kind of things for the simple reason is if you have a fire and rescue basically has equipment that they don't use unless there's a fire, it just sits there and they don't use it. DATE0, [LOCATION], I had an experience where some homeless guy was begging for money outside of FAC0 on FAC1. And luckily, the [INSTITUTION] arrived about the same time the policeman or the county sheriff.",portland
01_18_2017,houseless,"So that's going to be a very...  tricky issue with the number of houseless people we have here. And it's something that I, dealing with the houseless community, am going to have to tell them. Well, you might reduce your risk of death if you lie to your discharge person at the hospital and say that you live somewhere.",portland
01_29_2020,homeless,DATE0 and of course the doctors aren't getting paid so I think they can figure out what injured and pissed off feels like. There's an absent chair here in the council chambers. As a child they used to play musical chairs with music and take a chair away and that's what they're doing to the homeless people and other people such as myself that have been injured and It never got any justice.,portland

01_29_2020,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], the [LOCATION], the [ORGANIZATION], and ORG6. I've provided maps for the property and what I would suggest to you is that we floated these properties kind of in a group because all six of these properties are challenged in one [STREET] or another. Two of the properties have ground tanks on them.",portland
01_29_2020,houseless,"If we own these properties and there's really no rush in actually acquiring the money that the sale would have. You said you talked to the office, [ORGANIZATION], and they didn't see any opportunity to utilize these five pieces of land for folks who are suffering on our [STREET]? No.",portland
01_29_2020,homelessness,"I have to trust the judgment of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. As I said, these properties are kind of awkward. And there are facilities.",portland
01_29_2020,houseless,"And again, I'm just asking a question and would like to make sure that we're not giving away property that we could temporarily use to house our houseless folks. So thank you. Could I ask a follow-up on this question?",portland
01_29_2020,homeless,"You may be several steps ahead of me. Is there currently any centralized disposition process that would include [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]? The process that we went through, this all began [ORGANIZATION] when we were trying to sell a piece of property, and it turned into a huge kerfuffle.",portland
01_29_2020,homelessness,"So there is a process, and I tried to be careful and mention for both Commissioner [PERSON]'s benefit and Commissioner [PERSON]'s benefit, that it includes talking to [ORGANIZATION] and to ORG1. And I can only... I can only trust that they know what they need and where they need it.",portland
01_29_2020,affordable housing,"The city declared a housing state of emergency, and what that did was it removed some of the impediments to locating both shelter and affordable housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. So actually, as the state takes up their question of the housing emergency, they're actually looking at the code that we adopted [ORGANIZATION]. I mean, and I wish we could apply the same rules to federal, metro, and county-owned property as well, instead of returning property to the private market.",portland
01_29_2020,homeless,"And then, you know, [ORGANIZATION] wouldn't have to be paying $40 for me to go through and screen on every, you know, [STREET] that isn't available because they're very mysterious about whether they have an apartment available or not. So, yeah, there are low risk homeless people that you could put on these properties. Thank you.",portland
01_29_2020,homeless,"But the point is, I think the gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] has done all he can. One of the problems is that the extent of his procedure that he's been instructed in is to go to ORG1 and go to ORG2. In a different context, ORG2 is administered by an addict.",portland
01_29_2020,homeless,[ORGANIZATION] is addicted to taking money and dumping it on transition projects after skimming off a little bit to staff [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] and ORG2 were not envisioned or assisted. in their birth by [ORGANIZATION].,portland
01_29_2020,homeless,"But the idea that these properties might be difficult to sell is all the more reason to consider that even if it's a short-term camp that doesn't have the duration of [ORGANIZATION] or, you know, [ORGANIZATION] was able to move. It seems like 1800 FAC0 is not very far from [ORGANIZATION], which we're trying to send out to [PERSON], where some people are saying, oh my gosh, homeless people might live next to the library that they spend their whole day in anyway.",portland
01_29_2020,homeless,"And so for all these other crises, the homeless crisis, that is a real crisis. The climate crisis, that is a real crisis. The two crises that I'm even speaking about affect our community and affect how the city of [ORGANIZATION] is going to even operate and whether or not we're going to be able to sustain for [ORGANIZATION] to come.",portland
01_29_2020,homeless,"When I say community partners, I'm talking about community partners that will help with the homeless crisis, community partners that will also help with our environmental crisis that we're currently in, and also have people that would be able to give bids for and estimates on what materials are going to need to bring these lands up to code. I think that has to happen before the next report. And I'm out of time.",portland

01_29_2020,homelessness,"Even with those measures in [STREET], there are still members of our community who face barriers to participation, especially among communities of color, immigrant and refugee communities, youth, elders, and people experiencing homelessness. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention that [ORGANIZATION] does not have a proud history when it comes to the rights of African Americans. I want to acknowledge it's been [ORGANIZATION] since black people could live in [ORGANIZATION] by law, And it's been [ORGANIZATION] since black people were granted the right to vote, which is a story that often gets lost when we celebrate the past.",portland

No, this is – there's no presentation unless you have questions, but –  this is simply [ORGANIZATION] the council did authorize the first acquisition under the affordable housing bond measure the [ORGANIZATION] apartments and so this uh this item basically allows [ORGANIZATION] to assume all the miscellaneous contracts associated with that acquisition everything from landscaping services to well smoke detectors all those things all those services  PERSON1, the [ORGANIZATION] Director, is here if there are questions. So this is more in the nature of a housekeeping matter?",portland
01_04_2017,homeless,"We had some questions about when [ORGANIZATION] goes out and does contracts,  We're concerned about that. We're getting emails about the organization. Is it [PERSON] that runs most of the homeless under housing?",portland
01_04_2017,homeless,"I hate these initials. I really do because I get confused with all these initials. But the contractors that deal with the homeless people, if they're selling stuff, I want them in jail.",portland

If anybody walked into [ORGANIZATION] and said they were homeless and need help, I'd refer them to FAC0, and I have. And another resource is [ORGANIZATION].  is another [STREET].",portland
01_04_2017,homeless,"So if people are trying to do things, I'm just making a reference, like these apartments, people are trying to do something, and whether they're selling coats or something, they're just attempting to do something.

This ordinance that you have before you is an amendment to ORG1, ORG2, that further advances this work. It accommodates council funding from DATE2 fall bump, or [ORGANIZATION] fall bump, to provide expanded emergency services and shelter and housing placement activities that are already.",portland
02_15_2017,homelessness,"Then, to follow that up, you get to read in the paper about other people discussing what to do with your life, about how shelters and overpriced units so small you can't even invite a friend over are a solution to homelessness rather than the underlying cause. There's experiences like these that make me want to show up to public meetings and say, hey, you're killing me. But then when I show up to these meetings, for example, [ORGANIZATION],  After listening to them kill [TIME] congratulating one another, they say, hey, could you please keep it to [TIME] because we're running out of time here.",portland
02_15_2017,homeless,"Now we're – well, okay, I missed the funding opportunity to speak about that. But now we're discussing handing $3 million to an agency that has not involved homeless people in their decision-making process. Okay.",portland
02_15_2017,homeless,"On the contrary, I tried showing up to a [ORGANIZATION] meeting [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON] was blatantly turning homeless people away at the door. It was a public meeting about homeless people. This is not [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_15_2017,homeless,"It's at the county, and they have a specific subcommittee that is made up of homeless men and women that have input into the plan. Well, I've been looking for meetings. I haven't found one.",portland

02_15_2017,homeless,"Not all homeless people agree with me. I can't speak for everybody, and that's the whole point. We need to involve, you know, talk to them, not just the select few who can manage to get emailed about this vague meeting somewhere.",portland
02_15_2017,homeless,"and yet he got a good job later on and [ORGANIZATION] treated him quite well. And why don't you treat homeless people and try to make sure when they're cold and they have to use the bathroom. You know, if you use the bathroom in the bushes, it's indecency.",portland
02_15_2017,homeless,"When you go into FAC0, there's a big sign in the front door that we treat people here like human beings, even if they do or don't make it in this city. And my father made it in this city, but he was homeless. Thank you, sir.",portland
02_15_2017,homeless,"That will be posted online, so I do encourage you to review the...  presentation, and it was live at the time also, I believe. One of the things that stuck with me the most was in [ORGANIZATION], 6,[ADDRESS] is that 6,000 people became homeless.",portland
02_15_2017,homelessness,We're fundamentally nonpartisan and have really no stake in what happens  kinds of stories we're telling around these themes. We're trying to break ground on important issues like housing and homelessness to try to understand how to better allocate resources and bring something new to the table that is sometimes beyond the scope of what government actually can afford to do because it's very expensive to run these data projects. And we have  all of these folks that are coming out from some of the best technical areas in [ORGANIZATION] working together on these super teams alongside teams with government.,portland
02_15_2017,homelessness,"And it's not even about open data as an issue. It's about every other issue that data is a part of. And so if we can understand the [ORGANIZATION] budget better to apply toward things like emergency response and homelessness and housing, we think it benefits everybody.",portland
02_15_2017,homeless; homelessness,"Thank you. This allocation of funds was a part of the discussion around funds associated with the [ORGANIZATION] planning effort, specifically looking at legal services for individuals that were homeless or at risk of homelessness. And in the partition of the responsibilities between the city, the joint office, and the county, renter protections stayed with the city.",portland
02_15_2017,homeless,"It was also mentioned during our meeting [ORGANIZATION] talking about housing issues, that we have a number of organizations here like [ORGANIZATION] outside in [ORGANIZATION] and others that work with homeless youth, and they have their own set of job training programs. And we had quite a...  Interesting conversation about their results. I think they had something like 180 people participate in their program, 40 actually found employment.",portland
02_15_2017,homeless,"And it just occurred to me as I was reading the [ORGANIZATION] to this and Commissioner [PERSON]'s comments that this is sort of center of target in some of those opportunities areas. If you're ever looking for a broadening of those opportunities, it might be interesting to go beyond the juvenile justice program and start looking at the homeless youth continuum as maybe another potential source. And we've been working with the county on this for [ORGANIZATION], I think.",portland
02_15_2017,affordable housing,"Second. And number four, finally, and this one is not currently in the recommended draft that I'd like to introduce for consideration, I'd like to add a technical fix to Recap 8 that would implement the council's intent from [ORGANIZATION] related to inclusionary housing parking requirements. That is, waive parking requirements for projects that build affordable housing and require parking for those that pay a fee in lieu.",portland
02_15_2017,affordable housing,"uh to be clear this is not a major change or a departure from current policy and the status quo because far and hide allowances remain the same and it's not the master stroke that's going to solve the city's housing deficit but it does allow for incremental progress towards some of the city's most challenging housing goals and it also has the additive benefit of not costing the city anything to implement  Finally, as demonstrated by the letters, which I believe were submitted to members of the council and have copies of those, if you haven't received those, this amendment has support from widespread support from both the affordable housing community and the market rate development community and really presents an opportunity to allow those communities to have another tool to try and  could bring more units online in the city.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"And we are a group of housing advocates, affordable housing providers, and community members, educators, health care providers, labor folks interested and concerned about affordability in our community.

And we just want to put something on the table for your future consideration.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"There are a group of cities that use an elevated fee structure to do a couple of things, to deter some demolitions from occurring when it's not in the community's best interest or it doesn't increase density or it doesn't increase density. Where it doesn't create new affordability But when demolitions do go forward a in the case of these cities $10,000 fee is collected and contributed to an affordable housing account and That affordable housing account then gets used to help mitigate the loss of some of that lost affordability through again some demolitions and I  It allows for first-time homeowners who aren't able to break into the market to have extra funds to purchase their first-time family home.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"Number two, Mayor, on the question of what Commissioner [PERSON] is going to look at on potentially a fee for affordable housing and the other issues that you've identified, what's the time frame that you're going to set for something coming back to us? Yeah, I think it's – and some of these things are going to take longer than others. On the issue of hazardous materials, I think that one can be done pretty quickly, probably [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"Simple delays, be they [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION], have been a feeble solution. Demolitions of up to 370 affordable houses a year valued at $100 million dwarfs the city's efforts at spending $20 million to support affordable housing. Can we really achieve affordable housing through demolition?",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"And I just wanted to talk about a couple of things that you mentioned in your interview with [ORGANIZATION] that I think inform your decisions, not necessarily about both related to this ordinance, but also related to the other things that you were talking about. So, oops, you rejected two fallacies during that interview. First, that demolitions provide affordable housing, and second, that preservation undermines density.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"I have some specific ideas as to how you can reduce demolitions while promoting density, affordable housing, and historic preservation. Okay. Obviously, we need to reduce incentives for demolition.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,We need to increase incentives for preservation. Some specific ideas are to combine historic preservation and affordable housing incentives. [ORGANIZATION] issued a [ORGANIZATION] report on credits and bonuses that is really helpful.,portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, so these are some of the solutions that other cities employ. I point these out because I'm asking you to please not stop at the changes that are proposed [ORGANIZATION]. Fix the code and look creatively at bonuses and credits to provide affordable housing and density.",portland
02_12_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I am concerned about our affordable housing crisis, specifically that when houses are demolished, the replacements cannot be as affordable. For the same reasons that the greenest building is the one already built, the most affordable home is also the one already built. Plus, when single-family homes are demolished, we can lose homeownership and therefore stability in our communities.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"We lose stability also for our families, for current homeowners, families starting out, and in the equity and heritage that is passed down to future generations. We must disincentivize demolishing our single-family homes to curb and counter the market forces that destroy our affordable housing stock. But I am also concerned that our efforts to increase our supply are resulting in the demolition of our truly affordable homes.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"One step forward, three steps back. The need for affordable housing cannot be met by policies and projects that encourage demolishing our existing low-cost homes. Without our fixer-uppers, the housing stock will be affordable only for those who are not disadvantaged or moved here from out of state.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"Without the truly affordable housing, the homes that are already built, people are being displaced to places that will continue the problem that it was intended to solve. Pending legislation in [ORGANIZATION] includes increasing financing for affordable housing, directing cities and counties to ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing, and removing the ban on inclusionary zoning, thereby allowing municipalities to require developers to reserve a certain percentage of their units for low- or moderate-income families. All are good concepts and are for a good and necessary cause.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"But if they pass without conditions that protect our existing homes from demolition, the consequences will be the opposite of their intentions. If the city does not work with the state to keep those incentives for creating affordable housing from being applied where existing housing stock would be destroyed, they will be but a pretense that we are dealing with the affordability crisis. [ORGANIZATION] strategy talks about helping people repair and maintain their homes this needs to be the focus for increasing affordability they are talking about locating new affordable housing in empty lots that should be the rule they talk about helping people add value to their property so they can afford to stay in their homes for example by adding accessory dwelling units we must be sure this is not just talk  that it becomes citywide and that we are using our influence to build it into state laws as well.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"We must save our existing affordable housing from both private and public efforts. If we really are looking out for the disadvantaged lower-income citizens and our young families, we must make sure that we are looking forward to see who will benefit, the neighbor who no longer has a neighborhood or the opportunity to own their own home or the developer who is encouraged to make their money under the guise of sacrifice for the common good. We know that the city intends to do the right thing, but we're not sure that we are not committing the urban renewal mistake of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor [PERSON], for your commitment to working on the infill standards and development process. As requested by 40 neighborhood associations, we call for the creation of a task force to make the comprehensive plans, policies 5.33 and 4.133. 4.13 for the production of affordable housing and neighborhood character a reality",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"The issues associated with demolition regulation are many, from preservation of viable, affordable housing, protection of public health from demolition process, preservation of cultural and historic resources that are important to the character of our city, and not least, the common courtesy of informing neighbors of an impending demolition. These all need to be addressed, if not now, in the very near future. DATE0, I found online the [PERSON] 2455-200 rewrite on the agenda for [LOCATION], presuming that is the version under consideration.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"A [ORGANIZATION] plan review can take [ORGANIZATION] and more with appeals and adjustment. A developer has little or nothing to gain from engaging in any kind of negotiation. I see the unintended consequences of making it easier to demolish viable, affordable housing without neighborhood assistance.",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"But I also believe that demos are another variable leading to the lack of affordable housing product in our city, which is, I think, approaching crisis level. Okay. i encourage you to explore ways to increase incentives for non-profit and for-profit developers to build homes that are affordable to low and middle-income families to buy the tax abatements and the sdcs are set there and are are great",portland
02_12_2015,affordable housing,"It's very challenging to figure out how to manage that. And I know that your staff in planning and sustainability are working hard on code language, the comprehensive plan, looking at design and those kinds of issues.

01_30_2019,homeless,"I realize, however, that statute rarely offers total solutions. To be sure, some rights, the right to vote and to representation, are endangered to the homeless. It also, however, occurs to me that part and parcel to liberty is the right to drop out, to go off the grid.",portland
01_30_2019,homeless,[ORGANIZATION] would strip away the voices of undocumented citizens if it could. It would silence the voices of the homeless if it could. I implore this council not to be an accomplice to that crime.,portland
01_30_2019,homeless,"Then lastly, just for the record, why are you not giving me your opinion to the question I presented back in [ORGANIZATION]? And I want to get off the subject just for [TIME] about the homeless. I don't see any of these people stepping up.",portland
01_30_2019,homeless,"When my building got burnt down 77,000 square feet, one of the cars got broke into in my business [ORGANIZATION]. And then the homeless, we caught him stealing one of my vans, and he's being convicted of that. So there's a little bit of how we help the homeless help us.",portland
01_30_2019,homeless,"Welcome. Thank you for letting me come in and speak, but I want to say hello, everyone. I was homeless, and we found a [STREET] to live.",portland
01_30_2019,homeless,"It devastated me because we were homeless, and he was scamming everybody that was in that home. He took advantage of the homeless situation, and this is not right. So I would request and I would like to know if every recovery home, say recovery homes, to be audited.",portland
01_30_2019,homeless,"to make sure that they have a license, that they are affiliated with some sort of [ORGANIZATION] or corrections or ORG1 or something like that, to make sure that they're legal. Because we became homeless again. And they had a 400-pound woman in a closet.",portland
01_30_2019,affordable housing,"That was quickly followed by two more projects in [ORGANIZATION], one in [ORGANIZATION] and the other at FAC0, both containing affordable housing. Yeah. In [LOCATION], we added FAC1 and FAC1 South, and DATE2, we hope to add one to three more commercial new constructions.",portland
01_30_2019,affordable housing,Expanding online permitting to project-managed projects will make the permitting process easier and faster for affordable housing projects that the city finances. and obviously we need to be doing everything we can to expedite these projects. So I'm glad to see [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] engaged in solving that problem.,portland
01_30_2019,homeless; houseless,"So my question [ORGANIZATION] is, as we know, houseless youth of color and [ORGANIZATION] plus youth are disproportionately affected by houselessness in [ORGANIZATION]. In addition to the services we provide that are specific to the [ORGANIZATION] plus youth in the homeless youth continuum, what efforts are being made to provide culturally specific services for black youth and youth of color in the homeless youth continuum? Thank you.",portland
01_30_2019,homeless,"I'll go ahead and take a first swing at that. First of all, just so we don't claim credit for other people's work, [ORGANIZATION] manages the homeless youth continuum, but obviously we're huge supporters of the overall homeless services network through [ORGANIZATION] between the city and the county. Of course, there are significant culturally specific issues.  service providers.",portland
01_30_2019,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], who's sitting behind you, runs the housing services for the mayoral administration. We've been focusing on a couple of very specific projects, [ORGANIZATION], which includes what's called a preference policy designed to ensure that families who were impacted by previous development and gentrification  are at the top of the list in terms of being able to return to the community and take advantage of the affordable housing that's being created by the city of [ORGANIZATION]. And that is largely a community-driven process.",portland
01_20_2016,homeless,"I do think that it would be better if we could more often talk about the hopefully positive revenue impacts, not necessarily through our local controls, but –  Hopefully, like [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] state situation is less clear. This will – in reality, we're talking about some sin taxing, which I'm not in favor of, but we have some expenses we need to face. We have – all these marijuana businesses are going to be opening on streets where homeless people sleep.",portland
01_20_2016,homelessness,"I would hope that when we talk about the nitty-gritty of this regulation, we can also talk about how questionable things like sin taxes can be redeemed into ending homelessness, going beyond just the [ORGANIZATION] shelter and the new peace shelter, and also using some of this revenue to bring truly affordable subsidized housing. Thank you. Thank you very much.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"When I first took office, I asked [PERSON] to reexamine the boundaries, the duration, and the purpose of all of our existing urban renewal areas, 11 of them and six neighborhood prosperity initiative areas. In [ORGANIZATION], I brought to the [ORGANIZATION] proposed amendments to six of these urban renewal areas, and the [ORGANIZATION] then affirmed that direction and asked for more public outreach in a package that does the following, reduces the impact on taxing jurisdictions,  helps [ORGANIZATION] thrive, and provides resources for affordable housing. Those were the three things that we as a council said as we refined and developed this package.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Those are the three things we want to do. Reduce the impacts on the taxing jurisdictions, help [ORGANIZATION], and support affordable housing. Throughout DATE0, we had a committee, and we're going to hear from some of them [TIME], that met to work on this package, and a majority of the committee supported it with only a minor change.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And, in fact, that's already paying dividends to the city and the county and the school district's budgets. It'll increase, this package will increase resources for affordable housing and advance the implementation of our affordable housing goals. And it will help achieve the potential of [ORGANIZATION] and the new [ORGANIZATION] station areas in [LOCATION].",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"As the mayor mentioned and kind of summarized in a nice [STREET], we are here to revisit the direction of  that [ORGANIZATION] provided [ORGANIZATION]. So as the Mayor mentioned, and he highlighted these three specific goals about reducing the impact of urban renewal, supporting [PERSON], and preserving our investments in affordable housing and other development outcomes. And so we're here [LOCATION] to report back on how the proposed changes to their renewal areas deliver on that.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And as you can see, just at a high level, we believe this package delivers on that. So as the mayor mentioned, we have dollars returning to the taxing jurisdictions. You'll see –  in detail the increases in investments in affordable housing in a variety of districts, but also some of the other development outcomes that we're going to be able to achieve with these changes.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"their recommendations and forwarding that to you. And we've also met with [ORGANIZATION]  As I mentioned, we did extensive public outreach. So in addition to convening [ORGANIZATION] and developing recommendations from them, we developed a housing subgroup from that so that we could deal specifically with questions around affordable housing.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"We've obviously had a significant amount of feedback on the objectives around affordable housing, with particular focus on the [ORGANIZATION] urban renewal area. I'll talk about that in a second. And I know there's lots of testimony that you're going to hear later on [ORGANIZATION], and they can shed light on those conversations.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"The district also has some additional needs in that southern end of the district that we believe could use additional public investment. And, of course, we want to continue to invest in affordable housing. So in addition to the expansion of the area, we also want to extend the life of the district by [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And as you'll see in [TIME], this unlocks a substantial pool of resources for us to accomplish a variety of objectives in [ORGANIZATION] that include supporting the growth of [ORGANIZATION], obviously continuing to meet our affordable housing goals, as well as support other commercial development and provide the infrastructure to support that development. Where are the 10 acres that are not currently in the education district, and why are we adding those? So if you look in the map, it's the red.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And then the next table, I just want to once again return everybody to the question of affordable housing. As we mentioned, this was one of the goals of this urban renewal area package. So as you can see, this is a net increase in investment in affordable housing.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"You can see where those funds come from. Obviously, there's a dramatic increase in the affordable housing investment in [ORGANIZATION]  the slight increase in [LOCATION] and us shifting current dollars in the remainder of LOC2 blocks, that offsets the loss of affordable housing investment that would have come from the education renewal area And so you see a total nominal gain of investment of $3.5 million, but because the investments are accelerated, meaning they happen sooner than they would have under the education or renewal area, the present value calculation actually makes it a higher number.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"So we get money for affordable housing sooner. We get more money sooner, and that's why the present value calculation is higher. Do you have similar tables for parks and transportation?",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Additional money is available for open space or other infrastructure needs. It allows us to have the money to invest in growth around [ORGANIZATION], money to support business growth in the area. And then last but not least, we have a significant increase in affordable housing from $9 million under the current projections to $47 million under the amended scenario.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Yeah. So, as I mentioned earlier, as a result of public input, we spent a lot of time refining the plans for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], and we think we have a much better approach to affordable housing as a result. I mentioned the increase in resources.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Lastly, before I know you have a question, we have an affordable housing provision in our development agreement with [ORGANIZATION]. Any other development agreements that are executed within this district would have language around affordable housing as well. A couple of points just for clarification.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"What is the nature of the affordable housing agreement with [ORGANIZATION]? Is that for university plates? So the agreement with [ORGANIZATION], in short, requires them to offer to the city to sell units in any residential housing project that they do, which would most likely be on FAC0.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"but but so so money is set aside for that and then you can see it gives us  some more opportunity to put money to work in supporting businesses and other individual projects, which we know we're going to need some kind of gap financing if we're going to focus on commercial industrial development in that district. And then it does increase the affordable housing numbers from $4 million to $10 million.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And so if you look at historically what's been invested in [ORGANIZATION], I think the picture might look a little different. Can you point me to the [STREET] in this plan where it talks about affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] and particularly in the expansion area? So right now, so we have – so [ORGANIZATION] is actually working on current project in essentially side that will add how many hundred some odd units in essentially side?",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Correct. Yeah. So anyway, so there's a current project that's using up PHP dollars now that  And [ORGANIZATION], assuming that the [PERSON] plan, a comp plan, comes back with us allowing housing to happen there, I think we would work with [ORGANIZATION], with their dollars, as well as I think other incentives we might be able to provide to develop affordable housing within that triangle.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"I think as we've talked about, I think, and essentially side, given that the numbers go from 4 to 10 million, still not a big pot of money, I do think this is a conversation that should also happen within the [ORGANIZATION] conversation. I think we have an opportunity, given the current zoning, to use our tools there to encourage affordable housing development that isn't as heavily subsidized as it is elsewhere because there's a lot of market interest in developing housing. Yeah.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"so i want to ask you a couple questions while you're still in the hot seat and we'll bring you back later um one of the questions was  If we move forward with parcel three and then at some point in [ORGANIZATION], we have a second site identified for affordable housing, what is the current –  framework for deciding the allocation between deeply subsidized units at zero to 30 and other units at 30 to 60, recognizing that when we use [ORGANIZATION], it has to be 60 and below to be eligible under the 30 percent set-aside policy. But what's the mechanism for deciding the next allocation and split between deeply affordable and affordable in any future development?",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,Correct. So that shuts down affordable housing investment as we know it. And the loss to [ORGANIZATION] is $216 million?,portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"One was that we had to find an alternative [STREET] to support the growth and expansion of the university district, which is both good for [ORGANIZATION] and good for the city. And we had to find a [STREET] to compensate for the loss of the set-aside money for affordable housing in an area that was ripe for development. There was a lot of dirt that could be developed.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And I appreciate in that regard that, as [ORGANIZATION] noted, the proposal to expand FAC0 actually accelerates the availability of dollars for affordable housing. So that's not just a sort of a neutral consequence. That actually puts us ahead in the short term in terms of available dollars.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"So overall, I think that this has been achieved in the recommendations before you, which deliver a significant net gain to the taxing jurisdictions while preserving key investment opportunities needed to realize [ORGANIZATION] goals. I particularly want to highlight a few areas relevant to our work at [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] downtown [ORGANIZATION] adjustments and the [PERSON] and affordable housing goals. By many measures, the [ORGANIZATION] has been a success.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,But the struggles present in the [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing conversation are reflective of the issues faced by the city as a whole. And illustrate that affordability and economic diversity in neighborhoods will not be achieved without a robust set of tools and resources coordinated across the city's bureaus. I want to applaud the city's ongoing look at zoning incentives and other tools to further affordability.,portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"We are concerned about the amendments that were in earlier versions of the [ORGANIZATION] report about underdeveloped areas adjacent to FAC0. However, at the time that we were looking at it, it hadn't been identified for affordable housing. We are fine with affordable housing at FAC0.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Other than affordable housing, we would prefer that the investments focus on transportation and infrastructure improvements such as that. The [ORGANIZATION] blocks on FAC0 have long been identified by our board as a priority for important development opportunity to add to the city's tax base. It's a high priority that we have development on the property that contributes to both the employment base of the city as well as the tax base.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Although the [ORGANIZATION] appreciates the consideration staff have devoted to the [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing concerns, we cannot support adoption of the plan amendment until there is more certainty about how the housing goals will be met. More details on the number and affordability of units on the [ORGANIZATION] project,  and secure commitments for sites from each of the major property owners, [PERSON], ORG2, and [PERSON], are needed. The district's DATE0 extension and expansion is critical to their success.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"That should be used as leverage to acquire items that benefit the public, including land for affordable housing and parks. The public is understandably skeptical of the city's commitment to affordable housing and [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0 have passed and only 209 units have been developed.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Long-time observers have seen the city release property owners from their affordable housing obligations in [ORGANIZATION], on [ORGANIZATION]'s FAC0, and with [PERSON] at the FAC1 site. Collectively, they represent close to 1,000 affordable units. The ORG2 recommends that you rebuild community trust by securing commitments for sites from the three major property owners before taking action and provide more details in the plan amendment.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Again, we urge you to withhold approval of the amendment until there are more specifics on parcel 3 and firm commitments for affordable housing sites in the district. Thank you. Thank you.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"We also urge the city not to consider the [ORGANIZATION] planned development to be the fair exchange for urban renewal dollars. Per the development agreement, the [ORGANIZATION] do not have to develop anything unless the market is there. The city should stay firm that the [ORGANIZATION] must commit to affordable housing, parks,  and FAC0 improvements in exchange for urban renewal dollars.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And I want to start by saying, and I apologize for my voice, I'm going to head home soon, but I believe that you are, if not the indispensable person, an indispensable person on this affordable housing piece. And I just want to thank you for service on the committee. Thank you.  for holding our feet to the fire and for the quality of your advocacy.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Our little rump group of the old-timers or the old bats or whatever we call ourselves has not... Speak for yourself. I know, speaking for myself. I am, I am the Scrooge that...  we just don't think this is specific enough there isn't enough agreement as to what will be developed and when it will be developed and we want to see more of that specificity it doesn't sound like it's there on the parks or on the housing and I'm just begging you to reserve this very critical tool  Like it or not, it is a critical tool that the city has to finance affordable housing and use it wisely.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"You could easily spend the money. but that's not the goal the goal is to build housing for lower income people the need to secure land for affordable housing was identified as fundamental to meeting the housing goals in [ORGANIZATION] when this [ORGANIZATION] was established in [LOCATION] when the housing strategy was adopted and several times since it is still literally the foundation of a successful housing strategy yet it has not been done  Most of the infrastructure has been built, thousands of market rate condos and apartments, office, retail, parking garages, hotels. But [ORGANIZATION] there is still only one building with 209 units of affordable housing.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"In DATE0 of the district, this lot was slated to be the centerpiece of the city's affordable housing strategy. In fact, by [LOCATION], the city had invested over $6 million to secure this site for 400 units of affordable housing. No housing has been built there, and the city has now released the owner of the site, [ORGANIZATION], of its obligation to make it affordable for housing.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,Yet it appears that at least $3 million of ORG0 housing funds are still tied up at the site. Thank you. I suggest the city considers entering an agreement with [ORGANIZATION] to build affordable housing there if you do indeed still have a stake in the property.,portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has had the use of city funds for over [ORGANIZATION], and during this period, property values have risen dramatically. Alternatively, [ORGANIZATION] could transfer another suitable site from their extensive holdings in the district.  for affordable housing for its low-income clients and workers. Similarly, PSUs should be required to make the site available for low-income housing.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Allowing the city to buy land for affordable housing is a minimal requirement in exchange for past and future large public expenditures. Alternatively, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] could pay to complete FAC0 and the other public infrastructures as developers must do in ORG2 projects. The city could then use this money for affordable housing and parks.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And I think when I am with people from out of town visiting there,  They're astonished that they can't pick out the affordable housing in that neighborhood. It looks every bit as nice as the market rate rental apartments and condos. So that happened because we built those affordable properties early while the land prices were low, and the city held the developer to explicit standards.",portland
02_26_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"the development period rather than at the front When everything was going to be more expensive and that was with the understandable rationale that [ORGANIZATION] producing projects had to be done first But secondly sites were not acquired while the land was cheap. I don't know how many meetings I went to where staff reported to us that they'd turned down a possible acquisition because the owner wanted too much money for it and then the prices would continue to escalate of course and  And finally, affordable housing is not required in the specific development agreements with property owners early on in the process. So as a result, we have nearly 3,000  very handsome condominium units and luxury apartments that have been built, but not a single unit of affordable housing until we began, until [ORGANIZATION] had passed, and only that sole project, I believe, was approved because it would provide housing for homeless veterans during a time of war.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And now we have a chance to get some additional money, but I just want to point out that  As [ORGANIZATION] explained with the reconfigured urban renewal districts, the net gain for affordable housing across all districts is only $3.5 million, $3.5 million, which is 10% of what's been spent to date  in [ORGANIZATION] to get one single project accomplished. So it's a very small amount of money. It's $48 million in [ORGANIZATION], but that's because we're taking money out of the education district and other districts.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"We were supposed to get 400 units of affordable housing out of that. I think we need to go back and say, how do we somehow make up for that? It's not necessarily that same plan of parking underneath and housing above, but we need to do something to make up for what we lost when that agreement was allowed to go away.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,I assume you like that split. I very much appreciate the work that [ORGANIZATION] and his team have done to increase the resources for affordable housing in the district. I think it's important to keep the net amount in mind.,portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"You have reminded us that as we continue to expand housing units in the district, that the denominator gets bigger. So the numerator has to get bigger. So it's the affordable housing goals are not static.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"They grow over time because we have to look at the income profile of the city and we have to constantly adjust based on the number of units that are built generally. You've said, you've reminded us that our affordable housing goals that were set once upon a time assumed a certain number of overall units, and as the district gets more units, we have to add more affordable housing units to maintain the right proportion. Well, if I may, it's not quite that, because when that deal was cut in [ORGANIZATION], the constrained funding system  said we're going to cut our goals back by 64 percent until we reach 3,000, then we're going to go back to the matching city income profile.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And this is not a competition of parks, infrastructure, and housing, because we believe that if  a good diverse neighborhood should have parks. And so we think you ought to do parks and affordable housing. The real question is, what is the priority down there, and how do you spend that money and when?",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"We heard that's a tough issue, and that's a barrier to affordable housing, and we support getting more operating dollars. [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] development, we strongly support affordable housing in that development. And a question that we had and a discussion we had was if this was an inclusionary zoning, which we support, we've testified for, we've said we're putting in the comp plan, we've done everything to try to get it for [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] would support  pay or build affordable housing.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"However, in the [ORGANIZATION] district, the city has to pay to do affordable housing, and not sure why that is. Unless, of course, he chose just to do commercial buildings. Unless he chose to do just commercial buildings.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,And it doesn't have the money we think for affordable housing either to reach the number. So that's the change in looking at that 30% to 70% allocation. You have to change that number or you just don't have enough money when you look at the budget.,portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"I expect that [ORGANIZATION] has concerns, but I'm certain that [ORGANIZATION] is willing to work with the city in getting a temporary greenway built. This is not only important for the residents, but it is an incentive for workers and employers and everyone soon to be taking advantage of FAC0. What I would also like to say is, as a representative of ORG2, we are also very supportive of affordable housing.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,So it's not that we're looking for transportation or affordable housing. We're looking for both. Thank you very much.,portland
02_26_2015,housing crisis,"In [ORGANIZATION], we had a countywide shortage of 10,000 units for households at 30% of median income or less. Fast forward [LOCATION] to DATE2, and our shortage countywide is 23,245 units. We have a severe housing crisis, and the poorest of the poor are the ones in greatest jeopardy.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And I think we all understand the need. So what are we going to do about it?  Identifying FAC0 as a site for affordable housing is a terrific first step. We've been told there can be 400 units on the site, and we're looking at one building of 200 units.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"As you know, [ORGANIZATION] manages the one affordable housing project in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and thank you, [ORGANIZATION], for that story. And I'll just offer one other example of how affordable housing gives back to the community. One resident at [ORGANIZATION] is also a board member at [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_26_2015,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION], which shelters or houses approximately 350 homeless families [TIME]. This is about 1,100 homeless people, about 600 homeless kids, and about 500 homeless parents.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"I also serve on [ORGANIZATION], although I'm certainly not speaking for the commission DATE0. But I think that when [ORGANIZATION] meets [LOCATION] and we talk about these issues, I'd like to offer that [ORGANIZATION] do the monitoring on the progress of how many affordable units we have produced once we agree on a goal. According to an analysis completed by [ORGANIZATION], in [ORGANIZATION], there's at least 23,000 affordable housing units that are in deficit, which would mean that these are units that are needed for the lowest income renders but are not available.",portland
02_26_2015,homeless,"For us, this deficit means that although homeless families have vouchers to be able to get out of the shelter or get out of the situation of being homeless, they're not able to find apartments or apartment owners that will rent to them. As a result, they are stuck in the shelter or they're doubled up with family and friends, sometimes in unsafe situations. I'd like to ask you to imagine yourself as the parent in a homeless family, and you have several homeless children with you, and you finally, finally, finally get yourself out of the emergency shelter by having a voucher that you can take to a landlord, and it'll pay for [ORGANIZATION] worth of rent, and you go to apartment after apartment after apartment, and no one will rent to you.",portland
02_26_2015,homeless,"And then someone asks you, how many units should they build in [ORGANIZATION], 62 or 200 or 400? And  If you were that homeless parent, you wouldn't say 62, I don't think. For every 100 extremely low income renters, there's only 21 affordable rental units for them to rent.",portland
02_26_2015,homeless,"For [ORGANIZATION], we have 700 units. Our vacancy rate is 1 percent, which means we have seven vacant units at any time, and they're only vacant for as long as it takes to turn over the unit and the next family moves in. As you know, being homeless is harmful both short-term and long-term to parents as well as to children.",portland
02_26_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"Children have a very hard time keeping up in school if they're homeless. Parents can't keep jobs if they're homeless. But this lack of affordable housing and the 23,000 deficit in affordable housing units is what keeps these families being homeless.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Part of the solution, of course, is to build more affordable housing. I would just like to ask you in summary to think about whether or not we have enough affordable housing for all of our citizens, whether or not we can purchase land now to make it more cost effective, and if we can identify strategies to build housing for very low-income people and write that into the plan so that we're certain that it would happen. Thank you.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,I'm PERSON0. I'm executive director of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] is a statewide association that advocates for affordable housing groups.,portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"percent MFI. And so I know recently we had an issue in northeast [ORGANIZATION] where there was an affordable housing imbalance and Mayor [PERSON], you made a bold move and dedicated $20 million to meet that need. We see that this is a good opportunity for perhaps another bold move such as that to try to meet these goals.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Also, in the central east side [ORGANIZATION], there should be language to ensure that there's a firm commitment to securing affordable housing in [LOCATION] or on other sites. So there are many developers and owners here that are ready to jump in. We know that there's not enough money, and right now we're trying to solve it with [ORGANIZATION] funds.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And again, if we wait [ORGANIZATION], let's say it takes [ORGANIZATION] to conclude a negotiation or more, we can't compel that negotiation. Are we prepared to hold that negotiation?  hostage, in effect, to a development agreement that may not happen where we have the money to move forward on a substantial down payment of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. I didn't realize there was a tie between the ORG0 development agreement and [ORGANIZATION].",portland

And I understand the dilemma, and I think there's a [STREET] to have both. Okay.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"But the vast majority of the housing need is for people in low and moderate incomes. And if this process in [ORGANIZATION] is any example to us of how it's going to go, that need is not going to get met. Without strategies for preserving a real diversity of housing in our older neighborhoods, you won't even be able to build sufficient affordable housing in the central city to offset those losses, never mind increase the supply.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,We can't do what needs to be done for this city around the affordable housing strategy simply by investing public dollars. That's going to have to be a necessary part of the strategy. It cannot be all of it.,portland

02_26_2015,homelessness,"And we did help [ORGANIZATION] work very closely with the city of [PERSON] on a [ORGANIZATION] plan to end homelessness. I'm really here just to say that I'm wanting to support this group of housing advocates who bring this amazing institutional memory to these efforts to try to create real housing opportunities for people. A lot's happened in [LOCATION], but I think we could all agree that we haven't come even close to meeting the progress we know is necessary to meet the needs of  and it has now become imperative.",portland

02_26_2015,affordable housing,"Well, the whole scheme here is I was living in affordable housing as a person with a disability and I had a job. And my non-profit affordable housing landlord filed a [ORGANIZATION] no-cause and destroyed $20,000 worth of my property.",portland
02_26_2015,homeless,"That left me broke, sick, and homeless. And now, taxpayers are paying for me to be in [ORGANIZATION]-subsidized housing. I'm the metric equivalent of that dog that you all are using to do your metric equivalent of importing hashish.",portland
02_26_2015,homeless; affordable housing,"You're taking the federal money. This is all about taking federal money, building...  transit infrastructure, and taking federal money.

02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And in the discussions on [ORGANIZATION], of which I was on the [ORGANIZATION] member, it was a top priority for this district to have the [ORGANIZATION] completed. [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION] have been promised, but underfunded in the past, and [ORGANIZATION] their full funding continues to be vague and on the back end. We need both affordable housing and the parks and [ORGANIZATION] to become a priority.",portland
02_26_2015,houseless,"um i i think that there's different motivations that folks have for talking to you guys um with all due respect you know a property developer is is motivated on profit you know these housing advocates they're motivated for protecting [ORGANIZATION]'s uh houseless and under house citizens and the integrity of our city you know um  I went to a thing called [ORGANIZATION] last night. There was about 20 of us. And what we were talking about was specifically how the rents are increasing in  you know, while our incomes aren't matching those increases.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"we've got to hold their feet to the fire. You know, we have to find ways to be very specific about where this money goes and how much of it gets dedicated, you know, to the affordable housing. And we have to follow through on it.",portland

And somehow it doesn't happen. You know, meanwhile, these developers, they have no horse in this game.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"So we need to think about housing people who are making what we realistically do make, which is 35%, 40%. Some people make 20% of that number. So I think that a very key thing to talk about with affordable housing is what is affordable.",portland
02_26_2015,homeless,"and no green spaces, no parks, as the lady has pointed out, or minimal. And then my friend PERSON0 talks about MFI, medium family income, and Mr. [PERSON] was just up here, and he's worked with various nonprofits that take their clients and they code them into a computer where the clients get a barcode on a plastic card, not on their body. That's for HMIS, probably some federal contract, [ORGANIZATION],  except the last three letters are a lie.",portland

There might be information, but we have people, we don't ever have a clear, coherent discussion at [ORGANIZATION] or here about exactly how many people are never, ever going to have an income above $790 or whatever the latest ORG1 adjustment is, and that we absolutely have to have information  an equal, exactly equal number of units for those people as people are that are getting ORG1 checks.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"That information is out there, but we never seem to pair up that information. And then we have the issue of the working poor, as [ORGANIZATION] has raised, people who really don't have any rational connection through their pocketbook to median family income and poverty level. And every time we have these conversations, I realize we're primarily talking about urban renewal, but essentially we're using part of our urban renewal strategy is  to find more affordable housing units.",portland
02_26_2015,homeless,"But we never set, we never talk specifically about the data of how many people are under there and that if developers want to make any profit on real estate, they have to find a [STREET] to fill that need. If they can't fill that need, they can't have any assistance and we need to have publicly owned and managed properties, understand their federal obstructions to getting new northwest towers and new home forward owned properties.  let them sue us if we try and house our homeless. We need to get 3,[ADDRESS] and in sanitary safe housing.",portland
02_26_2015,affordable housing,"And we're not going to have any more magic money flowing in for [ORGANIZATION]. So we need to be figuring out how are we going to provide the parks, and if not on FAC0, then where else could a park be that's going to need money for acquisition as well as development? How are we going to get the FAC1 effect  finished, which we don't currently have that money in the parks budget, and how are we going to do the necessary transportation improvements, as well as how are we going to get at least 270 units of very affordable housing and hopefully to 400.",portland

02_18_2016,houseless,"Tents would range in size from one- to two-person tents to up to ten-person tents. structures with approximately 2,100 square feet of net building area containing restrooms, showers, laundry facilities, a kitchen, and storage for personal belongings would be provided. Other houseless individuals who are not sheltered at the rest area may also use some of the facilities, as Commissioner [PERSON] said.",portland
02_18_2016,houseless,It provides shelter and stability. There are no membership requirements. Amenities at the site would be available to other houseless individuals as well as those who take shelter at the site.,portland

So we are in solidarity with many organizations, including the Homeless Bill of Rights,  [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, ORG3ORG4ORG5, ORG6, ORG7, which is a selfORG4defense class that happens once a month, [ORGANIZATION], ORG9, [PERSON]0, [PERSON]1, and other camps like FAC0 and [PERSON]2, which is going trying to be established out in southeast, outer southeast.",portland
02_18_2016,houseless,"Sure. We have pregnant women who have came through the rest area, and we referred them to midwives instead of sending them to the hospital where the question is asked if they're houseless or not, and that causes them to lose their children because they –  are required to report to the state that an individual is houseless so if i can just follow up that was my question so there are absolutely no children living at right to dream too that is correct anyone under [ORGANIZATION] is not allowed and that rule will apply to the new location as well yes it will okay thank you",portland
02_18_2016,houseless,"So when you look at it from the [STREET], what you see is that these houseless people are actually doing things like trying to support, um, distressed [ORGANIZATION] populations by providing pollinator habitat, um,  through their sculptural door wall that they'll be bringing over from their [ORGANIZATION] location. They'll be creating a beautiful edge that is lovely to look at and makes a statement about community. And when you arrive at the site, there will be a gateway which announces that you've arrived at something of a village of people that is a cultural space, so it'll be a lovely thing, and it'll speak to the [STREET] like the best kind of architecture must do in the urban city.  in the urban core.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,The land therefore should remain in a permitted use for which it was originally intended transportation. The existing right-of-[STREET] serves as viable access to emergency vehicles needed to direct access to the adjacent sites.

02_18_2016,homelessness,"in his comments. I won't repeat them. And furthermore, we had some real frustrations about the public process surrounding the proposal, as well as the city's history of the phenomenon of homelessness is addressed.",portland
02_18_2016,homelessness,"The fact that people are sleeping on the streets embodies a complex and many-faceted problem, and many of us already know a lot of the factors, so I'm going to kind of skip ahead in my notes. But I do want to comment that it's a difficult  to find a job and maintain employment if one has no address, no [STREET] to shower before an interview, and if one must carry all one's belongings to the interview, and if there is no [STREET] for [TIME]'s sleep and adequate assistance with medications and other means of managing chronic illnesses, be they mental health or addiction or those of a more physical, physiological nature, it's difficult to keep a job. We can talk about homelessness, ending homelessness, that's a dream.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"so maintaining public process is critical we would ask and I would ask that the city continue their efforts to support right to dream to continue the efforts to work with the homeless and I've had to skip part of this and so I'm lost my [STREET]  In closing, let me say that we spent, and I spent, time over the course of [ORGANIZATION] and in DATE1 DATE2 working with [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"We started this process by defining what ORG0 meant. And what we decided that meant as a group was that people are legally able to sleep there, that there are access to bathrooms, that there are clean facilities, that there is the ability to have heat or warmth, that there is oversight or support by people trained to support physical safety, that there is dry or overhead shelter, including tents or tarps, and that there is lighting designed to assure adequate safety. We specifically discussed a variety of options, acknowledging that the needs of the people sleeping outside our homeless neighbors are just as diverse as the needs of the housed population.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"and for people of color in our community who we know are disproportionately represented among the homeless population. Facility-based shelter is not the only option, and it can't be the only option that we offer. These sites serve large numbers of people.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"Yeah, and speaking of field, let me reiterate Commissioner [PERSON]'s suggestion that we get to public testimony. And there's no doubt going to be a need for council discussion about how this fits into our overall programmatic effort. But I guess I also want to remind the council, and you can ponder this while we –  deliberate later on this, and that is Commissioner [PERSON] is in the process of leading a process by which our homeless services staff are transferred to [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"So this is a rest area, not a housing project. We will be in the housing project development business and [ORGANIZATION] will be in the homeless services business of the transition that Commissioner [PERSON] is leading  goes forward. And so I think it would certainly be appropriate for us to discuss with [ORGANIZATION] how this particular homeless service facility will be supported by local government.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"I'm speaking as an individual [ORGANIZATION]. To illustrate my concerns, I'm going to tell you a short story. Within [PERSON], homeless people broke into four vintage railroad passenger cars that were stored in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON].",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"Since FAC0 will be a sanctioned camp on city property and since the camp will likely attract other homeless people to the area,  What liability will the city take on to help protect the irreplaceable rail equipment, historic rail equipment, that is on the nearby museum property?

02_18_2016,homeless,"What I'm here to do is just tell you the truth about the matter of moving [PERSON]. When [PERSON] established itself [ORGANIZATION], if [ORGANIZATION] city government had the right attitude toward homeless, why that property owner would have been showered with praise for having provided [PERSON] with a [STREET] to do its healing of the community. On the contrary, the city government socked that property owner with $5,000 fee for his civic activity.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"We're moving FAC0. It's a big deal to move FAC0 because we don't want the downtown area of our city to have a homeless camp in it.

02_18_2016,homeless,"I'm [PERSON], property owner in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm here not to discuss the inappropriateness of legalized camping in the city, but to rather propose solid alternatives that eliminate the need for the city to authorize camping.

02_18_2016,homeless,Is it humane to see some homeless person going through the garbage can to get their next meal or panhandling to get a couple bucks to go up to [ORGANIZATION] and order off the value menu? i mean this is you know i may have a warped sense of what humane is but that ain't it and as far as you know the guys from ORG1 i've worked in a company for [ORGANIZATION] that had uh or does have a anodizing line that anodized [ADDRESS] I do support the move you know,portland
02_18_2016,affordable housing,"I'm chairperson of [ORGANIZATION], former board member of [ORGANIZATION], and helped to establish the model that we have now. It astounds me that we have been at FAC0 and FAC1 since [ORGANIZATION]. We've been in chambers [LOCATION], sometimes DATE2, discussing [ORGANIZATION] and the need for more [ORGANIZATION]s and the need for more low-impact, low-barrier, affordable housing units.",portland
02_18_2016,houseless,"And...  No, FAC0 and FAC1 is not the ideal spot, but that is the location that is on the table for us. And no, we will not be bringing more houseless people into the [ORGANIZATION]. They're already there.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,I got an amputated leg because I was homeless on your streets. I went to your dim city. You know what?,portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"We work with cannabis people there. I go DATE0 DATE1 in a row. I don't see these clowns out there feeding the homeless, but I was out there in my wheelchair feeding them food, putting shirts on their backs.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"and I'm homeless and I don't care now. I want you, Mayor, to call the president up and ask for the same thing [ORGANIZATION] did.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"I'm PERSON0. I want to thank [ORGANIZATION] for saving my marriage, saving my life. I was [ORGANIZATION], I was homeless [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON], my sister-in-law brought me up to [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_18_2016,homelessness,"And they took us off the streets, and they showed me what homelessness was all about. They helped me get off drugs. Yeah, so that's why I'm here.",portland
02_18_2016,houseless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], co-founder of [ORGANIZATION], founder of [ORGANIZATION], and co-founder of ORG2, too. I've been in the houseless community in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], for [ORGANIZATION]. And I always face these adversities with people speaking on what things they don't know and of fear.",portland
02_18_2016,houseless,"And if they did their homework, they would know that FAC0 is a houseless community, but it's a houseless community where people come and  and try to get back into the mainstream of things. And we figured out the first thing that a helpless person needs is rest. And that's why we call it a rest area where people come get rest.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,Why are you playing like you're concerned about us not? You didn't come help us out. I was an aerospace technician and quit my job to help the homeless community out.,portland
02_18_2016,houseless,"What are you all doing to help us out by trying to ridicule us and say how bad and nasty and ugly we are, which we should be afraid of you all because we're doing the things  that we need to do to become productive while you keep putting those negativities on us. We ask the city for no penny. We've been operating [ORGANIZATION], too, by teaching the houseless community how to write grants, how to do public speaking.",portland
02_18_2016,houseless,"We can train the people how to be flaggers for the trucks that come in. We have people in the community that did all kinds of things in their life, even truck drivers. That's two spoken here, and they know how it is.  to [STREET] trucks and you're talking about people with experience, again, that's that negative thought that shows me you don't know what you're talking about because everybody in the houseless community was something before they became houseless.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"Give her a hand there. Thank you. Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm a homeless advocate, also co-founder of [ORGANIZATION] and a board member.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"The mayor, we had a conversation when you had this emergency for the homeless, and my comment to you was –  The working homeless people are asking why are they rewarding homeless people that have vices, drugs, alcohol, mentally ill, with housing? Where's my housing at? A lot of these homeless individuals are like that.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"So I was considered a chronically homeless person. People consider somebody like me that's been out there for [ORGANIZATION], oh, well, he likes it out there. That's why he's doing that.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"He doesn't want this. It wasn't that. It was just that I wasn't going to play that system and say, look, yeah, everybody, every homeless person is on drugs and alcohol.",portland
02_18_2016,affordable housing,"Well, Right to Dream [ADDRESS] until there's enough affordable housing for everybody. It's not a permanent solution. This is what's happening right now is what we're talking about and what I believe [PERSON] was talking about, getting people together.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"That is my goal, and that's what I would like, people to get together and understand that not every homeless person is on drugs, alcohol, mentally ill. When you talk about mentally ill, also, you're talking about sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is when homeless people don't get that chance to sleep at [TIME] because of the sweeps.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"Now, they're walking around like zombies. They don't make good decisions. And when they react to that kind of stuff, then people start pointing their finger and saying, oh, look, that homeless person's on drugs.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"Oh, look, that homeless person is mentally ill. No, sleep deprivation, it's big out there. And this is why it's needed, right, to train too.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless; affordable housing,We need to start... Putting more stuff on out there other than affordable housing ways of getting homeless people inside a safe secure [STREET] So thank you for this. Thank you.,portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"I'm talking about the community that is the right to dream to and the city's plan to uproot it and move it to a [STREET] that is further from social services.  further from their community and from all outward appearances, is in the corner of [ORGANIZATION]. Currently located at FAC0 and FAC1, there are many crucial services within only a [TIME] walk. You have [ORGANIZATION], which...  addresses changing needs of the homeless and low-income youth.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,I would ask that you actually incorporate that into this agreement to give protections to this simple nonprofit working on a shoestring. I appreciate your work. I've worked with homeless people since [ORGANIZATION].,portland
02_18_2016,homeless; homelessness,"So I'm [PERSON] with [ORGANIZATION] and also founding member of  GPE0 Cop Watch. I just wanted to say that R2D2 reduces crime, reduces homelessness, and is a service to the community in ways that no other city agency or county agency or other community agencies have provided. And I not only endorse them getting this spot, I endorse them getting 10, 20 more spots since they've shown themselves to be such a  Great organization that actually does put a serious dent in the homeless problem.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"And, you know, there's a lot of different people here that have argued all this various stuff about city codes and all this other stuff. Well, you want to know what? The homeless state of emergency overrides all these various city codes in a lot of ways.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"So all you yuppies are just going to have to deal with the new deal and realize that the city is finally going to do a few things for homeless people. So you guys just need to shut up and do something yourself or come with some better plan since no one else has stepped up other than [ORGANIZATION]. And, you know, this is all about human survival, and all these [ORGANIZATION] arguments are just, you know, I don't know.",portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"I can't even believe some of the stuff I've heard here [ORGANIZATION]. And this guy is talking about apartheid. [PERSON], homeless apartheid, is a huge reality everywhere.",portland

02_18_2016,homelessness,We couldn't agree more that we as a community need to be doing more to help those experiencing homelessness on our streets. So we very much agree about that. I will limit my comments.,portland
02_18_2016,homeless,and we're still working on there do you have a thought on that it it's still a draft i think that can be determined you're the mayor do you have a view as to who should who should have oversight of this this particular development um you mean who on the city side well this is an agreement between the city and a non-profit we have uh FAC0 is overseen by [ORGANIZATION]  You said earlier that you are interested in moving the homeless services of the city to the county.,portland
02_18_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], Mayor, has never managed a homeless housing or camp or program, to my knowledge, and we do. I appreciate the flexibility that we are operating under, but we do have a housing bureau. Well, we have an agreement with a nonprofit organization in the case of this property.",portland
02_01_2018,affordable housing,"DATE0 addressing several equity concerns of the LTIC charge through changes in code. And I believe in your exhibits, the highlighted sections are the ones that we added since [LOCATION]. The first code and rule update is an owner-occupied low-income exemption to complement the affordable housing exemption under consideration.",portland
02_01_2018,homeless,"We tried to anticipate hardships when we first set the program up in [ORGANIZATION], so we carefully crafted language that anticipated a fire damage situation. A fire occurred, somebody needed to spend some time dealing with an insurance company to get funds secured to replace that structure, so we created a [LOCATION] exemption program  that if you're homeless, damaged due to fire, and you're replacing it, we wouldn't come in and charge this program. We're trying to expand that to a hardship, those cases that we don't know what might come at us, but set a system in [STREET] where somebody can make a hardship case come before the committee and have that evaluated.",portland
02_01_2018,affordable housing,"So I came at this particular issue, asbestos and lead, in demolitions from three different places. One is I share half of his constituents, and I was hearing a lot about this,  Two, I am the chair of [ORGANIZATION], and so I was certainly hearing about demolitions, often from people who are very upset about demolitions and wanted to make sure that we're preserving our stock of affordable housing. So I do want to say on that note that I want to thank you for the city's support.  of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] [DATE] coming up in the legislature to increase the document recording fee that goes to affordable housing.",portland
02_01_2018,affordable housing,"Some of that is geared toward home ownership, and some of those home ownership dollars are used not only to help people with down payments and financial education,  but also for home repairs. And so the more that we can get money into home repairs so that people don't feel forced out of the affordable housing they have because they have a leaky roof or something like that is really important. On the other hand, I'm very supportive of demolitions when it makes [STREET] for more multifamily affordable housing.",portland
02_01_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"So we've gone from a housing crisis to a housing glut with units going vacant and a lot of people really wishing for those cheaper, well-built houses that were put in the landfill. Coming back to this topic, hopefully we will see the fertility, the expense, and unnecessary loss involved in demolitions and stop them altogether. Keeping our viable, affordable housing and building only on vacant land.",portland
01_06_2016,homelessness,"We're leveraging your investment in a number of ways in a public-private partnership, but also allowing us to address issues like housing and homelessness with kids that may end up in that [STREET] if we don't break the cycle of poverty. And we know that for every kid we can keep out of poverty over five generations, roughly 200 of their descendants will also be affected. So the leverage we're creating is tremendous.",portland
01_06_2016,homeless,"Appreciate it. Okay, let's take item number four, please. Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless suite, homeless state of emergency.",portland
01_06_2016,homeless,"And I think that's conflicting with the homeless state of emergency. So I don't know how you guys are going to handle this, but you need to...  you know, cancel your contracts or alter them. And so homeless people aren't getting swept through these old existing contracts.",portland
01_06_2016,homeless,"And also, you know, everyone's all patting you guys on the back for letting one more city-sanctioned homeless camp stay at [ORGANIZATION], which is, you know, only has a capacity of 40 people. You know, that's hardly worth a big amount of praise if –  that's all you've done in [ORGANIZATION] of your office when you've basically overpriced the city for a lot of people. And, uh,  So it's hardly making a dent.",portland
01_06_2016,homeless,"I hope you'll start opening at least five or ten more city-sanctioned homeless camps and actually really make a dent instead of a minor league little dent. And also the [ORGANIZATION] situation, I saw it actually expand city land, and you guys get [ORGANIZATION] land, and then it expands your police powers to evict the homeless campers.  that aren't on the [ORGANIZATION] turf. And basically, the [ORGANIZATION] camp is already on city land, so I kind of see it as a legal [ORGANIZATION] land grab to expand police powers.",portland
01_06_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And there's a lot of different things you could do to actually change the situation with homelessness. There's a thing called hot teams in other cities where they send out...  homeless outreach teams with various agencies when they go out with the police and, um,  have contact with homeless people, and they offer them services and other stuff. And by people constantly being swept around, it really makes it hard for service agencies to actually go provide services to the homeless people when they can't even find the people they're trying to service.",portland
01_06_2016,homeless,"And there's another thing also. If you guys are going to have the police do a lot of outreach...  and contact with homeless people all the time, you might want to train them too in actually knowing how to navigate the social services of our city because they give out these little green pamphlets that have about nine addresses on it, and that's about all they do. And, you know, if you actually get some people to train them,  You know, so they actually know the various services and how...",portland

01_06_2016,housing crisis,"So we were happy to see that the council committed 50% of [ORGANIZATION] budget surplus to infrastructure maintenance, and we urge you to commit to do the same for [LOCATION]. Now, we realize that the city has other urgent priorities, like the housing crisis,  But we think that committing 50% of surpluses to maintenance is important for a couple reasons. First, it's fiscally prudent.",portland
01_06_2016,houseless,It's actually not just an issue for during track down time. It's something we actually need to be mindful of.  all the time as we deal with our houseless situation and the many people that sleep along FAC0. That's right.,portland
02_21_2019,homelessness; housing crisis; affordable housing,"Colleagues, steep rent increases, very low vacancy rates, and housing demand that far outpaces supply precipitated an affordable housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION]. To address the tremendous suffering of unsheltered people and households on the brink of homelessness, [ORGANIZATION] declared a homelessness state of emergency back in [ORGANIZATION]. We're still very much in this state of emergency and continue to work in multiple ways to mitigate emergency conditions.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"I know the crowd. So you can add emergency language from – Thank you. We just need to declare a reason why the emergency exists, and then we can –  The reason for the emergency clause, and just to be clear, the purpose of the clause is so that the ordinance takes effect immediately after passage as opposed to [ORGANIZATION] after the second reading, given that this is a very important issue.  given that the passage of this ordinance immediately will allow us to continue the flexibility that's provided for the expedited permitting of affordable housing, that this gives us the flexibility we need in the community to site both emergency shelter and alternative shelter, and given that this allows us to continue to site storage facilities,  What do you call them?",portland
02_21_2019,homeless,"Colleagues, we will now hear from our panel, [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION], PERSON1 from ORG1, and PERSON2 from ORG2, and PERSON3 from ORG3. Good [TIME]. Thanks for being here.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] first established a housing state of emergency. This declaration of emergency gave the city expanded authority, as the mayor has said, to site day storage units, expeditiously issue permits for shelter and alternative shelters, and in [LOCATION], established an expedited design review process for new affordable housing developments.",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness,"When the city first declared the emergency, we were experiencing some of the highest rent increases in the nation, coupled with an extremely low vacancy rate for housing, which unsurprisingly increased the number of people experiencing homelessness and needing shelter and permanent housing. In the intervening time, while rent growth has slowed and vacancy rates have increased, we have simultaneously doubled the number of people we are assisting with shelter and permanent housing, though the need in our community persists, and the need to continue the powers we were granted under the Declaration of Emergency continue. As a result of the emergency, the city's increased funding for housing and homelessness created new policies and programs to help us solve the crisis.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"Since the time of the declaration, we have stepped up our investments in both housing and services. DATE0, we opened 800 new units of permanently affordable housing, providing stable quality homes throughout our community for more than 1,800 people. And [PERSON], we expect to open the doors to 1,000 more new units.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"Since the initial declaration, the city has adopted a comprehensive inclusionary zoning program, ensuring that new developments are part of the solution to the crisis, not contributing to the problem. By requiring all the new developments, over 20 units include affordable housing. As a result, we already have over 362 units in process or in operation [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_21_2019,homeless,I'd now like to turn it over to [ORGANIZATION] who's joining us from [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you. Greeting Mayor and Council Members.,portland
02_21_2019,homeless,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the new Equity Manager for [ORGANIZATION]. I've actually been in the role for [ORGANIZATION] now.,portland
02_21_2019,homeless,So this is my first large public meeting. I'm here [ORGANIZATION] on behalf of our Director [PERSON] and our Deputy Director [PERSON] who are both unfortunately not able to attend and are out of town. [ORGANIZATION] is very supportive of the proposal before you to extend the state of emergency for [LOCATION].,portland
02_21_2019,homeless,"As [ORGANIZATION] pointed out, underneath the state of emergency, the city and the county have significantly increased investments in homeless services. And with these investments, we've been able to respond to the crisis in unprecedented ways. As tens of thousands of people have lost their homes, we've been able to respond by dramatically increasing our prevention, housing placement, and sheltering efforts.",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness,"And I meant to say housing, as tens of thousands of people have lost their housing. As you can see here, since [ORGANIZATION], we've nearly doubled from just under 3,000 to nearly 6,000 people per year who we are helping escape homelessness through placement into permanent housing. During the same period of time, we've more than doubled from 4,000 to over 8,000 the number of people served in emergency shelter [LOCATION].",portland
02_21_2019,homeless,"In addition to expanding investments in overall system capacity, [ORGANIZATION] has used the state of emergency to expand the number of emergency shelters in our community at the fastest rate in [ORGANIZATION]. We have used the declaration of the state of emergency to help us open more than 650 new beds of [LOCATION] shelter for men, women, couples, families with children, veterans, and domestic violence survivors. We've distributed those shelters geographically, and we've removed the barriers that traditionally kept many of the most vulnerable people out of our shelters.",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness,"We've also used the state of emergency to launch new alternative shelter, [ORGANIZATION], to help relocate [PERSON] and to begin the process of relocating [ORGANIZATION]. That work has led to more than doubling the number of people who have access to shelter [ORGANIZATION] in our community. And it helped lead to a reduction in unsheltered homelessness and a reduction in unsheltered chronic homelessness [DATE].",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness,"It focuses on finding permanent solutions for individuals and families who've experienced chronic homelessness and provides them with affordable quality housing and services they need to be successful in their housing and in the community. Within DATE0 of operation, we already have brought on 162 new units of supportive housing and have [DATE] of our goal in progress or planned. We also are bringing innovative solutions to our work with new funding from the state, county, and city to create low-cost innovative models, including 78 new units we recently announced and two new developments with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_21_2019,homeless,"Good [TIME], Mayor [PERSON], Commissioners. My name is [PERSON]. I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness,I'd like to take just a moment to thank you all for your commitment and the work that you have done over [ORGANIZATION] to help people who are experiencing homelessness and to serve the most needy in our community. And I appreciate you considering this resolution [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] urges you to extend the state of emergency.,portland
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness,"The flexibility that it allows has been invaluable to homeless providers around the region. One of the best examples of this is our FAC0, which you're likely familiar with. It provides safe sleeping pods with a locking door for women who have experienced long-term homelessness.",portland
02_21_2019,homeless,"Some women have been homeless for [ORGANIZATION] and do not feel safe in shelters before they come into FAC0. We have placed 21 of these women into permanent housing over [LOCATION]. And I'm pleased to tell you the last three women from our original site have all been accepted into housing and will be moving into permanent housing in DATE2, which will bring our number up to 24.",portland
02_21_2019,homeless,"We just announced it [TIME]. We're quite excited about it. And when we had our national site visit, we talked to them at length about the flexibility that we had received through the state of emergency, the work that we've done with the city and the county and the joint office and with all our homeless service providers.",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness,"Prior to managing FAC0, I've also had the opportunity to work at almost every shelter authorized under the state of emergency. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], FAC1, [PERSON], FAC2, and now FAC0. Each night I see firsthand the value of shelter services for folks struggling to regain stability and their homelessness and move forward with their lives.",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"I'm therefore here [ORGANIZATION] to urge that the state of emergency be extended so that our community can further strengthen our shelter services and ensure that they link up more efficiently to the one thing that truly ends someone's homelessness, housing, affordable housing. Over DATE1, the state of emergency has allowed transition projects to significantly expand emergency shelter options in our community. And at present, more than 700 men, women, and couples shelter with us [TIME] across our eight different locations.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"They're filled with people who need deeply affordable housing, and many also need wraparound support services to be successful in that housing to begin with. So along those lines, [ORGANIZATION] is proud to be working with [PERSON], ORG2, and ORG3 to help develop [LOCATION], the low-income single adult housing project that will bring 72 units of innovative, deeply affordable housing to the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood in [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION]. The continuation of the state of emergency is critical to ensuring that affordable housing developments like FAC0 move through the system as quickly as possible, and that we are able to make progress on this community's commitment to permanent supportive housing.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"We have recently taken over the operations at [ORGANIZATION], which is 50 units of supported housing for veterans in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. We were also just awarded funding by [ORGANIZATION] to develop a new affordable housing project, which includes a mixture of one-bedroom apartments and [ORGANIZATION] units on a piece of church land that will focus on housing and supporting veterans. While we've made a lot of progress serving veterans in our community,  ORG1 shelters operate with a wait list because we're full [TIME].",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"And there are more than 400 veterans in the city of [ORGANIZATION] who we know are in need of permanent housing. The crisis for our veterans experiencing homelessness is not over. In the country they enlisted to protect, we can honor their service by ensuring they have access to basic emergency shelters and, more importantly, quality affordable housing.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"By defending this country, veterans have invested in creating a [STREET] that ensures basic human rights, perhaps none more important than affordable housing for themselves and for the people that they served. Thank you for your time. Thank you.",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] also provides on-site organizational and services support to ORG1. The funding that came through the state of emergency helped us meet some of the growing need that we see on the streets and in alternative shelter sites, and critically has helped to expand the reach of three culturally specific organizations, ORG2, [PERSON], and [LOCATION]. Their work with communities that are significantly overrepresented in the population experiencing homelessness is so important in addressing disparities and outcomes for these communities.",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness,"Thank you. Along with our other in-reach partners, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and the ORG2, as well as [PERSON]'s outreach team, hundreds of people make the transition from homelessness to permanent housing [ORGANIZATION]. We know that traditional shelter doesn't work for everyone, and groups like [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION] have organized in response to the need for more safe spaces to rest at [TIME] and more options to find consistency, stability, and community—  We should support the efforts of people experiencing homelessness to organize and create alternative options.",portland
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"We encourage the city to take whatever steps it can during a continued state of emergency to support the efforts of the homeless community to explore alternative shelter opportunities and to facilitate the creation of deeply affordable housing, especially supportive housing. We know that when we make the right resources available to people, they are successful in ending their homelessness. A continued state of emergency would help make those tools available.",portland
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness,"So you focused on the need to provide housing for 400 veterans who continue to be homeless. Under the [PERSON] administration, when President [PERSON] made a commitment to end homelessness among our veterans, we had a superb tool called the VASH voucher, which allowed us to provide services and housing for our veterans. How are we doing under this administration in terms of getting VASH vouchers?",portland
02_21_2019,homeless; affordable housing,"And again, I commend the thinking behind it to spread these shelters out, farther out, in different locations to give the people the ability to stay in maybe the neighborhoods they're homeless in. And I think that's really been effective. From my opinion on the affordable housing bond,  That's been the best thing that's ever happened to this city.",portland
02_21_2019,homeless,"There's no reason why these investors can't begin to commit those units before they do their stadium, before they do anything else. I'd like to see them commit to more of the 0% to 30% units, supportive housing, start bringing in money from [ORGANIZATION], other locations, and show that you're also here to take care of the homeless even if that stadium doesn't happen. Build those 8,000 units.",portland
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness; housing crisis,"So I appreciate the specific directives in this ordinance to make sure we're permanently changing the [STREET] we address housing and homelessness beyond the parameters of a temporary housing crisis. Myself and my office have been working pretty much nonstop on these issues since [ORGANIZATION] we arrived in FAC0. In addition to our work around tenant protections, I also co-chair [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"This is a program that's worked really well in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and has resulted in considerable investment in permanent affordable housing and home ownership opportunities for low-income households. However, without financial assistance for low-income renters to purchase and rehabilitate the properties, it would be a mostly empty gesture that would fail to benefit the people we are trying to assist. Commissioner?",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness,"So number one, well, and I'm not even going to read them as amendments. This is what I want us to consider [ORGANIZATION] in moving forward. We don't have revenue sources specifically identified to fund solutions to homelessness, displacements, and housing affordability issues.",portland
02_21_2019,homeless; housing crisis,"so many housing-related policies and programs cannot be implemented or expanded. It makes perfect sense to me that [ORGANIZATION], as we reconsider the housing state of emergency, that we'd be talking about how we're going to pay for all of these things. Funding for policies and programs such as tenant opportunity to purchase, universal eviction defense, rent subsidies, alternative shelter resources, hygiene resources, and stabilizing and expanding the funding for [ORGANIZATION] is critical to further our goals of minimizing the impacts of the housing crisis.",portland
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness,"If we simply fund [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] level, we may be in a situation where we actually have no money to carve up. And that's not sustainable, even though if I had to take one last dollar that was available, I would invest it in addressing homelessness and the crisis on our streets. That's not sustainable.",portland
02_21_2019,homeless,"Almost coincidentally, every meeting I've had [ORGANIZATION] has been about substance abuse or mental health issues, other public health issues that are clearly impacting people on the streets. Yes. We are constantly looking for resources to address the homeless crisis, which I think most people would acknowledge is the issue.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"And it's an important perspective, I think, to recall our past as we chart our path forward. There were cranes in the air [ORGANIZATION], but the only cranes in the air that I remember were for affordable housing development, which is actually pretty extraordinary because given the collapse of the tax credit market and given all the funding challenges, it's amazing that anything got built [ORGANIZATION]. But we did not have hotels and commercial buildings and market rate residential buildings going up on every [STREET] corner.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"DATE0, we had affordable housing, maybe. And we were grateful in [LOCATION] for the [ORGANIZATION] stimulus money. And we were also grateful for an incredibly resilient community that was skilled, particularly our nonprofit partners, at weathering all the odds and getting product built.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"The combination of the impacts of inclusionary housing, of focused and sustained investment of urban renewal resources and other resources in affordable housing development,  The commitment that we made to 2,000 new units of supportive housing, the reduced barriers to siting shelters, and the renewed conversation about asking every neighborhood to come forward with a creative [STREET] to do their fair share of addressing this crisis is bearing fruit. What we've learned is that this crisis is not over and will continue for some time. [ORGANIZATION]'s proposal is to extend the state of emergency for [LOCATION].",portland
02_21_2019,homeless,"And as [ORGANIZATION] pointed out, it's important that we bake into our code some of these changes to really get some efficiencies in how we do our development going forward. I have visited most of the [ORGANIZATION] cities that are dealing with the same crisis that we are dealing with. In [ORGANIZATION], the city of [ORGANIZATION] is spending literally billions of dollars to address this crisis, and yet per capita they have over two times the number of homeless individuals as we have in the city of [PERSON].",portland
02_21_2019,homelessness,"The city of [ORGANIZATION] is dealing with, on a much grander scale, this contradiction between being a city with an enormously productive economy, on the one hand, with high-tech millionaires being minted [ORGANIZATION], and a huge problem with homelessness and a lack of affordability. The city of [ORGANIZATION], which I visited recently, has a huge problem, and it seems, in my view, harsher. It seems harsher and more prevalent than the crisis that we're experiencing.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"I want to also say that I guess I share Commissioner [PERSON]'s concern about whether or not we're moving. the goalposts. With all due respect to all the people who are working their hearts out to try to do the best they can with the limited resources that they have, the reality is even the term affordable housing is an oxymoron because I can't tell you what's affordable for you, just like you can't tell me what's affordable for me.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"And we have a lot of housing that's posing as affordable housing that working people simply cannot afford to live in. And so we have to do a better job. We the city.  of really being able to identify really what does an affordable housing, what does a unit that people can afford to live in look like?",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"PERSON0. Well, as you've heard [ORGANIZATION], there continues to be a shortage of workforce and affordable housing units in the city. There are, of course, stark disparities in economic prosperity, and that was highlighted by a report that was released [LOCATION] by [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"And far too many people continue to live in unsheltered conditions on our streets. Thank you. During the state of housing emergency, we've been able to provide basic and emergency services expeditiously and fast-track affordable housing projects without compromising quality.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"Since there continues to be an urgent need for services and shelter that cater to basic human needs, I believe it's imperative that we continue to support these services through this appropriate legislative solution. Given the dependency of these actions on a formal state of emergency, the current housing state of emergency should obviously be extended for [ORGANIZATION]. This extension from a practical sense gives us the means to continue to provide a necessary safety net where city boroughs begin work on more sustainable long-term solutions, including but not limited to the legislative proposals that would amend Title 33 under this code to allow for the permanent siting of day storage units.  expeditiously allowing for temporary housing in the issuance of permits related to shelter siting, and creating an expeditious process for design review of affordable housing projects.",portland
02_21_2019,homeless,"And therefore, I support this ordinance. I also just want to be crystal clear, this ordinance is very narrow in its scope. This is one of many tools that [ORGANIZATION] has brought to bear to address both the housing issue as well as the homeless issue.",portland
02_21_2019,homeless,"In addition to the great work that we're collectively doing with the county through [ORGANIZATION],  which is providing prevention services and important shelter services for those who are currently on the [STREET], including services around behavioral health or substance abuse.  and providing, of course, the transition into housing, we at the city have been working very hard. I've worked alongside my colleagues on reforms to both planning and zoning throughout the city to be able to increase the supply of units. We have been very busily reforming our permitting process.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,We've been expediting targeted affordable housing units. We've supported renter protections. We have developed a record number of workforce and affordable housing units through [ORGANIZATION].,portland

With this collaborative, we will all, as a part of the collaborative legal aid services, [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, and [ORGANIZATION] host a [LOCATION] meeting and staff each case. Each client who accesses this collaborative will have access to an attorney and legal representation if discrimination is founded and legal action is recommended.",portland
02_21_2019,housing crisis,"And so we are in a housing crisis. It is really, really difficult for working people to find a house that they can afford to live in. Right.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you. So, you know, I think it is a broader [STREET] of addressing one facet of the problem. And I know truly, yes, we have access issues and we need more affordable housing, but we need to make sure that people are actually having the opportunity to get in that housing.",portland
02_21_2019,housing crisis,"You know, the results of the audit testing showed how far reaching discrimination is in our rental market for black and [ORGANIZATION] renters. The results didn't come as a surprise to us, as we know racism in the rental market, both overt and subtle, is pervasive. We also know that the housing crisis is not just one of affordability but of racialized gentrification.",portland
02_21_2019,affordable housing,"What I also want to discuss, because we talked about housing, as some of you as commissioners know, I'm on [ORGANIZATION]. What I really, truly appreciate about this discussion is that when you think about affordable housing, we all know that the construction costs are skyrocketing. And I can remember as a construction manager, we had to make decisions based on are we putting solar and weatherization on this project and can we make it penciled?",portland
02_21_2019,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"This fund has the opportunity to help subsidize some of these projects to ensure that the tenants and the owners can benefit from these savings and from the affordable housing that's being produced. We also talked in the last segment about homeless housing. This is the opportunity for some of those folks facing homelessness, facing the rising housing rents, to not only be able to live in their city, but to be able to have the income levels to sustain living wherever they choose.",portland
01_02_2019,homeless,"And I think that, you know, [ORGANIZATION] is a perfect example of that. She has been instrumental in signing bills to kill off the homeless, like greenlighting the [ORGANIZATION] sweeping of homeless camps, the removal of our – yeah,",portland
01_02_2019,homeless,"you did, you voted, and it was in a unanimous vote. You voted on that, right?  Wasn't it yes vote? And the removal of homeless so-called zombie RVs, which are killing lots of older disabled homeless people.",portland
01_02_2019,houseless,"And I want us to be careful that we have some kind of criteria for who's on it. I don't want just to have...  since we have so many percentage of people being a certain [STREET], that we have someone who's a token who is not representing the needs, and that just because someone is houseless doesn't mean they don't have really strong, legitimate contributions and legitimacy that we need to hear from. Hear, hear.",portland
02_05_2020,homelessness,"Based on the [ORGANIZATION] assessment data from [ORGANIZATION], about 45% of all third graders in [ORGANIZATION] public schools weren't meeting state reading benchmarks. For students of color, students learning English, and those experiencing poverty or homelessness, the numbers are far more bleak. This is not acceptable and our community can and needs to help solve these issues.",portland
02_05_2020,affordable housing,"I very much appreciate the discussion [ORGANIZATION] and the conversation that Commissioner [PERSON] and I had [LOCATION]. For DATE2, I've been the most I'm an active member of council and looking after people who live outside and trying to find creative solutions for them. I worked for [ORGANIZATION] to move Right to Dream 2 from FAC0 to their current location and I've constantly been looking out for how can we be more helpful to people living outside while at the same time we stress the need for permanent affordable housing.",portland
02_05_2020,affordable housing,"My concerns still remain that as a city, we own property that we then sell, and then we say that the biggest cost, the biggest barrier to building affordable housing is land. and we sell the land and then we go out and we buy more expensive land somewhere else.",portland
02_05_2020,affordable housing,More than 50% of all housing built in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] is on the streetcar line. And nearly 40% of all subsidized affordable housing is on the streetcar line. This is all part of a plan.,portland
02_05_2020,affordable housing,"Like other transit systems, the people who live along the streetcar line are the ones using it. Our census demographics are one to one in terms of who rides the streetcar and who lives along it. So those investments in affordable housing or just generally jobs or institutions, those are paying dividends in terms of our ridership.",portland
02_05_2020,affordable housing,"This is a land use planning grant that's being administered by [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2, looking at potential streetcar expansions in northwest [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON], as well as potential routes on the east side to GPE2. And that work is being managed largely by [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], looking at potential land use changes and the investments in transit and transportation that would have to go along with that. And thinking about what outcomes we can achieve in terms of affordable housing and affordable office as we're building out the city with a streetcar line.",portland
02_05_2020,affordable housing,"And then my second question is, we just celebrated the opening of [ORGANIZATION], which is an affordable housing development along the streetcar line on the east side. Are there more opportunities on the again on the existing system for large-scale development either for affordable housing or economic development? Yeah certainly there's if you think about where the streetcar runs there all of your key development opportunities within the central city are on the streetcar line.",portland

02_14_2018,homeless,"It is nearly impossible for an individual raised in our society to be healthy mentally, emotionally, or physically without sufficient access to hygiene. The false image of someone who is homeless as a dirty bum, unworthy of consideration as a human being, is reinforced by denying basic human services. It is impossible to convey what it feels like to walk down the sidewalk and have nearly everyone I see look at me with contempt, fear, and anger, or worse, make an effort to not acknowledge my existence at all.",portland
02_14_2018,homelessness,"The current policy of trying to clean up the problem of homelessness by sweeps will never work. Pushing people from one [STREET] to another with a stick may temporarily make some sidewalks and mostly more affluent neighborhoods look cleaner. But ultimately, sweeps can never clean anything because people aren't garbage.",portland
02_14_2018,houseless,"And I wound up covering things across the world from [ORGANIZATION] to my latest one, I think on [ORGANIZATION], who was a houseless individual sleeping in a tent and explaining to me what that was like and how he did it and why he didn't come to the city and why he didn't go to shelters. I give the example many times of I tried to cover stories, both interviews and speakers and events with [ORGANIZATION], as well as other projects where I would be a camera operator or audio or lighting with someone else's project to cover things that ORG1 didn't cover. Our network affiliates in town here didn't cover it.",portland

02_10_2016,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] is co-sponsored by [ORGANIZATION] and ORG2, I hope I pronounced that correctly, the nonprofit housing development arm of [ORGANIZATION]. The development will focus a portion of its housing on families at risk of homelessness and fleeing domestic violence. The development is on the city block located at [ORGANIZATION] and FAC1 on land formerly owned by the Catholic parish of FAC2, the former site of [PERSON], a parish that is well known for its commitment to the less fortunate of our city through its DATE0 feeding program,  And most recently, they stepped up when the community needed them to provide emergency shelter during severe DATE1 weather.",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"we're very excited about being able to introduce 106 units of affordable housing in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. As Commissioner [PERSON] has said, this is a great inner-city neighborhood. There's a lot going on.",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"If you've driven around this neighborhood, you've seen a lot of new construction projects. All of them, I believe, are at market rate. There is not a lot, if any, other development of affordable housing occurring in this neighborhood.",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"I also want to acknowledge [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. As was said before, [ORGANIZATION] made a difficult decision to sell this land to us at a rate that was less than they could have received, at a price less than they could have received, if they sold it to any other developer in town. They could have received more money for their parish, but they chose to sell it to us at a price that would make our project work and would allow for affordable housing to be built on this project.",portland
02_10_2016,homelessness,"It will establish units for people who work in the inner east side area, people moving out of homelessness, and people escaping domestic violence. The project is based on the core standards that we have in [ORGANIZATION], the dignity and respect of the individuals we serve. There will be on-site case management services for many of the clients.",portland
02_10_2016,homeless,"It's an important social justice statement in this neighborhood as it arises out of what has become a sanctuary park for homeless individuals [ORGANIZATION]. And before that, a neighborhood and school park to now stand against the forces of gentrification and high pricing that none of our clients could afford. Our partnership with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], with the ORG2 is really just a remarkable set of opportunities.",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Ms. [PERSON], add a few words? I'm the pastor leader of [ORGANIZATION], and I also want to offer my gratitude for the funding the city is putting into this project. [ORGANIZATION] Parish actually has been aware of a lack of affordable housing and workforce housing in the city for quite a while, and we've been actually working for [ORGANIZATION] to find the right partners to build a project that the parish felt good about in our neighborhood.",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"We're, like many, like all affordable housing projects [ORGANIZATION], it's complex to put the project together. The city funding is one of 10 sources of financing in the project. Some of the other parties that are providing loans or grants or equity, investors' equity, are [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2.",portland
02_10_2016,homelessness,And so we should acknowledge that  commissioner [ORGANIZATION] pioneered that idea and i think it's now the right arrangement where we're not in the business of lose but someone else is and they're doing quite well the third comment i want to make is that we had a work session DATE0 about the mayor's proposal for camping and how we're going to address homelessness and those details are still being worked out but one of the things that i think struck all of us is that we have a crisis that we've identified on our streets And we have to have a housing strategy that ensures a [STREET] for people who've been on our streets to go.,portland
02_10_2016,homelessness,so i really compliment you for that and the other thing that jumped out at me on the pro forma and i was going to ask [ORGANIZATION] just to elaborate on this it says that there'll be 25 units set aside for at-risk households and you'll be putting project-based section 8 vouchers so for for for the average person watching that could you tell us what that means  Sure. So there are 25 units that will be set aside for a combination of women who are escaping domestic violence or women who are in or at risk of homelessness. So we have units that are set aside for them.,portland
02_10_2016,homeless; affordable housing,This project has nothing to do with the homeless. Affordable housing is a scam. It's 60% of the going rate here.,portland
02_10_2016,homeless,"That's $65,000. 60% of that is $40,000. That has nothing to do with the homeless.",portland
02_10_2016,homeless,"So, Mr. [PERSON], don't you dare use the homeless to justify this mess. Thank you. Thanks, [PERSON].",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Everything looks good as far as on the numbers. And again, as Mr. [PERSON] has stated, the term affordable housing units, current MFI, is always under debate and always can be changed. Again, my position is if you want to lower rents and offer housing, you build more housing.",portland
02_10_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"Keep them building if you want to decrease homelessness. Do not impede the developers. And when we're talking about the fossil fuel industry extraction companies...  begin to stop their subsidies and begin to understand, don't fund everything over to the solar systems and those directions, but also fund a percentage to the affordable housing industries as subsidies to keep the developers building more units.",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"We have a tremendous amount of subsidies out there that need to start being directed in affordable housing, creating more jobs, more housing, and will shut the fossil fuel industries down. That's what needs to be done. This type of loan here, again, if these facts are true by Mr. [PERSON], do not fund this money if your socially and morally responsible policy within this city has any meaning and any bearing.",portland
02_10_2016,homeless,"Unfortunately, the [STREET] our economy works out, there's no longer a school associated with that location. But I've visited with the people of [ORGANIZATION] in worship. And if any community is working hard to increase protection of vulnerable people, be they children or the homeless in this community, it is [PERSON].",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"So it's good that this is getting attention, especially to promote the healing of those victims that are covered related to that bankruptcy and settlement. But we obviously need much more than 100, 106 units of affordable housing. We need more projects where a higher percentage is for the 30 and below.",portland

02_10_2016,affordable housing,"And this is, as I said, 106 units of affordable housing, 10 of those units deeply affordable, and helping victims of domestic violence. These are all the types of attributes that we should be supporting as a city, and I'm proud to vote aye. No, thank you.",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"I echo what my colleagues have said. I appreciate Commissioner [PERSON] pointing out that from the city's perspective, when we've been struggling with what people have called the high cost of affordable housing, this is a bargain. I appreciate everyone's work.",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"The proclamation referred to the 11 by 13 preservation campaign, which was led by Commissioner [PERSON]. One notable event which I want to share among all those great accomplishments was in [ORGANIZATION], a waiver was approved by [ORGANIZATION] headquarters for the use of $7 million of [ORGANIZATION] residual receipts for construction costs for some 11 of these projects. This was accomplished through communication, cooperation, and shared affordable housing goals of ORG1, ORG2, [PERSON], and [LOCATION].",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Again, it's a partnership, cooperation. It takes many hands to get this work done. I want to mention briefly the ORG0 multifamily still remains committed to affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] and in [PERSON].",portland
02_10_2016,affordable housing,"Significantly on [ORGANIZATION], the ORG0 initial closing of [ORGANIZATION]'s FAC0 was accomplished through, again, communication and cooperation among many affordable housing partners in the state and the city, But we especially want to note that [PERSON] was instrumental in facilitating the issuance of the building permits for [ORGANIZATION]'s FAC0 by ORG2.

So you guys are criminally charging journalists  and beating up mentally ill men. And one of these homeless people that got these charges is actually a schizophrenic.",portland
02_03_2016,homeless,"So that's a real good job you guys are doing for this homeless state of emergency. And, you know, there is a [ORGANIZATION] settlement against the city, you know. Maybe you guys might want to actually start.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"And I wish we had a more robust tool.  to preserve that particular class of affordable housing in our community because in this current market, it's particularly vulnerable. We just don't have a great tool. But congratulations.",portland
02_03_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"A half million dollars is an important amount of money for FAC0, or whatever we named the park in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. But a half million dollars in a city that, as Commissioner [PERSON] noted, is having a housing crisis, is losing low-income affordable housing, is not a significant money. A half million dollars...  is only the payroll for five of the 40 city attorneys.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"But they do have some concerns about the implementation of such a policy by cities if that ban is lifted. And in particular, with respect to [ORGANIZATION], there are concerns about how we will engage the development community in the process and that we consider the impact of the impending changes that we have on the table in a holistic manner, that we look at issues around linkage fees, around FAR bonus incentives, as well as inclusionary housing, and that we consider those all together. And so we have a resolution here that is in response to a request by Senator [PERSON] to put [ORGANIZATION] on the record that during any consideration by the city of inclusionary housing, that we would engage in a community-wide data-driven discussion that would include the development community as well as affordable housing experts and advocates, and further, that a panel of housing experts...  with representation from the development community, would be expected to advise the council throughout the discussion of an inclusionary housing ordinance.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"As a result, it is increasingly difficult for working families  to live in neighborhoods close to their employment and where their children attend school, whereas an inclusionary housing ordinance would provide an affordable housing tool that links the production of affordable housing to the production of market-rate housing. Inclusionary housing policies reduce affordable housing by requiring new residential developments to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units, whereas if the legislature were to lift the preemption on inclusionary housing,  in [ORGANIZATION] session, it would allow [ORGANIZATION] to comprehensively consider the use of the tool, while it also considers its comprehensive plan, incentive zoning, and linkage fee proposal. Now, therefore, be it resolved, if ORG1 lifts the statewide preemption on inclusionary housing ordinances, [ORGANIZATION] would consider the use of an inclusionary housing ordinance to create affordable housing  within new market rate residential developments and be it further resolved during the consideration of any inclusionary housing ordinance, [ORGANIZATION] would engage in a community-wide data-driven discussion that would include but would not be limited to members of the development community as well as affordable housing experts and advocates.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"and to see this committee come together to formulate and to come up with preference policy and other important ideas to help bring this to pass and even obtain additional funds to support the programs has been a dream come true. And I've learned quite a bit, and I'm still learning as a part of this committee, what it takes to have a city involved and what it takes to help people that are in need, and especially with affordable housing. It's one of the things that has caused a lot of cities in this country to...  fall apart and to cause problems in the city.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"But I believe [PERSON] is taking the right initiative in getting a group like this oversight committee together, people that are knowledgeable and even people such as myself that I'm learning about the process to be able to participate and do something in a positive [STREET] to help improve things for this city. I think this is a great city and it can  have a good legacy by participating as it is participating now and continues to participate and support and to be able to bring back affordable housing so people can indeed live in the city, they can work in the city where their jobs are, children can be educated in their communities and back into the schools and see some benefits  wonderful things happen for our community residents. I was looking recently at [ORGANIZATION], who has done a wonderful job in graduating students.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"So some of these are our own next steps and other sort of expectations that we have for what we'll be hearing about and learning about. First, in land banking, our report to the [ORGANIZATION] and our expectation from the [ORGANIZATION] is to see a plan and a strategy developed and to have our oversight function as we move into land banking. Land banking was added as part of this $20 million allocation because of our recognition, many community-based organizations and housing organizations' recognition of the top speed at which the market is moving, that it's really critical to take land off the market now so that it can be used in combination with other subsidies to develop affordable housing.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"I could spend [TIME], I got [TIME] here, I could spend [TIME] talking about this stuff. There's a lot of bad stuff going on in our country and people aren't even talking about it. When it comes to affordable housing, that's my background.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"Now, if it can't work, I want them to tell me why it can't. Listen, when it comes to affordable housing, let me tell you something about affordable housing. I've got [TIME].",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"I've got [TIME]. I'll give you [TIME]. There's five things you need to build affordable housing, five.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"that is specifically for that purpose. [ORGANIZATION] has a land banking fund that they have not, [ORGANIZATION] have not been utilized to a great extent. As you recall, [ORGANIZATION] is a nonprofit affordable housing lender for the state.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"We stand ready to mobilize all the resources available to us. The idea of using [ORGANIZATION] as the intermediary is actually much more nimble, much more agile. It's flexible.  2% money for [ORGANIZATION], so it's interest only on the loan balance for a DATE1 period of time, with the idea being that it would not be a long-term hold.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"As I look around this chamber, there are so many stalwarts of affordable housing and of champions from [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]east [LOCATION] in the room here, all here maybe to listen, maybe just to support, but all deeply engaged in this process. And that's what it takes to come up with a plan that begins to correct some of the wrongs of the past. And I'm very, very impressed.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"As I said, I will look  to duplicating this in [ORGANIZATION] and perhaps in some of our other projects. It's probably a little early to declare success yet, but it's certainly an amazing start, and I am very pleased that you took the time to come to give a detailed report to council and all the community support  We do have many challenges for affordable housing, for home ownership, for displacement, a wide range of housing challenges, which certainly [ORGANIZATION] that I've been on the council, we've tripled the housing budget. We have done...  what we thought we could, the most we thought we could do at the time.",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"And for that, I'm grateful, [ORGANIZATION], to you and the committee. thank you [PERSON] and mayor [PERSON] thank you director PERSON3 who in his short stint here has really made a difference i'm pleased to accept the report aye well i also wanted to recognize mayor [PERSON] because he was really the the genesis for the whole notion of dedicating 20 million dollars in additional urban renewal dollars specifically to go towards affordable housing production and anti-displacement activities",portland
02_03_2016,affordable housing,"So thank you, Mayor [PERSON]. I want to also thank the members of [ORGANIZATION], who we've entrusted with coming up with the policies and the programs to make this real, to increase affordable housing production in the [ORGANIZATION] area, to provide anti-displacement activities and funding, and to look at things like a preference policy to provide people the ability to move  live or live again in the [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] area. I want to recognize many key staff who have and [PERSON], thank you for your capable leadership from [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] and to all the committee members.",portland
01_08_2020,homelessness,"And I thank PERSON0 and [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON2 for letting us have so much of PERSON3. People don't realise that when you're on the council, you're just on all the time. You go to the grocery store at [TIME] at [TIME] trying to get your family a jug of milk and somebody's right there telling you, could you please do something about homelessness?",portland
01_08_2020,affordable housing,"I think a lot about the impact of the work we do now on future generations, about how [ORGANIZATION], when we are largely forgotten, our invisible fingerprints will still be left all over the city. Commissioner [PERSON] made some of his finest marks in affordable housing, environmental services, parks, and the cleanup and restoration of our waterways. But my personal debt of gratitude to [PERSON] is that he welcomed me in and insisted i take my [STREET] not as an outsider but as an integral part of something much bigger and more important than ourselves or our differences it was an honor to serve on this council with him he brought such valuable knowledge and history equanimity humor civility and an endless willingness to find the reasonable amicable compromise as our unofficial mediator and middle child of the council.",portland
01_08_2020,homeless; homelessness,"So we'll take that as a compliment. [ORGANIZATION], this is a unique program that we helped establish in [ORGANIZATION]. It provides accessibility to soccer for homeless youth or those in danger of homelessness.",portland
01_08_2020,homeless,"There is a potential we'd love to host a regional national homeless [STREET] soccer event in the future because of the success of this chapter. This was started in [ORGANIZATION]. We saw it and brought it to the attention of the soccer community here and helped launch this nonprofit, get them going.",portland
01_08_2020,homeless,"I don't see homeless people, they collect all the plastic bottles. I don't see, they eat food waste out of the garbage. They eat leftovers.",portland
01_08_2020,homelessness,"I have a request. hear the presentation first because I will continue to enforce the rules and there's people in this chamber who I really would like to hear the full conversation and the full discussion. So with that, colleagues, I think everybody here understands that homelessness is a humanitarian problem.",portland
01_08_2020,homelessness,"So, I was in my very early introductory remarks on item number 15. Homelessness in [ORGANIZATION], I'm sure we all agree, is a humanitarian crisis. I think we can also agree that camp cleanups are difficult but necessary work to sustain and improve the safety and livability of our city.",portland
01_08_2020,homelessness,The staff of rapid response can offer us these intangibles. 63% of their employees have experienced the criminal justice system firsthand. 59% have experienced homelessness firsthand.,portland
01_08_2020,homelessness,"Thank you. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm the manager of the City's [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON1, can you slide that just a little bit closer?",portland
01_08_2020,homelessness,"Good morning. My name is [ORGANIZATION] and I'm a program coordinator with [ORGANIZATION], or ORG1 by our better known acronym. But we are the group responsible for administering the One Point of Contact campsite reporting system.",portland
01_08_2020,homelessness,"Individuals need to only pick one. PERSON0, our group, a team of three, we receive anywhere from 800 to 1,200 reports a week surrounding issues of homelessness. This is our campsite report form for folks that are not familiar.",portland
01_08_2020,homeless,"But typically, our first responder is a group called [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] is a homeless to work program through ORG1. They respond by going to the reported location and conducting an assessment on behalf of the city.",portland
01_08_2020,unhoused,"It is our intent to be as transparent as possible with everyone in the community, both housed and unhoused, so that folks know what we are doing and when. In [ORGANIZATION], 15% of all sites assessed by [ORGANIZATION] were posted for cleanup. That means out of all the sites [ORGANIZATION] went to assess, only 15% met our posting thresholds and were actually posted.",portland
01_08_2020,houseless,"So if you're thinking about you do X number total, right, of cleanups, how many of them actually end up displacing people who are houseless? Do you know, like, can you tell me what the percentage is or what the real numbers are? Sure.",portland
01_08_2020,homelessness,So this is our group's performance measures. Folks can find this also on our website in more detail for those that are interested. Our group is not designed to solve homelessness.,portland
01_08_2020,homeless,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. That was great. And again, my name is [PERSON], and I manage this homeless and suburban camping and act reduction program.",portland
01_08_2020,houseless,"I want to make sure that for the record, the public knows that the plan is that you will have to come back to [ORGANIZATION] before there is any extension of this contract, that we will have community conversations with frontline community members to make sure that they are their feedback is incorporated into whatever the next steps are and that number three that we will have a city council work session with invited testimony before any additional contracting is done with this one contract. I want to also encourage the folks that are working on the [STREET] to actually really engage with those community members who are frontline workers with houseless community members and help develop opportunities for them to be employed to be able to help with these cleanups as well. right?",portland
01_08_2020,homelessness,"Well, I want to thank our community partners, especially [ORGANIZATION] for bringing their concerns to our attention and for being patient with us as we work to improve and move this work forward. I've been working on homelessness issues since I first arrived in [ORGANIZATION]. My office facilitated multiple meetings between community advocates, the mayor's office, and ORG2.",portland
01_08_2020,homelessness,PERSON0. I want to hone in on something [PERSON] said during his presentation. This is not our strategy to end homelessness.,portland
01_08_2020,homelessness,"And I want to appreciate the hard work you've put into it. And we will continue to work on our primary strategies, which are compassionate and effective to address homelessness, whether it's prevention. DATE0, through the joint office in a home for everyone, 7,000 people received prevention services in this community, people who are at high risk of becoming homelessness.",portland
01_08_2020,homeless,"DATE0, over 6,000 people were homeless. moved either from the streets or from shelter into housing. 35,000 people in this community received other services, whether it was prevention, shelter, access to services, or transitioned into housing.",portland
01_08_2020,affordable housing,"We work through the housing bureau on affordable housing. So there's many things that we are doing, and I want to acknowledge something Commissioner [PERSON] might have mentioned if you were here [ORGANIZATION]. Which is we have pursued a very aggressive set of goals around permanent supportive housing.",portland
01_08_2020,homeless,"To address those who are chronically homeless, those who have the greatest health needs. to help them get off the [STREET]. We committed to 2,000 units of permanent supportive housing in this community over [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_08_2020,houseless,"Whereas all people living in or visiting [ORGANIZATION] do not have equal access to the protection and benefits of the urban tree canopy, which impacts their ability to breathe healthy air, exercise, stay cool, and pursue happiness. These people include children, houseless, elderly, and those living in low-income areas. Be it further resolved that the city takes specific steps to meet with the most impacted communities in decisions made regarding tree preservation.",portland
01_08_2020,houseless,"Whereas all people living in or visiting [ORGANIZATION] do not have equal access to the protection and benefits of the urban tree canopy, which impacts their ability to breathe healthy air, exercise, stay cool and pursue happiness. These people include children, houseless, elderly and those living in low-income areas. I second that.",portland
01_22_2020,homelessness,"It seems that they assume that the children's innocence will somehow be tarnished if they see homelessness. or that the children might be afraid of people who are experiencing homelessness. My answer to that question is that we tell them that we live in a community where we care about one another, no matter our differences, because of our humanity.",portland
01_22_2020,homeless,"Let's make visible the words of [ORGANIZATION] who said, The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. As part of [ORGANIZATION], a teacher at the neighboring preschool, and a neighbor, I'm committed to working with [PERSON], ORG2, and the parents of my young students to ensure that this village is a success. Thank you for considering my point of view.",portland
01_22_2020,unhoused,"DATE0, I actually helped launch the coalition with around 20 other neighbors when I was working at [ORGANIZATION]. Since then, we've grown to become a vibrant and active network of nearly 300 neighbors who have signed our letter of support. This includes both housed and unhoused neighbors, business owners, faith-based leaders, and leaders of key community groups and schools.",portland
01_22_2020,houseless,"I'm also a mom of a [ORGANIZATION] who goes to preschool about five blocks away from the proposed site. In both of my capacities as a neighborhood activist and a mom, I want to extend my gratitude to [ORGANIZATION], Mayor [PERSON], and all the commissioners in support of this project. I've spent a lot of time working with houseless neighbors in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_22_2020,housing crisis,"We know that the village is not the end all be all and that neighbors, including members of our coalition still have questions. But the village is an important resource that we are fortunate to have in [ORGANIZATION] and we have faith that we can constructively and collaboratively figure out the unknowns. Plus it's just really cool seeing a faith based community who has long sat on open land offering up their property as a solution to [PERSON]'s housing crisis.",portland
01_22_2020,houseless,"We've got a lot of people who are suffering on our streets, and I am so grateful and appreciative of people like you who understand that we all have a role in actually helping people who are suffering. So in my neighborhood, we also have an anti-houseless group but they're not actually offering to provide housing so that those folks don't have to be on the [STREET]. And so I thank you very much for being here.",portland
01_22_2020,houseless,"Before you start, [ORGANIZATION], I just want to remind you, and I know you know this, [ORGANIZATION] is funded totally through the general fund, as is our houseless services, as is fire, as is [TIME]. There are other bureaus that have specific money based on rates, based on et cetera, et cetera, right? [ORGANIZATION] doesn't have that luxury.",portland
01_22_2020,houseless,"I realize that there are a whole lot of great intent going out and killing things that shouldn't be here, but people shouldn't be one of them. And there is an unbelievable amount of reports that I'm hearing from the houseless community about how they've been sprayed. This is not the issue that we are addressing.",portland
02_17_2016,homeless,I am here to talk about on behalf of a group of homeless campers that are camped along FAC0 over in southeast [ORGANIZATION]. I'm having a bit of trouble. I just had a tooth pulled,portland
02_17_2016,homeless,"No, we can't do it yet. We'll go to regular calendar. Item 153.  153, authorize a competitive solicitation for the provision of treatment readiness services, transitional housing, and follow-up retention support services to chemically dependent homeless adult chronic arrestees.",portland
02_17_2016,homeless,"And that technically complies with our public contracting laws, but it doesn't give us the ability to measure their performance and their proposal against other options. And whether we choose to require co-location or not, for example, in [ORGANIZATION], we have all kinds of different providers that provide services to homeless people throughout a continuum. We don't have one provider that manages shelters, does transitional housing, does other things.",portland
02_17_2016,homeless,"And we're talking about barricades amongst the homeless. I mean... They have people sweeping people [ORGANIZATION], the most vulnerable people, moving them from one spot to the next.",portland
02_17_2016,homeless,"They're one of the only city agencies that actually get notified of homeless sweeps that are going on. And they're supposed to go out and do outreach, which they rarely do. And one thing about [ORGANIZATION], too, is you can't just go to [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_17_2016,homeless,"And these agencies are actually, you know, you talk about collaboration. I agree they need to collaborate because, you know, I was actually homeless and I fell back to the streets through going through [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_17_2016,homeless,"And when we look through the records of how many homeless people have died when we're averaging a number of, say, 50 to 100 a year, and we start looking at the data that it trickles down to people with addictions, we have to understand the trauma that they're facing when they're out on the streets and society has pushed them away out of their homes, their apartments. Friends have stepped at a distance because law enforcement might say, hey,  That's guilt by association. If you're near that person, if you're a friend with that person, we're looking at you also, and we want to know what you're doing.",portland
02_17_2016,homelessness,"Sure.  let me repeat what i said earlier before you before you start before you start excuse me i want to say that it's ridiculous it costs 85 a night to house people in these transitional contractors that have been working with the city since forever who's who's responsible for that  It is a cycle that keeps going. They're making money off of homelessness. It's part of the capitalist system of [ORGANIZATION], and it's not working.",portland
02_17_2016,homeless,I have a slumlord. I have [PERSON] throughout my building. I've been homeless for [ORGANIZATION] now This is when I first came here in [LOCATION],portland
02_17_2016,homeless,"and I was calling PERSON0 PERSON1 fish because I thought she was [ORGANIZATION]  After all of this, I finally found a [STREET] to live, but it takes me [TIME] to get here to testify on behalf of many people who would like to just have $50 a month to pay for a roof over their housing. And while I applaud you for finally in your lame duck session for getting emergency housing for the people on the streets, we're talking 20,000 children that have been killed.  identified as homeless in our communities I teach at one of those schools thank you there are many more people on the house on the streets and we need to house them the people that are already housed need only a little bit of per month and that'll be much cheaper for the city to keep the housing and put in rent control when I told that head of the home forward that we need rent control I said you may be out of a job  but at least you'd be out of a job in a city with rent control thank you thanks very much thank you for calling upon me again mayor all right anyone else on this item then this council go ahead and want to go ahead and take action okay then let's take a vote please on the ordinance",portland
02_17_2016,homelessness,"It has meant that [ORGANIZATION] staff have left the very communities they serve in order to find housing for their families. It has meant empty cupboards, empty bank accounts, and a number of disturbing cases, bankruptcy and homelessness. This practice not only hurt [ORGANIZATION] staff, it hurt our communities.",portland
02_17_2016,homeless; housing crisis,"So as long as [ORGANIZATION] is under Commissioner [PERSON], to please consider the livability of our communities in hand with the parks. DATE0 seems to me to be a very arbitrary number as far as the [STREET] we've built our city. And I don't know if you get around as much as I do,  As a homeless person and as a person who's been moved around a lot because of the housing crisis in our city over [LOCATION], I've been very, very discouraged by the [STREET] we live.",portland
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"And, [ORGANIZATION], I appreciated the presentation that Director [PERSON] gave DATE0 because he laid out where we are and where we intend to go through the [ORGANIZATION] framework. And I'll be discussing with both you and the mayor a housing impact statement that can become a regular feature of these matters so we can –  we can test where we are against the um the goals that we've established as a bureau and a council this has been a successful development and i have long believed that we should have the option of extending the abatement for long DATE1 because the commensurate public benefit is affordable housing in our community so i'm pleased to support this [ORGANIZATION]  well as commissioner PERSON3 alluded to this is a good investment worth renewing it maintains 203 out of 209 units to be affordable with 131 of those units affordable to those between zero and sixty percent of median family income so it's a very worthwhile uh abatement worth continuing hi ORG1 fails",portland
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"We hear from about 3,000 older adults in our community. And the four areas of major concern right now are housing, not a surprise, I suppose, affordable housing, identity theft, scams, and fraud. transportation, and isolation and neglect.",portland
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"a group of older adults headed down to [ORGANIZATION] to advocate for affordable housing. In response to the number of calls that we're getting from older adults who are being priced out of their homes and can't afford the large rent increases or experiencing no-cause evictions, we decided that we wanted to educate ourselves about how to be better advocates for this. And so we created a series, a session, to help older adults be their best debt.",portland
02_17_2016,housing insecurity,"So those who had experienced housing insecurity. And then we created a partnership with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], to put together a series of  which we could become better housing advocates and this included that trip to soon that you see there and also participating in the [PERSON]'s discrimination tour which gave us a little bit of a historical perspective on the issues facing us [ORGANIZATION] the next slide shows oh that's part of that was one of the activities to one of our volunteers this one is the  It's the opening of FAC0, so we participate in those community events also.",portland
02_17_2016,homelessness,"We know that some of the actions there in [ORGANIZATION] were good, but they could be improved upon, especially in light of the current crisis and homelessness issues that we're facing in our community. We also want to identify priorities to increase age-friendliness in [ORGANIZATION]'s housing. This is actually not as easy of a lift as I originally thought.",portland
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"It also has fed into a lot of temporary housing opportunities, such as FAC0. And then in some areas, and specifically you'll hear from [ORGANIZATION], actually the deconstruction of homes leads to affordable homes because it's helping support their affordable housing efforts. Thank you.",portland
02_17_2016,homelessness,"We offer a minimum starting salary of $12.50 an hour with full health benefits and [ORGANIZATION] paid vacation, depending on the length of tenure. And our profits, such as they are,  are reinvested into the community through our community outreach program. And we also donate tens of thousands of dollars of materials to various organizations around town [LOCATION], including many that address the issue of homelessness, such as [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2.",portland
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"This would more than double our fundraising for affordable housing as well and enable [ORGANIZATION] and our neighbors to build an additional 14 homes per year. In looking to build our deconstruction program, we have already started partnering with [ORGANIZATION] to start priming our customers for salvage lumber. We are also talking to deconstruction contractors about setting up partnerships that would allow us to do a hybrid-type decon where they would take the building down and our volunteers and staff could capture the salvage materials.",portland
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"I think several of you already know we own over 800 units of single- and multifamily affordable housing here in the city of [ORGANIZATION], located in over 30 neighborhoods. We believe that everyone should be able to afford a safe, stable, and healthy home. We develop affordable housing for families to rent and for first-time homebuyers.",portland
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"Being a manual process, deconstruction, as we've talked about a little bit here too, though, equals more labor and more opportunity for living wage jobs. And as a provider of affordable housing and knowing that the amount of housing that is affordable to many working families in [ORGANIZATION] right now isn't keeping up with the need, the opportunity to provide jobs is very important, too.  to help us bridge that gap and to ensure that folks are self-sufficient, which is certainly an end goal that I think we all have. I do just want to bring up very briefly a couple of considerations and perhaps challenges that I've seen and I'm sort of aware of with the potential for deconstruction.",portland
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"It does cost developers a little more money and time sometimes, probably more often than not, but that's the cost of replacing with new construction. When they're not deconstructed, the building is being subsidized by the neighbors and the environment, and we just have to be clear about that. Deconstruction is not a detriment to affordable housing.",portland
02_17_2016,affordable housing,"I heard [ORGANIZATION] say that it was cost neutral. I've heard that it's $9,000 to $10,000, and a lot depends on what has to be done. Excavation is a big issue because when they deconstruct and there's a basement,  part of the deconstruction does not include the excavation so then whoever is doing the building has to then hire someone to do that added excavation so there was a concern of how that cost would be covered and most people are pointing saying well the developer or the landowner should pay for that but  it's only going to trickle downhill or uphill to the next buyer for affordable housing.",portland
02_17_2016,affordable housing,So those are the concerns. I addressed the concerns at [ORGANIZATION] about the equity and the funding and how it would affect  affect affordable housing that comes after. That was a big one.,portland

So I think that's it. Thank you very much.",portland

So despite the long history of them helping people in need, we know very little about what they're doing. And they serve primarily a diverse population.",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"Faith-based organizations have historically steered clear government because we require a lot of restraints and a lot of rules and things that they don't generally feel like they should have to –  to do in order to provide help to people. This innovation project aims to couple the specialized care and commitment provided by faith-based organizations serving the homeless with city services and housing resources. As part of the proposal, we'll appoint a staff member as a faith-based liaison to work with churches to develop a data and information sharing program.",portland

Now, one of the things that I like about this, and I'm referring mainly on the homelessness on the data sharing, what I'd like to see possibly is more data on more of a [ORGANIZATION] count of people that are homeless, say, on a [LOCATION] basis out through the city. But why I mention that is I want to see more of a,  maybe a more of a sophisticated system set up to where we really monitor that number.",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"And I'm talking about where people get their food, if they're chronically homeless outside. I want to have that data to really understand that number, how it's changing, how it's changing with the population, with people moving out of the state, people moving into the state, etc.  I really want that number to even be broken down to central downtown, east side, certain areas by the block. I want that number accessed.",portland

01_14_2015,homeless,"I know that it's a difficult issue for to find funding in places, you know, there are federal restrictions. We really, we kind of know that we just need more units and Commissioner [PERSON] and all of you have worked to take steps in that direction. [TIME] I was particularly aware of which doorways already had people asleep prior towards [TIME] and I hope that  [ORGANIZATION] we might have some capacity to directly approach people and engage, have a facility where we can actually rescue people and actually just accost people and actually be glad that some homeless people, all they want to do is rest.",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"He's not the chief, and I don't have his card. I have a couple other people's information that I gathered. But I was concerned because I live in a downtown [ORGANIZATION] area, and there are a lot of homeless people that live in that area that I live in, and I think I proposed to you to really come out there on the streets and hang out with me for a [ORGANIZATION] or two.",portland
01_14_2015,homelessness,"I think everything happened for a reason in this life. If I had not been there for her and her being there for me, I wouldn't still be here because she was the person that encouraged me to continue to keep going with this movement. And as I've been a part of it, it's just been so many touching factors to what's going on with our population of people of homelessness, of mental illness, and all of these different things in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"And it's just so hurtful that I'm collecting data. I'm advocating for homeless people at this point. And I'm setting up a space for them to come because they're not going to come down here with all their luggage and everything that they have, you know, to talk to someone that they don't know that really haven't done nothing for them.",portland
01_14_2015,homeless; homelessness,"And there's several pictures. I'm compiling a documentary about the homeless people,  you know the hiddenness behind homelessness and it's not always about a person being an addict you know people want help in this city but if they're having to be out on the [STREET] and women have to get with the man that they don't know just to have a pallet to lay down and i could get to go to a warm bed [TIME] mayor that's not right for me thank you so much for being here and for coming forward and being an advocate thank you",portland
01_14_2016,homeless,oh no but that's why I'm just bringing I'm just leading into something I'm sorry I am just my point was and we have an issue with the homeless and yet there was three hundred thousand dollars available for this bike study,portland
01_14_2016,homeless,"But an admired leader said that at this time you can't set this area aside like a rare book and say nobody can touch it. You really need users  to come with you and help you maintain and manage it and patrol this area to keep out the homeless camps, the dumps, and things like that. So I really encourage you to consider getting the mountain bikers involved in doing the trail design.",portland
02_04_2015,houseless,"Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding houseless issues. Good morning, [PERSON]. Welcome.",portland
02_04_2015,houseless,"What I want to talk about is the present situation of the houseless people sleeping out in the streets. I know we was doing a houseless count to get exact numbers, and I heard it was passed down through the Commissioner [PERSON] that there would be no sweeps so they can get the proper count of the houseless community. Well, I had slides and I have proof that the people were still being swept and they were being told they took their belongings and they were being told to sit there and wait for people to come and...  and do a survey for them.",portland
02_04_2015,homeless,"So I would implore you that you sponsor the Homeless Bill of Rights Right to Rest Act that's going before legislators as we speak now, and I would like for you all to back us up because who knows best what the homeless community is suffering in this city. Thank you. That's all I have to say.",portland
02_04_2015,homeless,"We still have anywhere from 1,800 to 3,[ADDRESS] to sleep and be safe from the police. Police sweeps continue. Fencing off areas used by campus seems to be the new threat to the homeless.",portland
02_04_2015,homeless,"How we can adapt that to micro community for the homeless in [ORGANIZATION] would be to go ahead and build that exact community, except that half that money, approximately half that money, would not go to refinance the next micro community, but would pay the rent for the other half of the people that are going to stay there transitionally. So what we would have is a 50 percent of the folks paying the rent,  The other 50% receiving a free [STREET] to stay for a determined amount of time, whatever the caseworkers would think is appropriate to get them on their feet. This program, I believe, should not focus on the chronically homeless.",portland
02_04_2015,homeless,"It should focus on the folks that are just on the verge of becoming homeless, that just need a little bit of help. They don't need [ORGANIZATION] of free rent. They just need a [STREET] to stay for a [LOCATION] or two while they move on to wherever they're going to move on to.",portland
02_04_2015,homeless,"So this is not really a program for chronically homeless, but it certainly could be a project for chronically homeless. Yes. So initially, that one program at FAC0 and FAC1, we could build that for less than $1 million.",portland
02_04_2015,homeless,"Have you put an offer to buy it? As soon as we finished our architect, finished his job, or other teams finished their jobs, we took it and presented it to [ORGANIZATION] homeless event, and within [ORGANIZATION] it was sold. So we're trying not to tell people where we're planning our projects because they have a tendency to sell quickly.",portland
02_04_2015,homeless,"And we would like to talk to you privately about that as well. Okay, good. So we could, if you guys wanted to give us, say, in [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION], to come back and give you a presentation with all of us for a site-specific micro-community, specifically for the homeless issue, we could do that.",portland
02_04_2015,homeless,"Not really, no. There really is no forum to come and talk about a new sort of micro-community. Micro-communities are new to begin with, let alone homeless micro-communities, low-income micro-communities.",portland
02_04_2015,homeless,"That seems to complicate things quite a bit. So we think we could partner with the city on a homeless micro-community and set a precedence.  that other cities could easily replicate. In fact, we have a lot of other cities that are calling us and trying to find out about this.",portland
02_04_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], I believe, is chairing that. It's on the homeless issue. We've had a meeting after meeting, committee after committee after committee.",portland
02_04_2015,homeless,"I think we would be remiss if we didn't thank Commissioner [PERSON] for all her hard work on putting us in a better position to improve services at our parks and the voters also. I hope that since the recent homeless count happened, that there'll be some encouragement for [ORGANIZATION] and also the group working with FAC0,  to be realistic and honest about the fact that all over our city we have homeless people. And if there are not [TIME] facilities, they're going to take care of their business outdoors in the parks, even though the parks are technically closed.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"At the outset of this hearing, I wanted to highlight an important part of this resolution that should provide some context for the testimony ahead. I know we'll hear about height issues in the central city, as well as transportation and sustainability challenges. But my goal here [ORGANIZATION] as [ORGANIZATION] is to make sure that we –  take some bold and vigorous steps to make sure that we provide for affordable housing in our central city and to do so in a [STREET] that will prevent our city from turning into [ORGANIZATION] where people on either end of the income scale can live, where you're either very rich or you're very poor, but nowhere in the middle.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"And my goal, as well as that of [ORGANIZATION], is,  as they expressed in their deliberations on this quadrant plan, West Quadrant Plan, is to see that the central city accommodates people of affordable housing stock for people in the 0 to 80% of median income range. And that's something I very much agree with, but I also recognize that we lack  the financial resources to make that happen and we need to be creative and engage in some creative thinking uh for policy tools that will enable us to get there and I know that the both the ORG1 staff as well as the ORG2 staff the mayor staff and my staff and [ORGANIZATION] has signed off on coming up with incentives  for height or [PERSON] that are tied directly into creation of more affordable housing stock within the city, either creation of the affordable housing directly by whomever is developing the property or by paying into a housing investment fund, uh,  for an amount to be determined that will help us in turn generate that affordable housing stock.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"But I just want to let people know now, because they can address this issue, that there is language in this resolution that,  And I'll read that language right there that talks about developing a substantive affordable housing bonus program. In the resolution, it says, be it further resolved, [ORGANIZATION] instructs [ORGANIZATION] and ORG2 to include a workable affordable housing bonus for ORG3 consideration in implementing code for the final FAC0 plan. So this is really a daunting challenge, but it's a challenge I know that this council is up for.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,I know we all recognize... The need for more affordable housing as does [ORGANIZATION] But we need to actualize we need to activate the tools that will get us there beyond simply [ORGANIZATION] renewal money or federal government money or other sources at our disposal So we need to be creative and we're going to be serious and creative about that in the [LOCATION] quadrant and the central city plan Thank you.,portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"This just creates the possibility of potential.  possibly affording to relocate, making it worthwhile to reconsider the configuration of one of those or both of those ramps and be able to pay for it. The other thing about this, and this goes to a point that [ORGANIZATION] made very strongly, is that additional height here would be tied to a bonus. So you'd have to give something to get it, and as a waterfront location, it might have some particular value that can contribute to the affordable housing aspects of the bonus.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, two more issues. Affordable housing. The [ORGANIZATION] plan set a goal of having 15 percent of the housing stock affordable citywide and currently over 30 percent of the housing in the central city is affordable at the 80 percent median family income or less.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"So the [ORGANIZATION] set a very ambitious goal that by [ORGANIZATION], or in [ORGANIZATION], we're still going to have 30% of the housing in the central city affordable to 80% MFI or less households. The current city strategy targets affordable housing around opportunity areas, and the notion is that some of our neighborhoods are rich in transit, they're rich in good schools, they're rich in these things that for affordable housing areas,  residents, adds to likelihood of success and lowers their cost. And the planning commission sort of focused in on the fact that between the concentration of jobs and not just the concentration of jobs in general but the concentration of sort of working class jobs in the central city, concentration of transit, this is a great [STREET] to have affordable housing to save households money.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"We talked about [PERSON], and we talked about the [ORGANIZATION] plan, and [ORGANIZATION], a whole community displaced. And we talked about a huge deficit in affordable housing. So I previewed this question to you before the hearing because I was sincerely interested in getting your response.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"And I'm sure Commissioner [PERSON] is going to talk about that, too. So what I would really appreciate as we go through this is that you help us be as prescriptive as possible about what it's going to mean. Commissioner [PERSON] has put this voluntary bonus plan for affordable housing on the table.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,You've prioritized creating incentives for the development of family housing over preserving existing affordable housing. I don't know whether that's right. We know that a family housing is more expensive.,portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,I might want to preserve what we have because I suspect there's going to be a lot of pressure on the existing stock of affordable housing. And we know it takes an enormous focus to preserve preservation. vulnerable properties.,portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"And I have to add, as an urban planning geek, this is a really exciting time. [ORGANIZATION] shares the city's goal for this area of [PERSON], to be a healthy, thriving, and sustainable community that provides family-wage jobs, affordable housing, and recreation areas for all members of our community. And I come to you with two particular lenses beyond that conceptual continuation of our forward-thinking land-use planning policies and the urban growth boundary.",portland
02_04_2015,homelessness,"First, around housing more people in the core area. We support the plan's goals to allow for needed future residential development capacity for all income levels. As I mentioned, [ORGANIZATION], which is a partnership between cities of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], GPE2, [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2, is committed to providing an urgent and coordinated response to ending homelessness in our city and region.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"Our region's low vacancy rate, increasing rents, and lack of tools to increase the supply of affordable housing makes this work extremely difficult, as you know. Not only is downtown an attractive [STREET] to build a wide range of housing options, it is also a great [STREET] to wrap around those kinds of housing support services that we need to support families and individuals. In addition...  [ORGANIZATION] owns many public buildings and provides many public services in this project area, and we also receive property taxes from private property in the area.",portland
02_04_2015,homelessness,"And as we grow as a region over [ORGANIZATION], we know that well-designed, dense, mixed-use urban communities can promote livability, reduce transportation and housing costs, improve equity, and make our streets safer. And to Commissioner [PERSON]'s earlier point, they are also fundamental to our climate responsibilities. After the plan is adopted, [ORGANIZATION] looks forward to collaborating with the city on city-county priorities in the plan related to transportation, public safety, emergency management, housing and homelessness, and sustainability.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"We did not necessarily debate how to prioritize at all, not at the [ORGANIZATION] level. there's still some topic areas that need to be addressed in the plan such as the [ORGANIZATION] parking bonus system and this work will continue and it will come together to in when we complete the central city plan therefore the ORG1 recommends moving this plan forward with approval of the resolution thank you thank you PERSON0 [PERSON] playing sustainability chair uh mayor council before you DATE0 it's a major component of moving our central city forward  What you will hear are policies of how our downtown skyline may change and look, the importance of historical preservation, stronger environmental policies, recognition that parts of our downtown districts have unique character and need to be relative to their culture,  and a reaffirming and elevation of the affordable housing in our central city. And I'm going to recap kind of the deliberations, I think, or the high points, and then I'd like to touch on housing and talk a little more about that.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,what will it take to get more affordable housing in our downtown core and as a commission as the chair of the [ORGANIZATION] I think we're committed and I tell you I'm committed to bringing back something to you that says this is how we think we can get there it's going to be a tool box it's not one I don't think there's a crescent wrench in there that solves this problem,portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"If they go one by one, affordable housing and affordable offices will disappear, as well as the stories these buildings tell us.  us. We are in the middle of [ORGANIZATION]'s story. Without its beginning, the story will lose its shape and meaning, even its soul.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"but make investors drool. Committed to high-rise, [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] now have the least affordable housing in the world and a deteriorating public realm. When you permit very high-rise buildings, the huge potential profits inflate land prices.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"This jeopardizes historic buildings, [ORGANIZATION]'s heritage and historic identity and makes it increasingly difficult to ensure affordable market rate housing. And as research clearly demonstrates, high-rise is not suitable for many mothers, children, and elders, i.e., affordable housing. The supposed benefits for all income-level housing do not trickle down.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I ask the council to lower the maximum building height to 100 feet or less in [ORGANIZATION] and to preserve the historic buildings there. Research has verified that neighborhoods made up of small-scale buildings...  combined with older buildings, provide two important things. They provide affordable office space and affordable housing.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,Affordable office space supports locally owned business. What local shop owner can afford to rent in a new 400-foot glass tower? Affordable housing attracts younger residents.,portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"Not surprisingly, [ORGANIZATION]'s embrace of high towers was made possible by land use policies that attracted huge inflows of global monies, mostly from [ORGANIZATION]. Instead of fostering affordable housing and livable neighborhoods in [ORGANIZATION], this wave of high-rise construction created a glut of luxury housing for the very wealthy, many of them visitors from other lands,  and many occupying them only part-time. This oversupply of unaffordable housing has pushed ordinary [ORGANIZATION] citizens further into less affluent neighborhoods, including the city's downtrodden [PERSON], which is a druggy area.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,I'd be happy to share more of that with you. I do understand that tall buildings offer attractive profits.  particularly for affordable housing. That's a goal that I share very much as well.,portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"But I think we have to recognize the dangers in this kind of supply-side economic strategy, deregulating so that the wealth will trickle down to the rest of the city and to affordable housing and the other things that we want to do. In many cities around the world, the results of this strategy have been, to put it bluntly, dismaying. Some of my own research for [ORGANIZATION] has documented how global capital is currently flooding into high-rise projects and profoundly changing the character of cities around the globe.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"This is a neighborhood in an old-fashioned sense. I ask you to consider the treasured history of DATE0 GPE0 in [ORGANIZATION] existing buildings. Should the allowable heights specified in the draft FAC0 be adopted, the buildings that not only give the neighborhood character, but offer affordable housing to a large number of elderly on fixed incomes, [ORGANIZATION] students, and those of moderate means who work downtown, would over time give [STREET] to more costly housing and lead to gentrification.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"We'll talk about it more. Third, affordable housing is not being addressed in the proposed plan. We've heard about that a lot too.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"Is this dense housing? I think so. Third point, affordable housing is not being created or preserved in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"You've heard that a lot. The plan  The plan's housing goal is to preserve existing supply and continue to support development of existing housing, but there is nothing in the plan addressing preserving affordable housing and little substance to implement the goal other than developing tools to partner with the private development community.

Mayor, in your State of the City address and in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG1 interview, you mentioned height, bulk, and setbacks as important qualities of that compatibility.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"Create attractive, dense, high-quality, affordable housing throughout the central city that accommodates a broad range of needs, preferences, and financial capability in terms of different types, tenures, size, costs, and locations. That's great. Here's the sentence that was struck, which would actually greatly increase the impact of housing policy on the city, especially [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"provide a more diverse stock of housing to support a diversifying central city population that includes housing compatible with the needs of families with children, people with special needs, students, seniors, and the central city workforce. I believe that this is important language simply because it deals with more than the simplicity, overly simple aspect of providing so many units of affordable housing. It deals with size.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"There are no Chinese people in Chinatown. And I don't see, I understand about motivating affordable housing. I'm all for that.",portland
02_04_2015,affordable housing,"So when we're moving to commercial, we have to find the housing. I wonder if we could have a no net loss of affordable housing. Yeah.",portland
01_26_2017,affordable housing,"Item 86, adopt [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] Action Plan and direct staff to implement the investment strategies and outcomes identified in the action plan. So this is coming from the [ORGANIZATION], and we have [ORGANIZATION] here and some others.  to testify, but I've been provided a couple of overview points that I'd like to go ahead and share. Over [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION] was first established, many of the city's investments in [LOCATION] and [LOCATION]east have improved transportation infrastructure and transit access, revitalized neighborhood, and created new developments with both affordable housing and commercial developments.",portland
01_26_2017,affordable housing,"So our planning for [ORGANIZATION] began soon after the [ORGANIZATION] lift, which increased the affordable housing set-aside from 30% to 45% citywide. The impact in [ORGANIZATION], as you might recall, is more significant in that the remaining resources are now divided 70-[ADDRESS]. So 70% now goes to affordable housing, and 30% is available for other business and community development objectives.",portland
01_26_2017,affordable housing,"So you see here a reflection of the investments over [ORGANIZATION] where 73% or about $108 million will go into set-aside policy affordable housing and about 27% will go into business development, redevelopment, and infrastructure. This is in recognition of the fact that you have serious affordability challenges in this district, and so this is the area where we're seeing the most significant increase within the urban renewal area. So by the time the [ORGANIZATION] spending is completed, 50% of expenditures will have been invested in affordable housing and 50% to other development priorities.",portland
01_26_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you. And so within that program, it would be the expansion of the down payment assistance, also the expansion of single-family home repair,  And also expanded proposing a program by [ORGANIZATION] to support the development of accessory dwelling units and cottage homes to those with incomes between [ADDRESS] to begin to support multi-generational families.",portland
01_26_2017,affordable housing,"And so those dollars play out to be $1.6 million that would go towards down payment assistance, $1.6 million that would go towards the single-family home repair program, and then $1.8 million to go towards a proposed program to help with accessory dwelling units. Are there any structural or sideboards on particularly accessory dwelling units for obviously –  If they're rented out for [ORGANIZATION], that's more income for the homeowner, but it's also not really increasing our supply of affordable housing. So did you have some of those discussions in this, [ORGANIZATION]?",portland
01_26_2017,homeless,"When Commissioner [PERSON] mentioned [ORGANIZATION] over in [ORGANIZATION] area, I named my nonprofit organization [ORGANIZATION].  [PERSON] because there are so many homeless people that are good people, but they've had a divorce. They've lost a job. They've gotten on drugs.",portland
01_26_2017,homelessness,"Well, it was disappointing to me that none of the people who were yelling at us [ORGANIZATION] for doing nothing about housing and homelessness are not here, and particularly to hear that $32 million is not a lot of money. It is actually. And the $146.7 million over [LOCATION].",portland
01_10_2018,homeless,"It appears to me that the council is attempting to change the laws of physics by stating a home floating on a river is an impervious surface.

01_07_2015,homeless,"Some of our chronic homeless and camping issues, I can still vividly remember [TIME] being at FAC0 issuing multiple citations and taking a very enforcement approach at that time with very little consideration about where do people go or where do they need to go and how are their needs met. And I'm embarrassed by that because I think that was out of ignorance on my part. Thank you.",portland
01_07_2015,homelessness,"to not only get people into housing and the story of [ORGANIZATION] that we just heard and so many others, which I can relate on a personal level from our officers' experience, but I'm now able to direct our officers who are trying to balance community needs, criminal behavior with also people that are just in need of assistance or experiencing homelessness or mental health or drug and alcohol addiction, all the things that play into this. We're able to actually provide resources. DATE0 when I was out there, I didn't have any idea who existed and where to direct people.",portland
01_07_2015,homeless,"The homeless family system operates countywide. All right, but then why do you have city limits in there?",portland
01_07_2015,homeless,"Again, Commissioner [PERSON], I want to commend you on your efforts on this. Any money directed toward the homeless situation is positive in this city or [ORGANIZATION]. A concern I had originally on this is just to make sure that the funds for [ORGANIZATION], since they do also have a surplus...  are being paid from [ORGANIZATION] on the east side where it's necessary to do that.",portland
01_07_2015,homeless,We're making great changes pertaining to the homeless. I think we're making great strides. I think that we need to keep focusing on the addictions that a lot of people do have and  We need to offer better treatment.,portland
01_07_2015,homeless,I want it focused on the suicide prevention aspect of this. We need to understand that a high percentage of homeless people that are heroin addicts do commit suicide. It goes down the list of meth addicts.,portland
01_07_2015,homelessness,"They've been displaced out of their homes, from their jobs, from their friends, and when they're out on the sidewalks, out on the streets, they're looking for more positive solutions, which the speakers have stated they want to go in that direction. Again, Mayor, I'm going to compliment you on the bigger picture of homelessness because I was listening to a, it's called [ORGANIZATION]. It's where some of the founders of certain companies in other states go and have discussions.",portland
01_07_2015,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] at that meeting said that because of Mayor [PERSON], I'm looking at doing more things toward affordable housing and also the most vulnerable people in the city. That is the biggest direction that we need to have is people coming into this city, understanding if we talk shared economy, we need to also understand the homeless communities are part of the economy, and you begin to share that responsibility also. That's what was stated, and if we can continue to do that from the get-go, we're going to end chronic homelessness in this city, and we will maintain chronic homelessness.  chronic homelessness from [ORGANIZATION] and let these other services step in and provide the service they need.",portland
01_07_2015,homelessness,Ending chronic homelessness can be a reality with the right people brought in and the right resources from these other companies that are billion-dollar companies coming into this city and stating that they're listening to you close on the issues of homelessness. Thank you. Could you give us afterwards the reference to where this gentleman –  said what you've just quoted?,portland
01_07_2015,homelessness,"He stated that as a direction he'd like to look into to be part of the solutions through this city. There's no other commitments there, and I respect that he's at least thinking about it, looking at it, and determining how they want to spend the resources in this city. That changes the whole dynamics of homelessness through this city to have people do that before they enter with their businesses.",portland
01_07_2015,affordable housing,"Well, Commissioner [PERSON] has proposed we take 100 percent of the revenue from [ORGANIZATION] and we address affordable housing, which I support. And if the president of the company believes he wants to use some of his revenues –  to help address affordable housing, I think we could potentially have a marriage made in heaven. So I'll pull it up.",portland
01_07_2015,homelessness,"Your numbers might be a little bit high, but their intent to look at it and address those issues is one of the most positive things that we can have going forward in this city. And it will change the dynamics of ending chronic homelessness. Thank you.",portland
01_07_2015,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. And I don't know which is a more contentious phrase around here, [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION] versus the city of [PERSON] for the conduct of the [PERSON] [INSTITUTION]. But it was encouraging to hear the officers' words about improvements in interactions with homeless people and people in distress here.",portland
01_07_2015,homelessness,"Obviously, these funds need to be released. You need to vote yes on these items. We need to have a more comprehensive number and fact-based discussion that what happens with [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] at ORG2 and [PERSON] and [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_07_2015,homeless; homelessness,"I would like to address a few issues that I see, and what I see is from certain enforcement individuals, a culture of hate against people that are experiencing homelessness. And there's a brutality that is used to intimidate people  and more or less, I don't like to use the word, but terrorize people that are homeless. And I see this, and I see the effects of this, and this is not good.",portland
01_07_2015,homeless,But this has to stop. And I would also like to say that we should make it a hate crime for anybody to beat up on homeless people just because they're homeless. Yes.,portland
01_07_2015,homeless,"Money to the homeless, you know, it's not going to hurt them. There's certain things that people know what to do with money, and money is a shortage right now for people. People aren't going to be clamoring over the borders trying to get over here because it's so good for homeless folks.",portland
01_07_2015,affordable housing,"So we're not likely to see more federal dollars, and that's one of the reasons why I will support Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposal in the regular budget that we take $[ADDRESS] we're going to solve this problem is to increase the supply of affordable housing. There is a shortage. We must attack it from the point of view of adding to the supply, and I think [PERSON] has the right idea with the [ORGANIZATION], and I will support that during the budget cycle.",portland
01_07_2015,homelessness; houseless,"And when it's been pointed out that Commissioner [PERSON], who many of us think is sometimes being too pro-business, is honest and sincere enough to say, there's a supply problem, we have to make housing. So without talking to the latest concerns about  the budget overruns. I do want to say if we have massive 300% budget overruns or 200% budget overruns, I hope they always happen in providing homelessness to houseless and underhoused people in the future instead of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_07_2015,houseless,"We need people on the ground engaging people where they are. That means where houseless people are, where grassroots African-American youth are hanging out. And I love Judge [PERSON], but I don't think he's a grassroots outreach person.",portland

01_13_2016,affordable housing,"I think there's a lot that [ORGANIZATION] can do to help affordable housing more than has happened so far. So I hope that there's a role for the commission on that. And also a little thank you to our partners who are with us here, because this is a lot of time commitment.",portland
01_13_2016,affordable housing,Thank you.  very smart people. I think [ORGANIZATION] has provided me with lots of insights on how our comp plan can support affordable housing. And I hope we will address some of those issues when we adopt the comp plan.,portland
01_13_2016,homelessness,"So I think Judge [PERSON] has been very helpful in this latest decision, protecting First Amendment rights. There are a lot of things that the public can disagree on because if you're taking three-quarters of Americans are now paycheck to paycheck, three-quarters of Americans close to homelessness. I understand the pressures that you're under.",portland
01_13_2016,housing crisis,"So we are not actually addressing the documented area of need in our housing crisis, which is why I hope the legislature gives us the flexibility to address inclusionary housing. And I hope we don't take our eye off of...  providing housing for people that we have clear evidence they're being priced out of the marketplace, and that is certainly well below 80% MFI. Thank you.",portland
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION], for really being a bulldog around getting the multi-program to work. And that includes the amendments you brought to council to respond to some concerns we had from the development community. this is one of our most important tools and frankly it's not just an affordability tool it's a fair housing tool to ensure that we put affordable housing in high opportunity areas so thank you for your work on this PERSON1",portland
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"So by incorporation,  Encouraging this upzoning and the demolition, you're actually destroying density. You're losing affordable housing, and you're also losing this wonderful mix of historic structures that span a period from [ORGANIZATION] to have a monoculture of our 2.5 single-family houses, $700,000, 3,000 square feet plus. So the new zoning will encourage demolitions and is at odds with a determination of eligibility and a potential viable historic district, and with Goal 5 of [ORGANIZATION], which asks to conserve historic areas.",portland
01_13_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"In my opinion, the most critical issue in [ORGANIZATION] is that development is out of control. This is what is creating a lack of affordable housing and adding to homelessness. While development can be good for the city and create employment, uncontrolled development is not.",portland
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"There's all kinds of property that could be developed now. There's some money coming through for affordable housing. If you have to do an incentive to get some builders out there in that far reach of [ORGANIZATION], do it.",portland
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"If we don't get affordable housing, we're going to end up with a –  an exodus from [ORGANIZATION] that will mean we don't need those 300,000 rent units for people to live in because it's becoming unlivable, as you know, if you attended the concern about housing and lack of it. Think that apartments can be built and occupied within [ORGANIZATION] on FAC0 FAC1, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. And now that those funds are available, please use them to develop affordable housing in an area that is waiting for it and ready for it, [PERSON].",portland

In fact, 80% of my neighbors rent here  Nevertheless, [ORGANIZATION] and much of [PERSON] is experiencing a housing crisis with record low vacancy rates and an epidemic of displacement of long-term residents. As a renter threatened by displacement myself, I strongly support upzoning of plots adjacent to centers and quarters in the [ORGANIZATION] area,  and the inner southeast as a whole.",portland
01_13_2016,affordable housing,"You heard about the issues we've had with south of FAC0 before, and our main issues besides that would be that we would consider affordable housing impact statements as a policy, perhaps 5.45%.

01_14_2015,affordable housing,"So here we're coming into legal cannabis in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a little bit miffed that my [ORGANIZATION] research was destroyed by my non-profit affordable housing landlord you're partnering with, Commissioner [PERSON]. Halt at the dump.  along with my registered medical [PERSON].",portland
01_14_2015,affordable housing,"Affordable housing, nonprofit landlord has been keeping the apartment that they destroyed my research illegally. And you're partnering with the mayor? How am I supposed to feel good about this?",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"I'm PERSON0. I'm the Business Operations Manager for [ORGANIZATION], and I'm going to talk to you about our innovation project. Ours is about assisting homeless families",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"So our city has hundreds of homeless assistance programs operating on [ORGANIZATION]. Faith-based organizations are about a third of these programs, including the majority of food and substantial portion of all shelter and drop-in services. For example, at our faith-based summit that we had in [LOCATION], we had 15 churches participate.",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"Eight of those churches do hunger and food services on a [ORGANIZATION] basis, and nine of them provide some type of homeless service, either clothing, shelter, letting families park in their parking lots, a variety of things, which if we had not had that summit, we would not have known about what the services are. So despite the long history of them helping people in need, we know very little about what they're doing. And they serve primarily a diverse population.",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"Faith-based organizations have historically steered clear government because we require a lot of restraints and a lot of rules and things that they don't generally feel like they should have to –  to do in order to provide help to people. This innovation project aims to couple the specialized care and commitment provided by faith-based organizations serving the homeless with city services and housing resources. As part of the proposal, we'll appoint a staff member as a faith-based liaison to work with churches to develop a data and information sharing program.",portland
01_14_2015,homelessness,"And this second portion was recommended by [ORGANIZATION], who was working with the city on the ORG1 projects [ORGANIZATION]. This project aims to create a new relationship contributing new information to the city's efforts to reduce and end homelessness. It will contribute new knowledge about the needs of [ORGANIZATION] residents and the strategies to best meet those needs.",portland
01_14_2015,homeless; homelessness,"So that's a fair answer. Now, one of the things that I like about this, and I'm referring mainly on the homelessness on the data sharing, what I'd like to see possibly is more data on more of a [ORGANIZATION] count of people that are homeless, say, on a [LOCATION] basis out through the city. But why I mention that is I want to see more of a,  maybe a more of a sophisticated system set up to where we really monitor that number.",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"And I'm talking about where people get their food, if they're chronically homeless outside. I want to have that data to really understand that number, how it's changing, how it's changing with the population, with people moving out of the state, people moving into the state, etc.  I really want that number to even be broken down to central downtown, east side, certain areas by the block. I want that number accessed.",portland
01_14_2015,homelessness,"PERSON0? Good [TIME], Commissioners. I'm glad that [PERSON] retouched on the issue of –  homelessness.",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"I know that it's a difficult issue for to find funding in places, you know, there are federal restrictions. We really, we kind of know that we just need more units and Commissioner [PERSON] and all of you have worked to take steps in that direction. [TIME] I was particularly aware of which doorways already had people asleep prior towards [TIME] and I hope that  [ORGANIZATION] we might have some capacity to directly approach people and engage, have a facility where we can actually rescue people and actually just accost people and actually be glad that some homeless people, all they want to do is rest.",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"He's not the chief, and I don't have his card. I have a couple other people's information that I gathered. But I was concerned because I live in a downtown [ORGANIZATION] area, and there are a lot of homeless people that live in that area that I live in, and I think I proposed to you to really come out there on the streets and hang out with me for a [ORGANIZATION] or two.",portland
01_14_2015,homelessness,"I think everything happened for a reason in this life. If I had not been there for her and her being there for me, I wouldn't still be here because she was the person that encouraged me to continue to keep going with this movement. And as I've been a part of it, it's just been so many touching factors to what's going on with our population of people of homelessness, of mental illness, and all of these different things in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_14_2015,homeless,"And it's just so hurtful that I'm collecting data. I'm advocating for homeless people at this point. And I'm setting up a space for them to come because they're not going to come down here with all their luggage and everything that they have, you know, to talk to someone that they don't know that really haven't done nothing for them.",portland
01_14_2015,homeless; homelessness,"And there's several pictures. I'm compiling a documentary about the homeless people,  you know the hiddenness behind homelessness and it's not always about a person being an addict you know people want help in this city but if they're having to be out on the [STREET] and women have to get with the man that they don't know just to have a pallet to lay down and i could get to go to a warm bed [TIME] mayor that's not right for me thank you so much for being here and for coming forward and being an advocate thank you",portland
01_09_2019,houseless,"DATE0, I've learned a lot in [LOCATION] because I'm now more involved with helping friends in [ORGANIZATION]. What I learned...  ever since a couple city councils ago, was that the new response is that a notice will be posted in a certain amount of time before any houseless camp is swept away. Before DATE2, there was supposed to be a sweep [DATE] before DATE2 in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_09_2019,homeless,"Thank you. Thank you. Okay, what I want to say is the hallmarks of this project where you go in and you consult with the property owners, they are afforded –  that homeless people are not, and that is the right to be seen as a person before the law.",portland
01_09_2019,homeless,"And when you're confronted with an engineering problem and transportation is very important and how it's all done is very important and how it affects people is very important, when you're talking about  social services and lack of housing and things that impact the homeless, you don't consult the homeless to find out what's going on with them and where the rubber is not meeting the [STREET] or how they're affected. And [ORGANIZATION]  If you do not know where I was [ORGANIZATION] and what I was doing, you won't know what I was talking about, but I went up to your office on [LOCATION] and I left a detailed record.",portland
01_09_2019,homeless,"And I'm talking about...  homeless people who are affected by the services that don't exist or do  exist on paper but don't exist in reality and just the dysfunction of that. And here you were able to work with the property owners. If you worked more with homeless people in terms of directly in conversation with them about what works and what doesn't and what's on paper that  pretends to be there and is not there, you would have a more functional system.",portland
01_09_2019,homeless,"Like, you got this system to work because you consulted the property owners. If you don't talk directly with homeless people, you're never going to fix the homeless problem. So [ORGANIZATION] might be surprised to hear, and thank you for your testimony, you might be surprised to hear I agree with you",portland
01_09_2019,homelessness,"And I do, in fact, spend a considerable amount of time meeting with, talking with, sharing, going to, and being present to understand the situation of people who are directly impacted by homelessness. So I appreciate that. I can, you know, if you read what I wrote to you, my written communication, you will see that services are called, you know, at the exact time and under the exact condition that are prescribed, and they do absolutely nothing.",portland
01_09_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you. And then...  In a desire to also try to talk in plain English, the advantage that we would have is that we could possibly build more affordable housing or use the other resources that we have. We'll have more resources that we could then invest, right?",portland
01_09_2019,affordable housing,"As a result of that, and as a result of some advocacy by people like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and others,  We actually got a more robust investment in affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], which was one of the dividends. But we also made a commitment to continue to partner with [ORGANIZATION] on shared use facilities. And an issue that I believe predated all of us on council was the urban center.  which was put together by very creative people in terms of financing and had money from all kinds of different pots.",portland
01_09_2019,homeless,"I'm not the biggest enthusiasm of everybody that lives in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, but any low-income people that live in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, if they're going to get anything out of this, they should have access to an expanded community garden on these grounds that we're displacing homeless people from,  During, well, the talk is happening now, during [ORGANIZATION] when we're going to have the [STREET] and time count, and find out that what we have failed to do is keep this homeless village situated where it should have remained and increase the number of homeless villages throughout the city so we have less tarps being blown around in windstorms like we experienced [LOCATION], etc., As to whether there might be offered bicycle use there or something like that and costs, I think that given the location of the facility, if we're going to have any talk about any other use other than an expanded community garden for people in the overlooked neighborhood area and anybody that wants to commute to that area along the bike path,  you know, any funding for fancy bike uses or whatever, which should be a conversation that really comes after either [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] have talked to us about how much money they're willing to name this path [PERSON]. If they don't want to spend money to name it [PERSON], then it's just going to be a multi-use path that helps people get to community gardens.",portland

Well, what's going on here, in a more monitored situation with homeless people or homeless encampments, these things might not happen, where you have homeless people just kind of loosely around, doing things in the corner, stabbing each other or whatever.

01_24_2018,affordable housing,This policy supports efforts in the [ORGANIZATION] plan and in the inclusionary housing policy and upcoming housing policy to build more affordable housing and to meet our climate goals. This is a foundation.

01_24_2018,affordable housing,"So [PERSON] is right. If you sign off on something like that, you're creating the problem. And the issue with that is that in neighborhoods that are already being extremely heavily gentrified, and the cost of housing is skyrocketing, and the residential infill project does not contain contingencies for actual affordable housing, which [ORGANIZATION], you've pointed out before with certain projects of building in the city is a constant issue.",portland
01_24_2018,affordable housing,"It's handled by the same department that wrote the ticket to begin with, which is handled by the city that created the problem to begin with. So it's like you're adding the salt to the wound for those that are being gentrified out, for those whose neighborhoods are being taken over by this density project.

Over [ORGANIZATION], that has been an increasingly difficult thing to do. We have tens of thousands of very low-income households who are already rent-burdened, paying 50%, 60%, 70% or more of their very limited income toward rent.",portland
02_02_2017,homelessness,"In my previous work at [ORGANIZATION], we routinely had people on long-term disability bringing in less than $800 a month who were paying as much as 100% of that income toward rent. In that situation, any little thing that went wrong could put them back on the [STREET]. When those extremely rent-burdened families have a temporary interruption in income or an unplanned expense, they face homelessness.",portland
02_02_2017,affordable housing,"Unless their incomes increase proportionate to rent, which is not happening for the low-income people in our community, they will eventually lose their housing. And while in this market finding alternative affordable housing units is a challenge, [ORGANIZATION] has about one affordable unit for every five extremely low-income households who need one, finding replacement housing is only the first challenge. Once a family has found a unit, they too often can't come up with the several thousand dollars in [ORGANIZATION] rent and deposit that landlords are requiring to get into units.",portland
02_02_2017,homeless,"The result? In too many cases, families that receive excessive rent increases or no-cause evictions can't find and raise the funds to get into alternative housing in time, and they become homeless. That explains why, even as with expanded city and county investments, we've helped a record number of people with prevention assistance and helped a record number of people get back into permanent housing, over 4,600 people [ORGANIZATION].",portland

02_02_2017,homeless,"Compare that to [ORGANIZATION], where they received less than half as many housing-related calls, and those calls made up just 22% of their inquiries. When we look at the homeless system as a whole, we find that a significant majority of the people receiving shelter and housing assistance are new to the system, meaning they haven't accessed services in [LOCATION]. And our shelters are reporting high percentages of families who have never been homeless before.",portland

02_02_2017,homeless,No-cause evictions are simply the most common reason given by families coming into our shelter [TIME]. So we're seeing a huge influx of families coming into the [INSTITUTION]. Most of them are saying they received a no-cause eviction.,portland

Every opportunity they have to succeed in school, to form healthy friendship bonds, to advance physical and emotional health in a positive [STREET], all of those opportunities are destroyed.",portland
02_02_2017,homelessness,"The key thing to note is that using a no-cause eviction in a situation in which a for-cause is called for is an end run around the due process of the tenant.

02_02_2017,affordable housing,"They will become owner-occupied, thereby removing these units from the rental pool.

01_16_2019,homelessness,"In the previous discussions, it was a $40 million contribution to the [ORGANIZATION], $40 million for additional P5 needs. There was money in there for Expo as well as the homelessness services. We need to get back to the table to talk about those.",portland
01_16_2019,homeless,"So Chair PERSON0 and I met DATE0. Okay. And while there's no guarantees, I think we are all committed to getting to yes on an agreement that puts forward those resources for services related to our permanent supportive housing and chronic homeless service continuum.",portland
01_16_2019,homelessness,"But I want to say  state on the record that homelessness is absolutely related to tourism and that this is a legitimate use of these dollars. Tourism is a driver of gentrification, displacement, and unaffordability. There is a 94% correlation, or I should say there is an overwhelming correlation between unaffordability and homelessness.",portland
01_16_2019,homeless,"And tourism has a major role to play in that. We hear from the tourism industry and businesses who depend on tourist dollars, the impact that our homeless crisis is having on them. And while as a business owner I can certainly understand their concerns and sympathize to a certain degree, we need them to recognize that they are part of the problem and that we need to devote dollars to mitigating the impact of tourism on our housing and homeless communities.",portland
01_16_2019,homeless,"And again, testimony must be germane to the subject at hand. Okay, it doesn't matter how many dollars you allot to housing, homeless, social services, if...  the people that you put in [STREET] are not connected to the agencies that can help them. The quote-unquote social worker who has no education or training in social work and cannot connect this man at the library to any social agencies and will not because he's complaining about his pay, that it's above his pay grade.",portland
01_16_2019,homeless,You're talking about dollars for housing and homeless services. You're talking about an ordinance that would allocate $2 million of the...  visitors development fund for the purpose of investing in a shell at one of our performance centers that is what we are discussing okay but if you don't have the workers that can connect people to these services that have the training and ability  you're giving money to [ORGANIZATION].,portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"Through this engagement, more than 1,000 people provided meaningful input. I'd like to recognize [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION], and everyone who helped shape this engagement and encouraged robust participation. Through this engagement, we heard specific recommendations like those you see reflected here for affordable housing or active community space.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"Building on the framework plan, our vision includes a firm commitment to 720 affordable housing units, in the site and adjacent to the district's central amenities. We've planned for community space for programming and for public art that will honor and reflect the history of this neighborhood while celebrating and empowering [ORGANIZATION]'s diverse communities. We've committed to creating opportunities that foster wealth creation for diverse local businesses and to pursuing property investment and ownership structures to increase asset development for communities of color.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"We are deeply appreciative of the partners that have walked with us thus far. We want to recognize the enormous investment of time and talent by our city partners from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], ORG6, and ORG7. From an affordable housing strategy to planning for open space, the green loop or [STREET] designs, to detailed engineering and financing discussions about utility upgrades, construction or procurement for the city's infrastructure investments.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"Since [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2 have met to negotiate a community benefits agreement that will reflect both public and private commitments. We are currently working on reaching tentative agreement on a term sheet that would speak to construction equity, operations, affordable housing, sustainability, business equity, teneting and oversight. And finally, public infrastructure and affordable housing land transfer commitments will be executed via individual intergovernmental agreements, and these agreements will detail funding and finance responsibilities by public and private partners, relevant elements of the community benefits agreements and delivery expectations.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] will speak separately to the capital required to deliver on affordable housing, so that's not included in this chart. The yellow portion that is currently [ORGANIZATION] represents those particular community benefits that will require additional investment with tools outside of the city or private sectors conventional means. And will need to be found from either land sales, being invested in these community benefits, or bringing other additional resources to bear.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"And then [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] will hold hearings on the master plan and will bring the key development disposition agreement, community benefits agreement, and intergovernmental agreement term sheets to you for your consideration. We're also moving forward with the interim activation plan, relocating the ORG1 retail to the adjacent garage, and pursuing demolition of the vacant buildings. So with that, I'd like to hand it over to ORG2 to discuss the affordable housing strategy.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"The affordable housing we create will be for families who make less than 60% of area median income. For a three person family, that would mean a household who makes less than 47,000 or [DATE]. That would be housing that's affordable for people like preschool teachers, service workers, or seniors on a fixed income.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is committed to achieving 720 units of affordable housing within the [ORGANIZATION] corridor. The strategy to achieve this goal is twofold. First, to provide land and ORG1 financing to affordable housing owners and developers.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"And secondly, to use inclusionary housing. Market rate developers within the corridor will be bound to meet their inclusionary housing requirements at 60% of area median income. While the number of units to be created through direct financing and inclusionary housing has fluxed over time, our commitment to create 720 units of affordable housing has remained constant.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"Guided by these values, we selected an entire city block alongside the new park in the heart of the corridor to create two separate and distinct new developments. This parcel selection also has the benefit of ensuring we can create affordable housing in the first phase of development. In combination, we believe this block will allow for the creation of 440 units of affordable housing.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"In addition to this block, with input from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and ORG2 have identified two additional parcels for affordable housing development. ORG3 has offered to co-develop the FAC0 parcel in a mixed-use development or alternatively to use a portion of the ORG3-owned site at FAC1 Based on current market assumptions and the present plan for development of market rate units in the corridor, we estimate that ORG2 will be contributing just over 30% of the overall financing needed to reach our 720-unit goal, with private capital contributing approximately 70% of the total cost. Thank you.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"We do anticipate as soon as we are able to put out the southern portion, which is largely residential, we would anticipate that there will be, in addition to local affordable housing developers, that there will be other developers who will come in. [ORGANIZATION] has not expressed an interest in the southern part of it, and so I think you're gonna see a mixture. Just know that I'm going to continue to ask that question every time you come to me with this project, okay?",portland
01_30_2020,homeless,"Because for us, we say it was not as the mayor said, it was not about the project, it was not about the building or the development, it was always centered and focused on the people. particularly people that usually doesn't benefit from these projects. We listen construction workers, business owners, displaced residents, homeless, people with disabilities, kids.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"We're also looking forward to the following components of the vertical construction of the project, specifically affordable housing. Affordability continues to be a concern for [ORGANIZATION] for our members and for communities of color in [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] Housing Bureau's own state of housing report states, there are no neighborhoods in [ORGANIZATION] affordable to single moms or to black families.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"Given the history of intentional displacement of indigenous, black, Chinese, and Japanese residents from this area, and given the city's recent acknowledgement of that intentional displacement, we at the [ORGANIZATION] are also advocating for a racial preference to be considered for the housing units as a concrete step toward remediating these historic injustices. We affirm our ability to problem solve when we build intentional relationships with one another. We affirm our values as a community that's committed to racial justice, which is demonstrated through clear definitions of good quality jobs and maximizing the opportunities to build affordable housing and for businesses.",portland
01_30_2020,affordable housing,"In fact, if it's done right and it's done with those supports to small firms and it really is truly important for us to lift up those wages for all folks. I mean, when I think about the, conversation about affordable housing and the folks that we serve and the fastest [STREET] for them to get secure housing and to be you know fully living in this community and thriving is through a good job with a good wage and benefits we are not going to do that if we continue to low [STREET] All right. And we're happy to follow up and provide that research and have additional conversations if that's beneficial.",portland
01_30_2020,housing crisis,"The effect of that is to create a permanent use, which is really what they want, [ORGANIZATION] is more than generous, and we would have to be concerned about the precedent then. PERSON0 and I have not really argued the legal case that was made before the hearings officer. This is not really an allowable conditional use, but allowing it would be a precedent for converting housing stock to office use in the city, which is about the worst thing we could do in light of the current housing crisis.",portland

In [ORGANIZATION], the council wasted precious time trying to shut me down, my voice, the voices of all activists in [ORGANIZATION], that the houseless suffered all the [STREET] to their deaths.

The city council will continue to applaud itself for doing the least rather than the most, and people will continue to die.

01_03_2018,affordable housing,"One is an unusually high number of retirements.  partly because of people aging out of their positions, partly because of uncertainty around PERS. There's a whole host of reasons, but we have had a tremendous brain drain, which we are now in the process of hiring for. Second, as my colleagues know, there was a huge crush of work [ORGANIZATION] at the development services, in part because of concerns that under proposed changes to federal law, certain things would be forfeited, particularly in the area of affordable housing development.",portland
01_03_2018,homeless,"If they really need case management because they are homeless and they have no identification, they haven't had regular access to health care, our case manager focuses on that.

02_08_2017,homeless,"It was also struck down. PERSON0, right here in federal [STREET], said that to sweep when the shelter is full is cruel and unusual punishment, which contravenes the Constitution, which you're sworn to uphold. Another issue I have is the homeless count.",portland

Over there in the county, she said that they put 2,000 people in housing [ORGANIZATION].",portland
02_08_2017,homeless,"So obviously, the count of the homeless is woefully inadequate by a factor of five. So if you want to solve a problem, you have to understand the magnitude of the problem. There are 12,000 people on the streets.",portland

First off, in a subtle yet important [STREET], [PERSON] used to provide a third option to those homeless people besides being criminalized outside or treated like prisoners in missions. Secondly, consider that perhaps where the ORG2 went wrong is that they, like everywhere else, they tried to build walls and give people privacy.",portland
02_08_2017,homeless,"Now, I love homeless people, but...  There's a reason why many missions don't put doors on the front of their bathroom stalls.

02_08_2017,homelessness,"And mostly that magical space sitting in the vertical direction above our heads at [TIME] has gone entirely unused, meaning the rent has not been divided by two.

But that doesn't mean that we don't have policy options.",portland
02_18_2015,homeless,"If that's not a crisis, I don't know what is. This kind of dismal economic reality doesn't just impact the low-wage workers themselves.

That's what was stated, and if we can continue to do that from the get-go, we're going to end chronic homelessness in this city, and we will maintain chronic homelessness.  chronic homelessness from [ORGANIZATION] and let these other services step in and provide the service they need.",portland
01_07_2015,homelessness,Ending chronic homelessness can be a reality with the right people brought in and the right resources from these other companies that are billion-dollar companies coming into this city and stating that they're listening to you close on the issues of homelessness. Thank you. Could you give us afterwards the reference to where this gentleman –  said what you've just quoted?,portland
01_07_2015,homelessness,"He stated that as a direction he'd like to look into to be part of the solutions through this city. There's no other commitments there, and I respect that he's at least thinking about it, looking at it, and determining how they want to spend the resources in this city. That changes the whole dynamics of homelessness through this city to have people do that before they enter with their businesses.",portland
01_07_2015,affordable housing,"Well, Commissioner [PERSON] has proposed we take 100 percent of the revenue from [ORGANIZATION] and we address affordable housing, which I support. And if the president of the company believes he wants to use some of his revenues –  to help address affordable housing, I think we could potentially have a marriage made in heaven. So I'll pull it up.",portland
01_07_2015,homelessness,"Your numbers might be a little bit high, but their intent to look at it and address those issues is one of the most positive things that we can have going forward in this city. And it will change the dynamics of ending chronic homelessness. Thank you.",portland
01_07_2015,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. And I don't know which is a more contentious phrase around here, [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION] versus the city of [PERSON] for the conduct of the [PERSON] [INSTITUTION]. But it was encouraging to hear the officers' words about improvements in interactions with homeless people and people in distress here.",portland
01_07_2015,homelessness,"Obviously, these funds need to be released. You need to vote yes on these items. We need to have a more comprehensive number and fact-based discussion that what happens with [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] at ORG2 and [PERSON] and [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_07_2015,homeless; homelessness,"I would like to address a few issues that I see, and what I see is from certain enforcement individuals, a culture of hate against people that are experiencing homelessness. And there's a brutality that is used to intimidate people  and more or less, I don't like to use the word, but terrorize people that are homeless. And I see this, and I see the effects of this, and this is not good.",portland
01_07_2015,homeless,But this has to stop. And I would also like to say that we should make it a hate crime for anybody to beat up on homeless people just because they're homeless. Yes.,portland
01_07_2015,homeless,"Money to the homeless, you know, it's not going to hurt them. There's certain things that people know what to do with money, and money is a shortage right now for people. People aren't going to be clamoring over the borders trying to get over here because it's so good for homeless folks.",portland
01_07_2015,affordable housing,"So we're not likely to see more federal dollars, and that's one of the reasons why I will support Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposal in the regular budget that we take $[ADDRESS] we're going to solve this problem is to increase the supply of affordable housing. There is a shortage. We must attack it from the point of view of adding to the supply, and I think [PERSON] has the right idea with the [ORGANIZATION], and I will support that during the budget cycle.",portland
01_07_2015,homelessness; houseless,"And when it's been pointed out that Commissioner [PERSON], who many of us think is sometimes being too pro-business, is honest and sincere enough to say, there's a supply problem, we have to make housing. So without talking to the latest concerns about  the budget overruns. I do want to say if we have massive 300% budget overruns or 200% budget overruns, I hope they always happen in providing homelessness to houseless and underhoused people in the future instead of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_07_2015,houseless,"We need people on the ground engaging people where they are. That means where houseless people are, where grassroots African-American youth are hanging out. And I love Judge [PERSON], but I don't think he's a grassroots outreach person.",portland
01_10_2018,homeless,"It appears to me that the council is attempting to change the laws of physics by stating a home floating on a river is an impervious surface. Specifically around the roof, yes, but everything that falls on the roof immediately goes into the river. Raising the costs of homeownership and renters, many who are on fixed incomes, will only make the problem of the ongoing homeless crisis worse, as many of these people are being directly impacted by this raise.",portland
02_12_2020,homeless,"First off, I have to commend you for your composure. So DATE0 I'm here again to talk about the Yes, [ORGANIZATION], The Homeless Cure. And how I plan to socially and financially support the 400 acre lifestyle farm.",portland
02_12_2020,homeless,"Before I begin, I would like to call attention to the importance of the plan. This plan has the capability to house and rehabilitate over 7,000 homeless and underachievers in [ORGANIZATION]. The only worthy plan out there is FAC0, and they can hold up to 100 per night and up to 300 in [LOCATION].",portland
02_12_2020,homeless,"Their 1,500 compared to this 7,000 plan is gigantic. And then if you add that we have 38,000 homeless on top of that, What we have in order right now, what we're working on right now, can't even house the increase, let alone the existing 38,000. So obviously, we're in big trouble over that.",portland
02_12_2020,homeless; homelessness,"So [PERSON] and you, the city, could adapt this plan, [ORGANIZATION], so that we can assure to end homelessness and not just provide another shelter, but rehabilitation as well. I think that they would marry well together. As I've mentioned before, I'm looking for just the right groups or individuals to lead and support and end to [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless crisis.",portland
02_12_2020,homeless,"Also non-profits, individuals like [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], which you'll see coming up in your mailings for several walks in the downtown, very friendly walks about just recognizing the need to really take this on head on and fix this issue. The business partners can open satellite stores within the village, offering on-the-job training in personal and trade skills. These newly gained trade skills will become a part of the villagers' employment resumes.",portland
02_12_2020,homeless,"Philanthropists and foundations and people who are passionate about helping people in need fundraise and donate. Finally, [ORGANIZATION]. The challenge group consists of everyone who works, lives, or plays in the downtown.",portland
02_12_2020,homelessness,"These groups will be asked to contact and gather their brothers and sisters to join in the walk against homelessness. Now, how can the government help? I ask that you suspend your present efforts towards homelessness, saving millions, and shift those dollars to mental health and addiction.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"FAC0 and [ORGANIZATION], a lot that I have. There was an old hotel located there [ORGANIZATION]. I just want to share with you the site, with you again, for any housing needs, like short-term housing for camps like FAC1 or future long-term affordable housing units.",portland
02_12_2020,homelessness,"Some bureaus may not have, even if they have revenue, they may not have sources of funding that allow them to use it for this purpose. And so there might be, we're also recommending that [ORGANIZATION] may set additional eligibility and priorities and that bureaus can further set them unique to their situation. They could include for example people who do not have bus passes from work or school, people who have experienced homelessness or houselessness and people who do not have flexible work schedules.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,Are you housing cost burdened? Do you live in regulated affordable housing? Do you qualify for food stamps?,portland
02_12_2020,homeless,"Are you homeless? Yes. are just a few off the top of my head that I think would be very reasonable criteria for receiving stipends. And then, now I've lost track of those five questions that you wanted us, okay.",portland
02_12_2020,housing crisis; affordable housing,I feel that the arguments around livability and Title X are really grasping at straws. They're not meaningful to me whatsoever. We have an affordable housing crisis.,portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"One house and let it be used for a non-residential purpose. One house that I don't know probably is worth $800,000 to a million dollars which is not going to provide anyone affordable housing is just not compelling to me. So I continue to support Commissioner [PERSON]'s motion.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"This is going to allow non-profit and for-profit developers to build affordable housing in some of the city's most resource-rich neighborhoods. It's very important to me that we support family-sized affordable housing, so I'm glad to see that that's a possibility there. In their letter, [ORGANIZATION] asked us for this bonus as well as [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] waivers and property tax exemptions.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"So I'm happy to see this progress on their request. [ORGANIZATION] also asked us to explore a fee in lieu for the deeper affordability bonus, focusing funds on affordable infill development and generating revenue from underdevelopment to build more affordable housing. So I would like to ask [PERSON] to look into these ideas further and meet with my staff as the amendment develops before it comes back to council.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"From the beginning I was told that this was not an affordable housing program. That [ORGANIZATION] was about creating middle housing. And for [ORGANIZATION] we've been having this conversation, we've been very clear about that this project, I'm concerned, quite frankly, that it's not enough units for [ORGANIZATION] to actually be able to, unless they have a... like a block that they are going to be able to get the return on the investment.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"I'm very concerned that we're trying to take a model that was not intended to provide affordable housing and squeeze affordable housing into it. The [STREET] we do it now is if you've got 40 units and four of them would have to be affordable based on our current criteria, I just don't know what we expect, how we expect to get... a good mix of affordable housing if we're going to be doing it one house at a time. Right?",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,And trying to create an affordable housing bonus inside a program that was very specifically about middle income housing. I think that's a disservice. It promises something that we will not be able to deliver in our lifetime.,portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"And I'm much more interested in how do we make sure that we're building housing that people can afford to live in as compared to a couple here, a couple there. We need a lot more housing, and this is not going to get us to affordable housing or housing people can afford to live in. So I do not think this is a good amendment.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"We heard this concept expressed by several community organizations, including affordable housing developers. And we also have a strong precedent in terms of adopting a similar amendment in better housing by design. And personally, I think it's important to keep the better housing by design and [ORGANIZATION] in alignment.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"In my opinion, this concept offers a needed flexible approach for supporting developers who are being building affordable, and I would use capital A affordable housing throughout the city. While I'd like to see the concept define MFI at the lowest end of the income spectrum as possible, I also have to acknowledge that funding and financing options are limited and complicated for affordable housing development. Because of this, I do support the tiered approach, 60% MFI for [ORGANIZATION] for rental or 80% MFI for DATE1 ownership units.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"Affordable housing developers such as [ORGANIZATION] have asked for this and said that they can build more housing with it And other than waiving fees for these affordable housing developers, I don't believe there's a cost to the city. Am I wrong? No, as the mayor said, the pro forma, if you look at the – PERSON0 with [ORGANIZATION], excuse me – All of these, both the 80% and the 60%, are going to take finance being brought by the nonprofit developer typically to deliver the unit.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"I mean it would just be a missed opportunity to not try to serve the needs of affordable housing developers and even some private developers. I actually heard from a constituent recently whose he and his father is a landlord and kind of small-time developers, been doing that for [ORGANIZATION]. So they own some cheap dirt.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"They're not spending $250,000 on an empty lot, and they're committed to affordable housing, and they thought that this incentive wouldn't be available to private developers, which I understand it is. It's just we don't think many of them will take advantage of it. That's correct.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON]. I would appreciate that because after [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION], who builds affordable housing for very low income families, I know what it takes for nonprofits to actually put a funding package together. And with few exceptions, I think it's a little challenging when you're talking about such few units because of how the financing works.",portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,It's not the affordable housing solution. It's just a tool that nonprofits could use. And in 43% of the city.,portland
02_12_2020,affordable housing,"When [ORGANIZATION] ruled, I think in [ORGANIZATION], that it was unconstitutional to deny the sale of real estate to someone based on race, we saw cities across the country implement zoning codes and zoning codes became a proxy. Well, income became a proxy for race. And so I do think that there's an important [STREET] in this conversation for affordable housing.",portland
01_07_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"In addition, that's when the bill stack will be introduced, so we'll have [ORGANIZATION] before the official kickoff of the session on [LOCATION] to really be able to dig through some of these pieces of legislation and what their impacts will be on the city. so turning first to the federal agenda the report you have before you is substantially similar to what was considered at the work session and includes that feedback that you provided to at the work session and subsequent to the to the session so the drafts have also been available on our website for public review there are eight top priorities leading with housing and homelessness  Two new priorities were added at your request, including gun violence prevention and federal protected sick time. So just going through the change memo you have before you, on page one of the agenda, the affordable housing section was amended to include a request of the administration so that local governments and we can have more flexibility about how we administer federal housing programs.",portland
01_07_2016,homelessness,"And then on page seven, the domestic violence prevention item was updated to include a piece on preventing homelessness among victims of domestic violence. And lastly, a new item was added urging [ORGANIZATION] ratification of [ORGANIZATION], the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. So that's just a quick overview of the changes since the work session.",portland
01_07_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,Just a couple concerns I have on this is that one of the issues that I have on the climate change is obvious issues.  that we want to divest in fossil fuel extraction companies. But I want to have a clear understanding that I want to start thinking more on where are we going to invest that money. And what I want to have an understanding is that I want to see divestment in fossil fuel extraction companies and investment in the affordable housing and homelessness companies.,portland
01_07_2016,homelessness,"And I want to get thinking on that to start figuring out how we can do that with certain investment vehicles that will enable us to do that in the future. And why I say that, I want a smooth transitioning over from fossil fuel industry, but I also want to create jobs, create housing, and also decrease homelessness. And I want a little bit more thought put into that if I could possibly have that.",portland
01_07_2016,homelessness,"So hello again and with me is [ORGANIZATION] our state government relations manager and [ORGANIZATION] our senior associate and Turning to the state legislative agenda again The draft is very similar to what was brought to you for the at the [ORGANIZATION] work session on  Again, the top priority in the state agenda is housing and homelessness. The four items in this priority, beginning with lifting the preemption on inclusionary zoning, request that the state give [ORGANIZATION] more authority to address needs locally and that they not further intrude on local decision-making.",portland
01_07_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], I have a question on page one under affordable housing and homelessness. Under the lifting the preemption on inclusionary zoning, my sense is that we need to give you as broad a charge as possible since there's a lot of moving pieces here. Okay.",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"So in terms of the policies, there are a few that I think I would like to at least bring your attention to. 2C, use community benefits agreement as an anti-displacement tool that would help engage the community early to create developer agreements that benefit community members. 3C, create permanently affordable housing in market rate developments.",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Man, DATE0 we look at these high rises go up. Is it possible that we could say that maybe 20 or 30 percent of those developments could be affordable housing to give some of our people that have been pushed out an opportunity to either come back and other folks who live in this area the opportunity to stay?",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"We ask that you do this for [ORGANIZATION] because this is the community that belongs to us all and the kind of [STREET] that we say we want to live requires that we do certain things to reach our goals together. To do so, all of these policies or tools must be supported and in [STREET]. This means allowing funding streams to tie affordable housing to job training and placement through community benefit agreements, CBAs.",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"Density, apartment buildings without required parking and skinny houses by themselves don't solve affordable housing needs. Just ask my staff who work blocks from here but live in the numbers. Chapter three of the comp plan calls for coordinated housing, economic development and public facility plans and investments to create an integrated community development approach to restore communities impacted by past decisions.",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,I want you to vote to restore and strengthen communities harmed by gentrification and displacement. I want you to vote to expand access to affordable housing city wide. I want you to vote to make [ORGANIZATION] great.,portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"In this spirit, we must remind the city that increasing density without also proactively preventing displacement and better supporting tenants in this city would simply reproduce the injustices of the past. As such,  As such, we continue to support policies that incentivize the construction of affordable housing units and much stronger renter protections as a whole. A city that depends on growing through displacing working persons of color and families and its most vulnerable residents cannot in any sense of the word call itself sustainable.",portland
01_07_2016,homeless,"I'm a [ORGANIZATION] native [ORGANIZATION] resident who lived [PERSON] of my life in stable, secure homes.

01_07_2016,homeless,"I have worked the front lines holding several positions serving the homeless population, at-risk youth, those with addictions, along with the mentally and physically disabled for [ORGANIZATION]. I have worked in social services for [ORGANIZATION] in gentrification, aka re-urbanization, aka displacement,  has been a serious concern of mine, such a concern that I completed a study on gentrification and the impact that displacement has on native northeast [ORGANIZATION] residents as a college senior thesis DATE2. In my experience growing up as a native northeast [ORGANIZATION] resident, I can recall having great neighbors and streets to play in as a child prior to the major boom of trendy bars, boutiques, restaurants, and other businesses that cater to the middle class hipster and the cultural needs of...  those other than those other than the people of color.",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"After vacating my beloved home experience, I was unable to find available affordable housing within inner [ORGANIZATION] after finding work again. I had no choice but to move back to the same area within [ORGANIZATION] that I ran so quickly from. The loss of our beloved [ORGANIZATION] home was due to underemployment and unavailable affordable housing within inner northeast [PERSON].",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"I saw firsthand when I tried to apply for a [STREET] to stay, I've applied for 30 places in [ORGANIZATION]. Most of the barriers that I've run into are some of the same barriers that other African Americans are running into trying to find affordable housing. I ran into the barrier of where most of the people were asking for three times the income just to qualify for a $900 apartment.",portland
01_07_2016,houseless,"You've got good policies in the plan, but we don't see design as a frill. Obviously, it creates beauty when it's done well, but thoughtful design also recognizes and creates opportunities for greater sustainability, better functionality, and the best use of limited resources.  whether it be for tiny houses, temporary shelter for our houseless neighbors, seamless compatible infill in our residential neighborhoods, or adaptive reuse and new growth along our commercial corridors. Design makes the difference in all those places.",portland

01_07_2016,housing crisis,"I am testifying [TIME] so that you can hear how these restrictions have placed an unnecessary, unfair, and even discriminatory burden on small business owners. Clearly, these outdated...  code restrictions were meant to protect homeowners' property value. The defense that ADUs are somehow meant to address [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis, both in terms of availability and affordability, belies the city's decision to allow ADUs to be rented as [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_09_2019,houseless,"DATE0, I've learned a lot in [LOCATION] because I'm now more involved with helping friends in [ORGANIZATION]. What I learned...  ever since a couple city councils ago, was that the new response is that a notice will be posted in a certain amount of time before any houseless camp is swept away. Before DATE2, there was supposed to be a sweep [DATE] before DATE2 in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_09_2019,homeless,"Thank you. Thank you. Okay, what I want to say is the hallmarks of this project where you go in and you consult with the property owners, they are afforded –  that homeless people are not, and that is the right to be seen as a person before the law.",portland
01_09_2019,homeless,"And when you're confronted with an engineering problem and transportation is very important and how it's all done is very important and how it affects people is very important, when you're talking about  social services and lack of housing and things that impact the homeless, you don't consult the homeless to find out what's going on with them and where the rubber is not meeting the [STREET] or how they're affected. And [ORGANIZATION]  If you do not know where I was [ORGANIZATION] and what I was doing, you won't know what I was talking about, but I went up to your office on [LOCATION] and I left a detailed record.",portland
01_09_2019,homeless,"And I'm talking about...  homeless people who are affected by the services that don't exist or do  exist on paper but don't exist in reality and just the dysfunction of that. And here you were able to work with the property owners. If you worked more with homeless people in terms of directly in conversation with them about what works and what doesn't and what's on paper that  pretends to be there and is not there, you would have a more functional system.",portland
01_09_2019,homeless,"Like, you got this system to work because you consulted the property owners. If you don't talk directly with homeless people, you're never going to fix the homeless problem. So [ORGANIZATION] might be surprised to hear, and thank you for your testimony, you might be surprised to hear I agree with you",portland
01_09_2019,homelessness,"And I do, in fact, spend a considerable amount of time meeting with, talking with, sharing, going to, and being present to understand the situation of people who are directly impacted by homelessness. So I appreciate that. I can, you know, if you read what I wrote to you, my written communication, you will see that services are called, you know, at the exact time and under the exact condition that are prescribed, and they do absolutely nothing.",portland
01_09_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you. And then...  In a desire to also try to talk in plain English, the advantage that we would have is that we could possibly build more affordable housing or use the other resources that we have. We'll have more resources that we could then invest, right?",portland
01_09_2019,affordable housing,"As a result of that, and as a result of some advocacy by people like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and others,  We actually got a more robust investment in affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], which was one of the dividends. But we also made a commitment to continue to partner with [ORGANIZATION] on shared use facilities. And an issue that I believe predated all of us on council was the urban center.  which was put together by very creative people in terms of financing and had money from all kinds of different pots.",portland
01_09_2019,homeless,"I'm not the biggest enthusiasm of everybody that lives in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, but any low-income people that live in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, if they're going to get anything out of this, they should have access to an expanded community garden on these grounds that we're displacing homeless people from,  During, well, the talk is happening now, during [ORGANIZATION] when we're going to have the [STREET] and time count, and find out that what we have failed to do is keep this homeless village situated where it should have remained and increase the number of homeless villages throughout the city so we have less tarps being blown around in windstorms like we experienced [LOCATION], etc., As to whether there might be offered bicycle use there or something like that and costs, I think that given the location of the facility, if we're going to have any talk about any other use other than an expanded community garden for people in the overlooked neighborhood area and anybody that wants to commute to that area along the bike path,  you know, any funding for fancy bike uses or whatever, which should be a conversation that really comes after either [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] have talked to us about how much money they're willing to name this path [PERSON]. If they don't want to spend money to name it [PERSON], then it's just going to be a multi-use path that helps people get to community gardens.",portland

01_17_2018,homeless,"Okay? And like I said, it's not just a homeless problem. Hepatitis C is going, or [ORGANIZATION] is going crazy in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_17_2018,homeless,"They're fining people for feeding homeless people because they think that that's the problem. It starts there, but it spreads to the whole community.

01_17_2018,homeless,"You know, our city would be healthier and happier if we were able to provide this care for everyone in the community, not just, you know, homeless.

But I want to have a clear understanding that I want to start thinking more on where are we going to invest that money. And what I want to have an understanding is that I want to see divestment in fossil fuel extraction companies and investment in the affordable housing and homelessness companies.,portland
01_07_2016,homelessness,"And I want to get thinking on that to start figuring out how we can do that with certain investment vehicles that will enable us to do that in the future. And why I say that, I want a smooth transitioning over from fossil fuel industry, but I also want to create jobs, create housing, and also decrease homelessness. And I want a little bit more thought put into that if I could possibly have that.",portland
01_07_2016,homelessness,"So hello again and with me is [ORGANIZATION] our state government relations manager and [ORGANIZATION] our senior associate and Turning to the state legislative agenda again The draft is very similar to what was brought to you for the at the [ORGANIZATION] work session on  Again, the top priority in the state agenda is housing and homelessness. The four items in this priority, beginning with lifting the preemption on inclusionary zoning, request that the state give [ORGANIZATION] more authority to address needs locally and that they not further intrude on local decision-making.",portland
01_07_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], I have a question on page one under affordable housing and homelessness. Under the lifting the preemption on inclusionary zoning, my sense is that we need to give you as broad a charge as possible since there's a lot of moving pieces here. Okay.",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"So in terms of the policies, there are a few that I think I would like to at least bring your attention to. 2C, use community benefits agreement as an anti-displacement tool that would help engage the community early to create developer agreements that benefit community members. 3C, create permanently affordable housing in market rate developments.",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Man, DATE0 we look at these high rises go up. Is it possible that we could say that maybe 20 or 30 percent of those developments could be affordable housing to give some of our people that have been pushed out an opportunity to either come back and other folks who live in this area the opportunity to stay?",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"We ask that you do this for [ORGANIZATION] because this is the community that belongs to us all and the kind of [STREET] that we say we want to live requires that we do certain things to reach our goals together. To do so, all of these policies or tools must be supported and in [STREET]. This means allowing funding streams to tie affordable housing to job training and placement through community benefit agreements, CBAs.",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"Density, apartment buildings without required parking and skinny houses by themselves don't solve affordable housing needs. Just ask my staff who work blocks from here but live in the numbers. Chapter three of the comp plan calls for coordinated housing, economic development and public facility plans and investments to create an integrated community development approach to restore communities impacted by past decisions.",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,I want you to vote to restore and strengthen communities harmed by gentrification and displacement. I want you to vote to expand access to affordable housing city wide. I want you to vote to make [ORGANIZATION] great.,portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"In this spirit, we must remind the city that increasing density without also proactively preventing displacement and better supporting tenants in this city would simply reproduce the injustices of the past. As such,  As such, we continue to support policies that incentivize the construction of affordable housing units and much stronger renter protections as a whole. A city that depends on growing through displacing working persons of color and families and its most vulnerable residents cannot in any sense of the word call itself sustainable.",portland
01_07_2016,homeless,"I'm a [ORGANIZATION] native [ORGANIZATION] resident who lived [PERSON] of my life in stable, secure homes. I'm a single mother, single African-American mother of one child and graduate of [ORGANIZATION]. My experience also includes assisting homeless families with obtaining and maintaining housing.",portland
01_07_2016,homeless,"I have worked the front lines holding several positions serving the homeless population, at-risk youth, those with addictions, along with the mentally and physically disabled for [ORGANIZATION]. I have worked in social services for [ORGANIZATION] in gentrification, aka re-urbanization, aka displacement,  has been a serious concern of mine, such a concern that I completed a study on gentrification and the impact that displacement has on native northeast [ORGANIZATION] residents as a college senior thesis DATE2. In my experience growing up as a native northeast [ORGANIZATION] resident, I can recall having great neighbors and streets to play in as a child prior to the major boom of trendy bars, boutiques, restaurants, and other businesses that cater to the middle class hipster and the cultural needs of...  those other than those other than the people of color.",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"After vacating my beloved home experience, I was unable to find available affordable housing within inner [ORGANIZATION] after finding work again. I had no choice but to move back to the same area within [ORGANIZATION] that I ran so quickly from. The loss of our beloved [ORGANIZATION] home was due to underemployment and unavailable affordable housing within inner northeast [PERSON].",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"I saw firsthand when I tried to apply for a [STREET] to stay, I've applied for 30 places in [ORGANIZATION]. Most of the barriers that I've run into are some of the same barriers that other African Americans are running into trying to find affordable housing. I ran into the barrier of where most of the people were asking for three times the income just to qualify for a $900 apartment.",portland
01_07_2016,houseless,"You've got good policies in the plan, but we don't see design as a frill. Obviously, it creates beauty when it's done well, but thoughtful design also recognizes and creates opportunities for greater sustainability, better functionality, and the best use of limited resources.  whether it be for tiny houses, temporary shelter for our houseless neighbors, seamless compatible infill in our residential neighborhoods, or adaptive reuse and new growth along our commercial corridors. Design makes the difference in all those places.",portland
01_07_2016,affordable housing,"I'm a third-generation property owner, and my daughters live in the area, and so they will follow in my footsteps. I've been in communication with [ORGANIZATION] and with [ORGANIZATION]. And I'm aware of the affordable housing issues, commercial space issues, common area plaza, and curb appeal, and parking issues.",portland
01_07_2016,housing crisis,"I am testifying [TIME] so that you can hear how these restrictions have placed an unnecessary, unfair, and even discriminatory burden on small business owners. Clearly, these outdated...  code restrictions were meant to protect homeowners' property value. The defense that ADUs are somehow meant to address [ORGANIZATION]'s housing crisis, both in terms of availability and affordability, belies the city's decision to allow ADUs to be rented as [ORGANIZATION].",portland
01_23_2019,houseless,"If you are saying that interrupting your gathering for [TIME] to fight for some issue is bad, we very much disagree. I spend most of my time trying to stop these sweeps that murder houseless people on the streets. They take the very stuff that the [STREET] angels just gave them [ORGANIZATION] before.",portland
01_23_2019,homeless,"People really like it. That use isn't even allowed anymore with the new zone, which is unfortunate. In that area, there's a lot of homeless people.",portland
01_23_2019,homeless,"And homeless people and parents with kids aren't a good mix. I've been here before asking that city council allow the [INSTITUTION] to enforce laws and request the homeless people to pick up their tents and move, and that's what the law says they can do. When I ask the police to do that, they tell me that city council, specifically the mayor, has told them that they're not allowed to do that, they're not allowed to enforce the law.",portland
01_23_2019,homelessness,"It is not the failure of the people who find that they cannot afford to live in a city where they work, worship, and go to school. Homelessness is not a crime. I understand that.",portland
01_23_2019,houseless,"But I'm cleaning up poop and needles on my property [DATE]. I think what we need to do is find good ways for houseless people to be able to have sanitary access like the rest of us do. But again, I just don't think policing is the appropriate response to people who are houseless.",portland
01_23_2019,homeless,"PERSON0 of [ORGANIZATION]. I think we all know what happened in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Okay.",portland
01_23_2019,homeless,"I don't understand that. Like, I don't understand that [ORGANIZATION] made in his effort to become mayor saying he was going to house the homeless, and he still hasn't got it done. I need to remind you to stick to the relevant testimony.",portland
01_23_2019,homeless; unhoused,"I understand, but you're going off track. These people  people would be deported without their legal representation. And I'm saying the homeless are unhoused because they do not have legal representation.",portland
02_22_2017,affordable housing,"And in green is the average [ORGANIZATION] ridership on the [ORGANIZATION] streetcar. So very, very – oops, hang on a second – very, very direct connection to housing,  affordable housing and investment on the streetcar system with our ridership. And again, what we know from the ridership surveys that we've done is the people who are using the system are the people who live right on the system.",portland
02_22_2017,affordable housing,"They want to move the people around to different locations, so it makes a lot of sense. I do want to see more affordable housings in the plan, not just a quarter, but up to 50% of affordable housing on the streetcar lanes. There's no reason why that can't be requested and implemented and create more workforce housing where corporations can come in and pay for that cost for that type of housing.",portland
02_22_2017,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], I guess it was. What council intended was to waive the parking requirements for projects that provided on-site or off-site affordable housing, but not to waive the parking requirements for projects that paid a fee in lieu. I believe Commissioner [PERSON], this was your amendment at that time, the code amendment.",portland
02_22_2017,homeless,"I didn't know what his animus towards me was, so I said, I didn't. Maybe I'm close to the [INSTITUTION], so I said, I'm not homeless. I don't know why I said that.",portland
02_22_2017,homeless,"I believe there was, related to another allegation, but I didn't refresh on that for this meeting. And I would suspect that if it did come up that...  There was significant evidence that the appellant was putting his hands into his pockets and throwing things on the ground. I think the appellant said that he wanted to show his driver's license to prove who he was and that he wasn't homeless.",portland
02_22_2017,homeless,"The situation escalated quickly, clearly. The complainant appeared to be afraid and perhaps panicked, based on emptying his pockets, asking what he had done, saying he wasn't homeless. I can imagine why he said that.",portland
06_09_2016,homelessness,"The total general fund [ORGANIZATION] is $602 million, of which $501 million of that is discretionary. And the total [ORGANIZATION] in this adopted budget will be $3,065. You're all familiar with this as we've gone through the entire process, but the additional investments, I think it's worth just reminding folks that there is an additional over $30 million in money being invested in housing and homelessness, $11.5 million in city infrastructure, close to $7 million in public safety, and $4.5 million of parks, among some other key investments in this overall budget.",portland
06_09_2016,homeless,"Fiscal oversight of this program will be provided by [ORGANIZATION], not [ORGANIZATION]. And then the last amendment is a motion to increase funding in ORG2 for homeless services, and this would increase intergovernmental revenues in ORG2, the home grant fund, by $321,634 to support homeless services. The federal grant funds have been awarded to the city and must be appropriated in the budget to be available for expenditure on [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_09_2016,homeless,"PERSON0? This is a budget that, among other things, makes historic investments in housing and homeless services and also...  begins to address the staffing issues in [ORGANIZATION] by authorizing money for more staff for a bureau that is really overworked under staff. So I really appreciate the fact that we're able to do that.",portland
06_09_2016,homelessness,"DATE0, it was transportation, and the mayor and Commissioner [PERSON] led the council in making substantial new investments in basic infrastructure. DATE1, it's housing and homelessness. And I'm proud, as my colleagues have all said, to be on a council which has said we're going to prioritize discretionary money to address this crisis on our streets.",portland
06_09_2016,homelessness,"And without further ado, I'll turn it over to the stellar panel we have here, [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], the director, and [ORGANIZATION], our equity and policy director. I think, PERSON3, you're going to walk us through? PERSON3's the primary presenter, but just as a framing of this, you mentioned the historic investments in housing and homelessness, and these resources are an essential part of our successful strategy moving forward.",portland
06_09_2016,homelessness,"Thank you. And this plan couldn't have happened without our continued cooperation and with our partnering jurisdictions and the staff work of our equity policy director, [ORGANIZATION], who did our data analysis for the needs assessment, and [ORGANIZATION] team that worked on the homelessness sections here that are so important to [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you.",portland
06_09_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"And what's important to know is that this plan, when we met with the community and our stakeholders...  asks that we create, we identify what are the basic needs. And the basic needs from the community were that we needed affordable housing choice, that we need basic services and homeless prevention and intervention, and community economic development. And the goals that we recommended fall right in line with those needs, that we need to increase affordable housing choices, that we need to reduce homelessness, increase stability for all residents, and improve our infrastructure and facilities and economic opportunities.",portland
06_09_2016,homelessness,"So what you will see in this [ORGANIZATION] plan is that we're looking at approximately $88 million over a [ORGANIZATION] period with these entitlement funds. The majority is going to new homeownership development, some of it to rehab and preservation, followed by homelessness prevention and economic development. And they will all follow into those three goals and needs that I outlined.",portland
06_09_2016,affordable housing,"And then in terms of our CDBG funding, the majority of that is going towards housing redevelopment. Our home funding is going towards also to new affordable housing. And in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], they're using some of that money for tenant-based rental assistance.",portland
06_09_2016,affordable housing,"And in our action plan, I'm just showing you what you've already decided through the budget, how they will be presented to [ORGANIZATION] in terms of these three main needs and goals. So first was to increase and preserve affordable housing choice. And the programs under preserving affordable housing choice include housing redevelopment, support of our community-based development organizations, and new affordable housing.",portland
06_09_2016,affordable housing,"So on that slide, so you've got $2.8 million for new affordable housing. Can you give me a sense of how is that money allocated? Sure.",portland
06_09_2016,affordable housing,"There are three goals, and it's the first that I'm presenting. Okay. But also in terms of investment of our entitlement dollars for this projected for [ORGANIZATION] period in [LOCATION], there's a larger investment in new affordable housing than in the other objectives.",portland
06_09_2016,affordable housing,"New affordable housing could be multifamily rental, but we're talking about homeownership here or both? We're talking about both. Is there a change in the investment in affordable homeownership?",portland
06_09_2016,homelessness,"A second goal for our federal resources is reducing homelessness and increasing stability. And if we break out the resources, the federal resources that are going towards that particular objective,  We can see that we're using [ORGANIZATION] for emergency shelter and rapid rehousing. We're also investing in ORG1.",portland
06_09_2016,homeless,"How much general fund does [ORGANIZATION] get? Well, at the present time, nearly all the general fund money is proposed to be transmitted through [ORGANIZATION] to the joint office because it's nearly all homeless support services. and I can give you a detailed breakdown.",portland
07_05_2017,affordable housing,"There's a story of food as a solution that has created safe neighborhoods, economic independence and healthy connected communities. So [ORGANIZATION] is based in [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing neighborhoods and they are layers and layers to what we do. We grow food, cook food, sell food and share food as a means to build community resilience.",portland
07_05_2017,affordable housing,"It's the only nonprofit grocery store in the city that actually authentically puts healthy food on a level playing field. [PERSON] came out of a [ORGANIZATION] community process in [ORGANIZATION], which is [PERSON]'s largest affordable housing neighborhood. Community leaders identified that the neighborhood needed a grocery store that was easy to get to, that was affordable, that carried culturally relevant and healthy options, that provided a [STREET] of employment for neighbors, and did not sell alcohol, tobacco, and lottery tickets.",portland
07_05_2017,affordable housing,"But to put the human face on it,  When we talk about very poor people that cannot access affordable housing in our community, we're talking about people who make 30 percent or less of the area median income. And for a single person, that's $15,000 a year. And for a family of three, that's $20,000.",portland
07_05_2017,affordable housing,"We'll go through the usual surplus property procedure that Commissioner [PERSON] pioneered. I suspect that...  there won't be any city bureaus or others that will be wanting to use it. It's in a low density area with very poor transit service, so in terms of affordable housing, it doesn't have all that much capacity.",portland
07_05_2017,homeless,"They learned this in the Second World War. But I really would say that... There's nothing wrong with people like are homeless, living off the grid in a sleeping bag, having a small solar panel, power up their phone, their computer.",portland
08_17_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], are you here? All right, let's move on and see if he comes later. 945, please.  Request of PERSON1 to address council regarding the new move the city made with the homeless to close one shelter.",portland
08_17_2016,affordable housing,"Yes, one of the issues that I have is that  I like the direction of how [ORGANIZATION] is taking more responsibility toward the affordable housing issue, also by the affordable housing bond that is being proposed, the new riverfront shelter by Mr. [PERSON] that has gone into the lease mode at this time. And I always hesitate what the last director for [ORGANIZATION] did before,  on trying to acquire the post office by paying an outrageous price for that property in [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION] and i questioned their judgment on that where in my opinion if commissioner [PERSON] was handling that transaction that outrageous price wouldn't have been at that number and we're starting to see a lot of other properties being purchased there was one over there that  Mr. [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON] had an interest, came in with an offer.",portland
08_17_2016,affordable housing,"And again, I want to see the direction that [ORGANIZATION] is going on the affordable housing bond.  and understand that we have to have leadership in those areas to make sure things are done properly. And I believe that Commissioner [PERSON] is able to do that. And I've lost all confidence in ORG1 on what they did on FAC0.",portland
08_17_2016,homeless,"I think many of you may recall I'm not the biggest fan of everything that happens at [ORGANIZATION], but I know they do have a new executive director just coming on board, and I hope that –  her work will be able to give us solid numbers talking about jobs retained, jobs grown, people moving up from poverty, the real ideas behind urban renewal areas. And I know, even though we're highly critical of you at [ORGANIZATION], I know that that's also your concern is that, you know,  government should work to ensure justice, and justice includes maximizing economic opportunity for people at the bottom. People at the top can do so well that they can sometimes fund a 400-bed [INSTITUTION].",portland
08_17_2016,homeless,"And I hope this will go off without any nitwit lawsuits trying to –  forces in some neoliberalism idiocy where we're going to sue the [ORGANIZATION] so that the environmental services can extort the maximum possible amount of money towards the  towards rate payers when we try and help the homeless. I think that that's going to be another dismissed lawsuit like the poor judgment of ORG1 when they tried to sue the city saying, the mayor's not doing enough to help us suppress homeless people. So I'm glad this came off consent",portland

09_19_2018,homeless,"You're good to go. So the main reason why I wanted to come here, actually, what made me come here is, so I live downtown [ORGANIZATION]. And I'm sure everyone here can agree that just going grocery shopping or going into [ORGANIZATION] businesses, they're surrounded by homeless people.",portland
09_19_2018,homeless,"And these homeless people will be, I mean, waving around weapons or things made into weapons or just  being kind of a nuisance right outside of the door.

09_19_2018,homelessness,"We worked in collaboration with [ORGANIZATION] from the beginning  [PERSON] helped us provide training for ORG2 and that has had some impact according to their testimony in the work that they do to end homelessness.

09_19_2018,housing crisis,"and that is that the report clearly identifies that a lack of tenant protections, especially around screening criteria, continues to be an obstacle for renters of all walks of life. The private housing market is too often failing us by rejecting applicants for minor issues on their records. A lack of regulations has allowed private profit to become more important than the public good, and the result is the housing crisis that we're in.",portland
09_19_2018,homelessness,"And for about $60 a day, we can actually...  [STREET] someone in a deeply affordable home with the services they need to get their life back on track.

09_07_2016,homeless,"I understand that that's going to be [ORGANIZATION]. And I hope that as time goes by, we can have some more conversations about how are we going to spend taxpayers' money wisely, how we're going to protect ratepayers from any suggestion of not paying for homeless services, because that's not allowed. And I know that all our council are very dedicated to doing that.",portland
09_07_2016,homelessness,I appreciate people treating this emergency like an emergency. Because it is. And it's an emergency in both housing affordability and in homelessness.,portland

09_07_2016,homeless,"If we open up [ORGANIZATION] and only put 100 people in there and have an additional 400 beds, that's very beneficial to you in the event we do have a natural disaster that we need to relocate people.

09_07_2016,homeless,"It's not just for the homeless, really. It's also for people that might be displaced out of their homes due to a disaster. And these developers stepping up right now, it's very important to understand that, of the capacity of these mass shelters and the importance not just for the homeless  but for all the city itself.",portland
09_07_2016,homeless,"And this is a new direction we're seeing now, and I think it's the most important direction to look at in working from your position and working from housing to make sure these projects do go forward and understand it's just not about the homeless. It's about having that additional space in the event we have a true emergency out there to truly locate them into these facilities. And I think that's a very important issue at this time.",portland

The proposed $7 million reduction to the original budget still increases the ORG1 budget over [ORGANIZATION] and thus increases the policing of black Portlanders and other marginalized members of our community.

We're here to take the next steps towards the final vote on the expanding opportunities for affordable housing project. The project, as you recall, includes two items, some zoning code changes to allow conditional use institutions in residential zones to  add housing to their sites without having to revise their conditional use permit, as well as zoning map and comprehensive plan map amendments on a number of other sites, institutional sites where it would facilitate more specific opportunities.",portland
06_10_2020,affordable housing,"On [ORGANIZATION], you held a public hearing and took testimony on this item. Some of the testimony suggested additional sites be considered for zoning changes, and there was also testimony expressing concern about several of the sites.

06_24_2015,affordable housing,"As I mentioned, the vision for [ORGANIZATION], if you go beyond the actual dollars that we're putting to work and what the city's outcomes are, you can see here the broader outcomes. When [ORGANIZATION] was created, when FAC0 was created, we talked about things like 10,000 jobs, housing units. Obviously, affordable housing units is part of that.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"So it's tied to the assessed value of the projects that [ORGANIZATION] would bring online. In addition, there's an affordable housing option in [ORGANIZATION], and that option is highlighted in the purple square or rectangle, and we'll go into more detail on that in a moment. We also start a park partnership with the ORG1 in regards to where a park might be, size, location, and programming-wise.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"We need that $210 million of assessed value to get the $35 million or the $24 million of [ORGANIZATION] that then allows us to do our investments.

In regards to FAC0 and the affordable housing approach, the [ORGANIZATION] housing goals for FAC0 included 479 units serving 0 to 60 percent MFI.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"This RFP included a program requirement for a minimum of 200 affordable housing units serving 0 to 60% MFI, and of those units for 90 to serve 0 to 30% MFI. We have three proposals that were received for that RFP, and the selection committee and evaluation committee is currently reviewing those proposals. We also are including an affordable housing option in the development agreement with the [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"That option will also include an escalation rate that's based on the CPI up until the time that option is executed. And we're projecting that that option would be executed in [ORGANIZATION].

06_24_2015,affordable housing,"primarily with [ORGANIZATION], but also with [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, [PERSON], and other bureaus that may have a part in FAC0.

06_24_2015,affordable housing,I'd like to congratulate the parties for arriving in an agreement that provides for the continued development of FAC0 and with the [ORGANIZATION]'s and [ORGANIZATION]'s obligation to provide funding for the extension of FAC1  ultimately to provide one-[STREET] northbound traffic flow. The agreement appears to provide protections for each party involved. ORG2 is providing an option for ORG3 to purchase a lot during [ORGANIZATION] of development for affordable housing.,portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"And as we've already heard, this is in addition to FAC0, which is now fully occupied, and to what is expected to be another affordable housing project at FAC1 on FAC2. So FAC3 really will be moving forward on its earlier commitments to affordable housing, which I think is very positive. I applaud the potential district energy system which [ORGANIZATION] may develop and to which ORG1 buildings may ultimately connect for its environmental impact possibilities.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"What I've witnessed and watched happen is that this diversity in the neighborhood, whether you're a luxury condo homeowner or you're an employee at [ORGANIZATION], I mean, this helps [STREET] the retail in the neighborhood. So as [ORGANIZATION] continues to move forward, I'm a big fan of continuing this diversity in the neighborhood, whether it's affordable housing, whether it's [ORGANIZATION] employment, whether it's more market rate housing, which I'm always a fan of. But I think that diversity really leads to a complete neighborhood, and I think really –  The conversation in [LOCATION] is just another great neighborhood in the city of [ORGANIZATION], and I think the retailers play a big piece of that, and I think the clientele of the retailers help [STREET] that forward.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"The vision at the outset was a community that includes an equitable share of affordable housing, affordable to households with lower incomes, particularly, as was pointed out, at certain income levels like 60% of median and below and 30% of median and below. Land in the [ORGANIZATION] area is appreciating continually, given the ongoing investments in the area. And so the city's acquisition of land for the purpose of affordable housing is the right strategy.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"And so it's very notable that the family is agreeing to sell property to the city expressly for the purpose of affordable housing. It demonstrates their long-held commitment to promoting inclusion in the neighborhood. And it could serve as a model across the city, too, of how to do things differently.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"the purchase price for example remains to be determined but as we saw there's a clear process outlined in the agreement of how that will be done so i think that also is a good thing last thing i would say is approval [ORGANIZATION] does not complete the work not only on the development side but on the affordable housing goals it is true that combined with parcel 3 and this new opportunity  from the [ORGANIZATION] family, we can likely meet the goals that were set out and shown on the slides earlier. It's important to remember that those goals, when they were set, were associated with a number of 3,000 total housing units in the neighborhood, that that was sort of the vision and that that goal was attached to kind of that first phase of 3,000 housing units. We're just about at that point, I believe, we're about to cross that milestone.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"So there still is a conversation that needs to happen to clarify what goals would we have in the future as the neighborhood grows further. So there is work to be done still on affordable housing even beyond this, but it's true that with this additional opportunity, we have come a long [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION]. So thank you very much.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"We believe [ORGANIZATION] should focus on catalyzing private sector job growth, and this agreement is in effort to do that. We applaud the earlier extension and expansion of [ORGANIZATION], as it has largely made possible the city's investment and affordable housing components of this agreement. This public-private partnership between the city, [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2 is mutually beneficial and reaffirms the party's longstanding commitment to economic development in [LOCATION].",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"The agreement will accelerate development and result in more jobs and public benefits, ranging from transportation to open space to affordable housing. This prime waterfront property is the largest available site left in the central city and is ripe for development, located near new transit lines and  and one of the region's largest employers, [ORGANIZATION]. Seizing these opportunities are key to promoting the innovation quadrant, where major projects have already led to transformative investments by local universities, developers, and employers.",portland

We actually had an affordable housing memorial he participated in here, I'm going to guess, about [ORGANIZATION].

06_24_2015,affordable housing,"Ah.  did not build the promised affordable housing. Now that the property values have escalated because of all the city's funding and the development and putting in the roads and the streetcar, now we're thinking about how much we're going to spend in future prices to put in a park? No.",portland
06_24_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"I think [PERSON] has plenty of money to build that park. And I think that $5 million will go a long ways to addressing the housing crisis that we have. Let me repeat myself, because we never built the promised affordable housing when we developed that whole area and changed it from the toxic waste site that it was  We have remediated that as a society.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"Well, they develop that aren't ideal. And so I support the recommendations that they'll they'll bring forward and won't address them here. But I did want to say thank you for stopping the process and asking [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to kind of go back to the table and look at how they could address affordable housing and the development agreement.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"I know doing that at [ORGANIZATION] doesn't put [ORGANIZATION] in the greatest position of leverage, and I think that what they have proposed is a long ways from where we were just [LOCATION]. So it is exciting to see this is a historic development agreement, both as it relates to the residential development, but just the development and economic development that will come from development of that property. One of the things I did want to address is, as a number of folks have said already, this agreement itself isn't the only thing that needs to happen in the district as it relates to affordable housing.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,So these were the discussions that we were having before we even approved the urban renewal district. And I do think right now we have one affordable housing project. I would argue that everything else is a high-end enclave.,portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"We do have – [ORGANIZATION] does own significant land in the district, and I'd ask that the city –  work with [ORGANIZATION] to find how we can commit some of that land for residential development, affordable housing, and workforce housing. [ORGANIZATION] still owes ORG1 $2 million. The value of that probably is about $2.4, $2.5 million looking at inflation, not taking into account opportunity costs.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"And we know from a survey in [ORGANIZATION] that 88 percent at that time, 88 percent of the employees at [ORGANIZATION] made less than $50,000. One-third of the employees at [ORGANIZATION] made less than $20,000. So I really want to see that we're having a conversation about how both affordable housing and housing at 80% median income really does support [ORGANIZATION] and the work they're doing and our economic investment in the district.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,The DA places deadlines on the city's acquisition and development of the park and the affordable housing parcels. [ORGANIZATION] will be needed to finance those projects. The availability of [ORGANIZATION] depends entirely on when [ORGANIZATION] develops its properties.,portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"The [ORGANIZATION] money kicks us to 60, and I'm on your side, and I want more housing, and I want to make sure we hit our targets. I just want to be clear, the assumptions around money for affordable housing, you get to the 47, which is the amount we have for the first two projects,  is exclusive of the ORG1 agreement. Okay.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,It's not advisable to tie the city's right to buy and develop these sites to a time frame over which the city has no control. The housing and the park are too important to the district to risk losing them due to the unpredictable timing of real estate development. The [ORGANIZATION] recognizes the efforts [PERSON] made to strengthen the affordable housing provisions.,portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"Keep in mind that in [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] paid $5 million for FAC0. This DA commits only $5 million in [ORGANIZATION] for acquisition. Instead, a timeline and pricing formula similar to that for the affordable housing site should be applied.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"If development does not occur, [ORGANIZATION] fails to materialize, and the city does not meet the deadlines for acquiring the affordable housing and park properties, what are the consequences? We read the DA to say that the city will lose the right to acquire these properties if it does not purchase them by the deadlines set forth in the agreement. In the event of environmental contamination or tidal complications, the agreement caps [ORGANIZATION]'s responsibility for curative measures at $250,000.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"There are significant exposures and risks that need to be addressed before this agreement is executed, and we encourage you to attend to them. And also, in the time I have left, I want to second [ORGANIZATION] comments about [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] has been saying that over and over again, that [ORGANIZATION] needs to step up and provide a site for an affordable housing project.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"So could staff come back up, please, [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], for any other questions from council? [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] raises a question, I think a very important question about under what circumstances could we effectively lose the option to purchase the dirt in the ORG1 development for affordable housing. Now, we've got timelines here, and we know from your presentation we've got resources, [ORGANIZATION] resources that are developed exclusive  independent from the ORG2 development agreement, but under what circumstance could the city lose its option to purchase that shirt?",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"So the option that will be negotiated includes a timeline for the acquisition. We outlined projected dates for when that would occur. And those dates are outlined in the development agreement as well, specifically requiring that the purchase option for the affordable housing needs to be executed by [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,correct and um how much uh tiff do you anticipate will be available for the just for the acquisition of this uh land um independent of whether mr [ORGANIZATION] moves forward with his development as of [ORGANIZATION] independent of the development agreement i mean without without without any new tiff being generated as a as a result of his development What's the what you're going to spend 19 million in block three? What are the available resources for affordable housing as of [ORGANIZATION]?,portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"And as is her style, she got directly involved in the sort of personal diplomacy to satisfy her concerns. Okay. DATE0, we were looking at a district before the mayor's proposal to do reset on urban renewal generally that was projected to have about $7 million for affordable housing.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,And I  you know and without the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]'s commitment to expand to south waterfront uh you know another piece of the puzzle uh would not have happened so met the major piece ORG2 [ORGANIZATION]'s major commitment there and really this is the last major piece and i'm really excited about both the opportunity to allow us to achieve our affordable housing goals  in the [LOCATION] waterfront and I think this does protect the public's interest by Providing is setting a price for the purchase of the parcel of land in advance and I believe that we will based on the wildly successful Development that we anticipate will happen there that we will have adequate resources when those resources are needed to add these additional units of affordable housing and more,portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor. Mr. [PERSON], I appreciate you bringing that. The other concern that was pending after the hearing was about the level of affordable housing requirements.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] did indicate on the record during the testimony that she is committed to providing some compensation towards affordable housing. I want to state on the record that this does not... This is under the current rules, and this doesn't set a precedent for any future developments that we would actually require to provide a definite level of affordable housing subsidy if that's the [STREET] the council chooses to go.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"I just want to say that  I appreciate Commissioner [PERSON]'s points, as well as Commissioner [PERSON]'s, and to the extent [ORGANIZATION] will be engaged in this second PDA on this,  design issues and the use of the affordable housing bonus, we will continue to actively participate. And I'm very pleased that [ORGANIZATION] has chosen to use this affordable housing bonus to obtain the additional height. And she committed to me that this would be at least a $500,000 payment into our housing investment fund.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"So it's a great move, and I look forward. And I really appreciate [ORGANIZATION] stepping up and utilizing the affordable housing bonus to obtain the additional height they need for this building. Bye.",portland
06_24_2015,affordable housing,"PERSON0? Aye. PERSON1?

06_24_2015,homeless,"I don't know whether this is part of the discussion. A couple of times I've been on the FAC0 going to the convention center and have seen our officers working with their inspectors in a fairly aggressive manner.  particularly against people who appear to be homeless and that was not my understanding of what transit police were doing i wasn't aware that you were part of the fair enforcement team parents enforcement is very uh important uh to the transit uh to trimet and we do partner up they handle the fair inspecting and we handle uh looking at criminal histories and um  exclusions and warrants and we do those for a number of reasons.

07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Update the floor area ratio bonus and transfer provisions of [ORGANIZATION] for the central city to prioritize affordable housing development and other targeted public benefits. Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mr. [PERSON] and members of the council.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"DATE0, the city council had its first hearing on revising the floor area bonus and transfer system to prioritize affordable housing. The council charged [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to conduct an economic analysis and to develop recommendations for an incentive zoning bonus for affordable housing in the central city. This proposal doesn't reprioritize how we use taxpayer funds.",portland
07_09_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"In fact, it doesn't use any taxpayer funds at all. It expands the pie of dollars available for affordable housing development and  by bringing to the table the development community to help be part of the solution to the affordable housing crisis. Floor area bonuses, also known as density bonuses, are provided to developers in exchange for the developers providing a community benefit.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"What we cannot require, however, is affordable housing. State law prevents us from doing that. It is past time to streamline our bonus system to prioritize for the creation of affordable housing.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"In fact, there was a [ORGANIZATION] study that pointed out how many of our bonuses are really not in keeping or haven't been used or not keeping with current policy priorities of the city. This proposal before us DATE1 is crafted to grow the supply of affordable housing. It creates an on-site building option for developers to add affordable housing in future developments for Portlanders who may work in the central city, but housing near their work is currently unaffordable to them.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"a household that makes between 60 and 80 percent of the median family income is not a wealthy household it may be a household with two food service workers a single parent working as a bus driver with two kids or an entry-level teacher our state of the housing report which we brought to council [ORGANIZATION] has shown that the central city and many other [ORGANIZATION] neighborhoods are unaffordable to these families it also clearly shows  just how unaffordable our city in general is to many lower income families. So let me be clear. This proposal will also add substantial housing stock for households in the lower incomes from 0% to 60% of median family income by providing an option for developers to pay into an affordable housing fund, which is limited to investing in 0% to 60% of median family income housing.",portland
07_09_2015,homelessness,"So this fund will aid the city in its goal to create more housing for more families who are experiencing homelessness and other households such as senior citizens who are relying entirely on [ORGANIZATION] for their income. And as always, ORG1 continues its deep commitment to equity and how it invests these funds. So before I turn the presentation over to PERSON0 of ORG2, [PERSON], and our economic consultant, PERSON2, I'd like to make a small amendment to the resolution in terms of the timeline.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"And the proposal we came up with has sort of five key elements. On the bonus end, we're proposing a bonus for affordable housing that's either built on site or we want to have an option where a payment into an affordable housing fund is an additional [STREET] to earn the bonus. Secondly, the strata of affordability that we focused and modeled on is 80% of median family income units.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"So we can do that as we develop the specifics of the proposal by calibrating the value of those two bonuses a little differently. Okay. Four is that we want to have fewer bonus options, fewer than the 18 now that we have, so that we can make the affordable housing bonus a greater priority.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"And also, to the extent that we include other bonuses in the final package, we're going to try to calibrate them in terms of their value to the affordable housing bonus so that the bonus –  We're getting the similar valuation or similar amounts of public benefit if you choose one of the other options, but the idea is to try to make the affordable housing bonus the most attractive because of the documented need for affordable housing in general and in the central city. The one exception, there's a couple of exceptions to this just to mention that in [ORGANIZATION],  In some sub-districts, we've got these bonuses that were really designed to be part of the development package because in [ORGANIZATION] we needed to deliver, for instance, waterfront improvements in the FAC0. So there's a bonus in [ORGANIZATION] for additional FAC0 properties, and there's a transfer provisions in [ORGANIZATION] as well.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"So as we do this research, we're going to look at those in particular ones and see if there's logic or reasons that maybe they should be continued. And we're also going to say if they're continued, how do we calibrate them to work in conjunction with an affordable housing bonus. And so, and finally, there are limits in the central city now.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,It had an FAR of four to one and we were able to get to six to one using the existing residential bonus. So that's what the column all the [STREET] to the left represents. And then we looked at two cases adding an affordable housing requirement to getting the additional density.,portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"They must be calibrated to the market, and then they must pencil out. Because if they don't pencil out, we're just going to create a strong incentive for people to jump to some other incentive, other bonus that doesn't provide the same level of public benefit, and we're undercutting what we're trying to do here with the affordable housing bonus. Is that a fair comment?",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Okay, not yet. Following up, looking at the resolution, it says support historic preservation through the [ORGANIZATION] transfer and development of publicly owned private space through transfer provisions. So essentially this resolution is saying that affordable housing will be the only bonus that's available?  Does it say that explicitly?",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"It says based on our study, our recommendation for affordable housing is a bonus and our recommendation for historic preservation and open space is a transfer. And I believe our study didn't reach a conclusion about which or how many of those other bonuses you get rid of. But what it did conclude is two things.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"One is we want to make affordable housing the priority, just given the state that we're in, in terms of housing prices and availability. And the second is we want to calibrate whatever else the city council thinks is valuable enough to put in a central city bonus so that it's in the same ballpark and comparable competitive with the affordable housing bonus. So the [STREET] that it's written, it doesn't actually say that in my opinion.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"When we're done with testimony, I'd like to hear what the outreach has been and who's been involved in the discussions. Just for the record, the assignment to [ORGANIZATION] on this issue was not to come back with a proposal to eliminate the other bonuses. It was to come up with a proposal that would create incentives for the affordable housing.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"I also sit on [ORGANIZATION] of the city and I'm a member of [ORGANIZATION]. I want to thank you for your opportunity to have me come and speak in support of this ordinance [ORGANIZATION]. As you know, ORG2 and our partners are advocating for multiple tools and policies to help meet the affordable housing needs in our city and across the state.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"In light of the city's recent state of housing report and [ORGANIZATION]'s new fair housing requirements that came out [ORGANIZATION],  There's no doubt that this is a significant issue here in the city and that the federal government is going to be watching carefully going forward on what efforts we're making in order to permanently further fair housing and make sure that there's an adequate supply of affordable housing in all of [ORGANIZATION]'s high opportunity areas. Certainly the central city is one of those key high opportunity areas and this is a great first step and the city asserting itself to meet that requirement. We know that there's no single tool or solution that will address the entire shortfall of homes and the ranges of needs in our community.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"We need to pursue multiple tools and strategies at all levels of government and across all sectors. To take just one example, [ORGANIZATION], along with 95 other organizations, are working within ORG1 to create a long-term, very large, sustainable revenue source to help fund affordable housing. We see this ordinance as a great complement to that effort.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"This proposal, while it's not a complete solution, is a critical step forward. Redesigning and updating the central city bonus system to prioritize affordable housing is absolutely the right thing to do, and we applaud Commissioner [PERSON] for bringing this proposal forward. In [ORGANIZATION]'s market, beneficial amenities like bike racks and eco-roofs have become common practice.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,Because it helps us capture the value of density and use that value to address our growing need for affordable housing. I think we all recognize that need. And I think we know that the greatest need citywide is for housing affordable to households at 0 to 60% [ORGANIZATION].,portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,It's great that there's also a proposed payment in lieu option. It gives developers an option to pay into a fund that allows us to increase resources for 0% to 60% housing citywide. We desperately need more affordable housing and targeting the value created by FAR bonuses is a perfect [STREET] to generate these resources.,portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"I'll be brief. I think, as you know, [ORGANIZATION] provides a portfolio of affordable housing, and we also provide...  rent assistance to thousands of families in our community to help them pay their rent. And the ability of the rent assistance that we have available [ORGANIZATION] is not enough to help people afford to live in a lot of areas of the central city.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,PERSON0 Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] urges council to support Commissioner [PERSON]'s resolution prioritizing affordable housing development in the city's FAR bonus and transfer provisions.,portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Instead, benefits incentivized through this FAR bonus and transfer provision must prioritize one of our city's most pressing issues, affordable housing. Without stable affordable housing, our families may not see these benefits of public parks, open spaces or bike racks. The FAR bonus and transfer provisions are just one tool of many required to meet the housing needs of our communities.",portland
07_09_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,No one tool will be the solution to the city's affordable housing crisis. Incentive zoning practices that support affordable housing development or in lieu fund by the private market allow developers to be part of the solution. Our city needs to capture the value of density and elevate affordable housing as a primary community benefit in this mechanism.,portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"We also see, as many have reiterated, that  We have a need for housing regardless, and we need more units. And to prioritize and capture some of those within the 60% to 80% leaves a lot more room for public investment into the 0% to 60%. We see that by incentivizing the private market to develop and include affordable housing  we can use additional funds for zero to 60.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Mm-hmm. So again, I'm going to have to go back that it's still fewer households that we're going to be able to house. It's fewer affordable housing units that will be built.",portland
07_09_2015,homelessness,"60% of them are people of color between 60 and 80% of the median income. This is part of the continuum of housing support that we desperately need to allow people who are stable in their jobs to move into more stable housing to free up some of those critical units and target the public dollar that's so precious to the city and the county to the zero to 60% of median income that you're addressing, Commissioner [PERSON].  which we're all deeply committed to. That's the kind of crisis on the front lines of moving people out of homelessness.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Final point, this is also why we are deeply committed to the [ORGANIZATION] campaign along with those 95 other agencies you've heard about to win a dedicated source of revenue to fund affordable housing locally. And we're here and we're gonna rely on your support urgently for that.",portland
07_09_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"and our coalition is in support of Commissioner [PERSON]'s bold resolution for incentive housing or zoning. As we approach this next generation of development through an equity lens, we must really ask ourselves, development for whom and equity for whom? Given the acknowledged and expanding post-recovering housing crisis, disparately impacting [ORGANIZATION]'s protected class population, specifically African Americans and Native Americans, and our local jurisdictional and state duty to affirmatively further fair housing, there's an urgent need to prioritize and direct this public benefit to affordable housing.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION] we've experienced highs and lows. The lows being the persistence of the bans on inclusionary zoning and rent control, which limit the tools at hand to strengthen tenant protections and provide affordable housing. The highs reflected in [ORGANIZATION]'s rulings on disparate impact and [ORGANIZATION], or Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"In light of the latter, we must remember that while prioritizing affordable housing is important, prioritizing the siting of affordable housing in areas of high opportunity is essential. The [ORGANIZATION] mandate sets a path for government to intentionally integrate low-income and protected class communities into areas of affluence and opportunity rather than continuing to suburbanize and concentrate poverty. One of the goals of the Fair Housing Act is to reduce segregation.",portland
07_09_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"In thinking about public-private partnerships and affordable housing, it's important to remember that [ORGANIZATION]'s duty to [ORGANIZATION] reads,  Although the grantee's [ORGANIZATION] obligation arises in connection with the receipt of federal funding, its [ORGANIZATION] obligation is not restricted to the design and operation of [ORGANIZATION]-funded programs at the state or local level. The [ORGANIZATION] obligation extends to all housing and housing-related activities in the grantee's jurisdictional area, whether publicly or privately funded. Thank you for considering this important first step in responding to our region's housing crisis.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has a long history of supporting affordable housing. In fact, I think the very first time I testified before you for this commission was in favor of the [ORGANIZATION] set asides. And we're generally supportive of Commissioner [PERSON]'s prioritizing of bonuses and transfers for affordable housing here.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"We therefore urge that any proposed affordable housing bonus program apply to households up to 100% MFI. We don't feel it necessary to eliminate many of the current bonus and transfer options to achieve the city's affordable housing goals. The current bonus and transfer system supports the city's goals for density, encourages amenities that support other city goals, and allows for greater architectural creativity.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Instead of removing bonus options such as those for bike storage facilities that are working, the city should explore mechanisms to incent and make more attractive a new affordable housing bonus. For example, the three to one cap on bonus FAR that can be used on a single site could be raised for affordable housing. If this additional entitlement were allowed, it would make this affordable housing bonus attractive to developers and [STREET] its use even among the other bonus options.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,You control most of the land. And the thing about it is that what I see here is that I like that affordable housing fund. I want to have a more understanding on kind of what your plans are when money goes into the fund.,portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"I think we all recognize that access to good jobs, transportation options, transportation  strong schools are the building blocks for family success without affordable housing in our most amenity-rich areas of the city we are in jeopardy of becoming a city that does not represent the values that [ORGANIZATION]ers share [ORGANIZATION] is missing a major tool in our toolbox the best practice that many cities already employ to develop affordable housing and that is the incentive zoning program the time is now to develop such a program And I would like to acknowledge and thank PERSON0 and [ORGANIZATION] for their hard work on this proposal.  from planning and sustainability [ORGANIZATION] sincere.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"And as I said at the outset, I tend to be impatient on these things, but I feel comforting in knowing that all of us will be watching very closely the clock on getting these proposals up and running and truly providing more affordable housing in our community. And [PERSON] of my office  Of course. How could I forget [PERSON] for her help as well?",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"So I personally would have said that we should have made it 0 to 60 because I think that would have made it much more likely that we would get more money into the affordable housing funds. But I am taking the advice of my constituents. And again, thank you, Commissioner [PERSON].",portland
07_09_2015,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Well, the affordable housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION] is really serious. And this proposal, Commissioner [PERSON], is a serious effort to use a complicated tool, our incentive program, to try to make a difference in that big complex issue. And [PERSON] may know this story.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON], thanks for your energy and leadership on this. I really appreciate it. I think this was overdue.  and to focus on affordable housing and to maybe make this complicated machine a little simpler and maybe a little more effective in the bargain is good public policy.",portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,I'm the safety manager for [ORGANIZATION]. I think it is ironic we are speaking just after the council heard affordable housing issues that affect this city. I believe that these recommendations that [ORGANIZATION] has recommended to you will add additional cost to those projects and with constraints to the development of future high-density housing.,portland
07_09_2015,affordable housing,"And like I said earlier, that equates to about one on the low end, 1.4 on the high end, 2.5 piles that we could install a day just from that [TIME]. So you have a rough sense of what the cost would be. I guess the second question I just want to ask, because, sir, you alluded to affordable housing.",portland

07_09_2015,affordable housing,"I live in a building where there are a lot of older people, and people in affordable housing are very often vulnerable and don't really have any [STREET] to go. I earn my living by providing support services for people with disabilities, and I can't really offer much technical expertise beyond what people have already talked about. I did present...  I submitted a letter to [ORGANIZATION] and I'd just like to quote from it briefly about public health.",portland

Only two states in the entire nation refused to provide this vital protection to their local citizens, [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON].

07_06_2016,affordable housing,"The generally accepted formula for pricing affordable housing units is derived from applying 60% of the region's [ORGANIZATION] median wage,  Unfortunately, [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] definition of affordable housing is households with incomes equal to or higher than 80% of the median family income. According to [ORGANIZATION], the median family income for a family of four in [LOCATION] was approximately $74,000 in [ORGANIZATION]. Applying the minimum 80% coefficient factor against the region's median wage for a family of four is equivalent to just under $60,000.",portland
07_06_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Our local affordable housing crisis will continue to exist as long as we allow retailers,  realtors and developers to use this higher threshold in the initial determination for pricing structures.

07_06_2016,homeless,okay great so that completes our communications and we're ready for our first uh time certain  good [TIME] sorry i'm late apologize for being late folks we just had a wonderful announcement this [TIME] between [ORGANIZATION] and the city of [PERSON] about opening another [ADDRESS] to stay so commissioner [PERSON] and everyone else are still doing great work and this was just one more sign of that,portland

07_06_2016,homeless; homelessness,"These services are critical to prevent families from losing their homes, helping communities of color purchase a home. to prevent further displacement, and to add to the safety net that supports low-income Portlanders who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. I don't know if you have any other words.",portland
07_06_2016,homeless,"But in general, I think that you guys are talking about taking a bunch of zombie houses for the city. I think if that's going to be the case, and if you do actually take a bunch of these houses and the city becomes the owner, I think you should put them in the hands of [ORGANIZATION] or other community agencies, maybe some other community groups that actually are working to house people and not make a profit from,  off the whole poverty, pimp, crisis, capitalism role model that seems to be fueling [ORGANIZATION]. And I think that actually a lot of these housing issues would be taken care of if there wasn't so much profit motive to keep people homeless and to keep housing prices so high and all that.",portland
07_06_2016,homeless; homelessness,"So basically, I don't think that the city should...  get ownership of these zombie houses that you call them. I think that they should actually be taken over by community organizations that actually aren't profit driven like [ORGANIZATION] and other people of that ilk that have turned poverty and homelessness into a major industry. I'd like to see people like ORG1 have more political power in this city, and I'd like to see you guys work with community organizations more than with these poverty-pimp corporations like ORG2, which also have patrols that go around and rustle the homeless [ORGANIZATION].  and call the police on the homeless and wage cultural war on the homeless.",portland
07_06_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"So, you know, maybe you guys could put some money into some real community organizations, and if you're going to take a bunch of these houses, put them in the hands of the community and...  and stop throwing away so much money with all these poverty pimp organizations because it's obviously not working. Thanks very much. And homelessness won't be solved with affordable housing.",portland
07_06_2016,homeless,"It's kind of like in downtown [ORGANIZATION]. I've been out there when I was homeless [ORGANIZATION]. I just don't, you know, since you have them, and then people are talking about using parks, why not just use these homes for right to dream, too, things like that.",portland
07_06_2016,homeless,"Since there were complaints from the neighbors anyway, in the first [STREET], if there are complaints because homeless people are there, then there's not much change, but at least people can...  A lot of homeowners don't want intrusion. Certainly, if there's any kind of disturbances, then the police can get involved. Thank you.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"I'll beat you to the punch. Okay. So next time [ORGANIZATION] proposes to put an affordable housing development in [ORGANIZATION] where there's a shortage of affordable units, we say to the folks who live there that they're not eligible for getting a parking permit because they came too late?",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"First of all, the [ORGANIZATION], which was made up of transit advocates, people who were very opposed to parking garages and fought them bitterly, and people who were in favor of parking garages, unanimously endorsed this proposal to have both the shared parking and the parking minimums. The parking minimums were not established in our neighborhood at the time when they were established everywhere else. We had a lot of discussions about ways to improve the parking minimums, like eliminating the requirement for affordable housing,  or giving credits for bus passes or doing a variety of things.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"As you weigh the alternatives, I would like to encourage you to consider the following key points. First,  First, there appears to be minimal correlation, if any, between the ratio of parking spaces provided to new units and [ORGANIZATION] rent. Affordable housing advocates are adamant that requiring parking increases the cost of housing.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"However, actual pricing reflects a number of factors, and the practical reality is, as Commissioner [PERSON] just mentioned, that rents are about the same in northwest [ORGANIZATION] with or without parking. So the net economic benefit of pushing the parking burden to the streets primarily accrues to developers and not to those who are seeking affordable housing. You'll also note that Commissioner [PERSON], just [TIME], said that scarcity is what's driving rents, not cost.",portland
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"I have two cars. My family has two cars anyway. And I am coming to speak out against the minimum parking requirements because we are in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis, and I think that anything that increases the cost of housing and restricts the supply is something that should be avoided at all costs.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"I just ran it by [ORGANIZATION], and he didn't tell me to leave the building. I'm going to get your reactions. what if we just said the parking minimums do not apply to affordable housing and if you're building a unit that that serves someone at 0 to 60 of medium family income which is where the greatest need is we said that um and and you have you enter into a regulatory agreement to keep you know that doesn't run afoul of rent control which we're preempted from doing right now tell me overturn that ban",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"And the truth is lots of things add to the cost of housing, even for affordable housing. Especially for affordable housing, right? There's a lot of social costs built in.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"But I'm trying to get philosophically what you would think about having a minimum but not applying it to affordable housing. I mean, certainly in principle, I don't oppose that at all. I think that's a great idea.",portland
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"It's the additional units in that building which are going to help more than the lack of parking construction currently. This is a policy that should be reformed or repealed and not expanded, especially during a housing crisis. Unlike neighborhoods, in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has a toolbox full of parking management strategies at its disposal,  expanded permit zones, new meters, and after the recommended shared parking that we're asking for.",portland
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"And pretty soon we should have better permit programs available as well. So I think there's much less risk right now in waiting to see how these more flexible and equitable policies play out and then adjust them to work better rather than applying a policy that might not really help very much and certainly will exacerbate the housing crisis. Um, so I think that's, that's really, um, I, there's some evidence that when you, when you talk about how we're going to get people out of their cars, um,  When you look at transit-oriented developments that have access to cheap parking, people don't give up their cars.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"That's not how, you will shift the momentum if you give in to this request for bad policy to placate some neighbors. I,  One other point I want to touch on that's not really in the bike walk vote purview is this affordable housing issue. I think that there's a lot of focus placed on MFI, less than 60%, but there are really good reasons to want...  market rate housing to be affordable for the middle class.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"And when you think about affordable housing, there are lots of different definitions, but I think you should absolutely be considering the people who will live in those 350 square foot apartments in the 120 unit building. I think those people should be given consideration, too, because we don't want just those people who are eligible and then the very wealthy to live in it. We want a spectrum of people.",portland
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"You may wonder why does someone from [ORGANIZATION] care about what's going on in [LOCATION]? Well, a couple of things. One is that our whole city is in a housing crisis.",portland
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"But in my neighborhood, I'm seeing my middle-income neighbors displaced or moving because of this housing crisis. So I wanted to just make that point because this policy will affect, in the short term, middle-income people more. but they are also being displaced and affected by this housing crisis.",portland
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"So it represents, in essence, an indirect tax on the people who are most affected by the housing crisis. And in terms of equity, in terms of rationing, as has been discussed, I do want to also reiterate that if you look at census data in [ORGANIZATION], it is low-income people that tend to walk or use transit the most as their transportation mode. So I really want to strongly urge you to reject what I view as an unfair and unequal indirect tax on lower- and middle-income people.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,I do acknowledge that some of the exceptions in the framework are flawed and that the provision of affordable housing should be one of those exceptions. It is encouraging that the bike town program will have a strong presence in [ORGANIZATION]. A proposed crosstown bus route using [ORGANIZATION] should also be popular.,portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,I'm a supporter of affordable housing and sensible parking policy. I want both. I believe both goals are achievable and compatible with a simple policy change.,portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"It's essentially the one that's been raised here as an alternative a couple times already [ORGANIZATION]. I believe it's oversimplified, if not inaccurate, to suggest that no parking equals lower rent. In fact, I think the absence of parking minimums simply opens the door to increased developer profits and does not assure more affordable housing in our tight housing market.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"we need to make sure that the savings accrued by not building off-[STREET] parking are passed along to renters and the public simply not captured by developers who choose not to provide parking i believe there's a fairly straightforward solution permits should not be readily available to residents of new market rate developments that don't offer off-[STREET] parking it's a win-win-win developers who argue that their renters don't have cars are not required to provide parking  Renters who don't have cars aren't required to pay for it, and the public isn't burdened with the cost of increased demand for limited on-[STREET] parking. The market will pair renters who don't own cars with more affordable developments that don't offer parking. And I think, as [ORGANIZATION]'s raised, exceptions and incentives could be made for affordable housing units.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"So I encourage the city council to evaluate and implement some type of plan like this, which will assure more affordable housing and not worsen the already difficult parking situation in northwest [ORGANIZATION]. In the meantime, regarding this timing issue, I do support parking minimums as a tourniquet. It's an imperfect but important tool that will help us balance parking supply and demand in the short term while we find a more comprehensive set of policies and programs that can be deployed in the longer term.",portland
07_06_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"The pathway, as you've heard from the experts here, that we should be taking, there are many, many other things that we should be requiring and trying out first before construction, especially when we're in the midst of an affordable housing crisis. I know that you all realize the urgency and the importance of dealing with that housing crisis. I thank you very much for your recent efforts in that area with the excise tax, referring the affordable housing bond to voters in [ORGANIZATION], and all the other actions you've taken in [LOCATION].",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"So many of our places are market rate, but recently in [ORGANIZATION], we're approved for the affordable housing component. So that's what we're going to continue to do. I can't say that's the driving factor for parking,  because then what does that do as the previous gentleman said about the market rate units those are going to go up",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"so if you don't get the cost will have to be recovered in some [STREET] we wrote a letter to uh [ORGANIZATION] and i'm just going to briefly go pat through this just to state um the parking requirements for the northwest district would have a serious negative impact on the future supply of the affordable housing if passed and housing as a whole the ability to create new affordable urban rental housings with escalating land costs  the increased permit costs, increased labor wages, increased material costs, and we just passed increased taxes for our construction. It's already a serious constraint, and yet we're asking for us to reduce the rent costs. I mean, the costs are the cost.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"Some of the census tracts in the heart of [ORGANIZATION] have median incomes of just $28,000 or $35,000, which is far below the citywide average. In the neighbourhood as a whole, 76.3% of the housing units are occupied by renters, myself included. I live in a [ORGANIZATION] apartment building, which is typical of the market rate, but relatively affordable housing that can be found throughout the neighbourhood.",portland
07_06_2016,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION] added parking minimums in much of the rest of the city in [LOCATION]. We're now [LOCATION] into that experiment, but according to ORG1 Director [PERSON], when she was speaking to ORG2 in [DATE], no analysis has been done by the city to date on what effect that's had in affordability. Since [PERSON], we've been in a declared housing crisis, and I don't think now is the right time to further experiment with adding parking minimums back into city code.",portland
07_06_2016,housing crisis,Of course we need more housing. We're in a housing crisis. We need less cars.,portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"Frankly, if something like that weren't built in our neighborhood, I'd be thrilled. I'd be happy if Commissioner [PERSON] or [PERSON] were able to build a whole bunch of affordable housing units with or without parking. And I agree with Commissioner [PERSON] that those units should be exempted from the minimum parking requirements.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"I live at FAC0 and FAC1 in [ORGANIZATION]. I was listening to the folks who are advocating for the status quo, and I was thinking we all share the same goals, which are less cars, less pollution, more truly affordable housing, and more income diversity in the neighborhood. I am a proponent of a –  code revision to include the parking minimums in the [ORGANIZATION] District for all kinds of different reasons, but primarily so we are taken into the city.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"On that issue of affordability, speaking to Commissioner [PERSON]'s point,  Our group is interested in affordable housing both in the subsidized category and in the low end of market, market rate category. And parking requirements, obligations affect both of those things. They make it more difficult to keep rents down in both of those categories of housing.",portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,These parking minimums are the only thing we can now use to keep the 30 pending units that are on these maps from overwhelming the existing parking out there. I don't want higher rents. I don't want to lose affordable housing.,portland
07_06_2016,affordable housing,"And I certainly share the concerns about the impact on affordable housing, and that's something I want to try to understand better, too, in [ORGANIZATION]. Mayor, if I could just add a comment. The one thing that I'm clearer about at the end of this hearing is I don't think the affordable housing component is a top three factor in this discussion.",portland

08_30_2017,affordable housing,"Do you have anything additional to say about that?

09_14_2016,homelessness,"I'd like to start by thanking [ORGANIZATION] for their efforts to acquire and preserve [ORGANIZATION], as well as Commissioner [PERSON], and to note our support of the acquisition of this critical housing resource. Homelessness is a complex issue. There are individual factors, such as poverty or job loss or addiction, and then there are structural factors, such as shifting and insufficient public mental health approaches.",portland
09_14_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"One of the most critical structural causes for homelessness is the loss of affordable housing. DATE0, the [ORGANIZATION] lost over 3 million low-income housing units, including a loss of over 2 million single-room occupancy, or [ORGANIZATION], housing units. These are typically the lowest barrier housing units available in a community, often offering DATE1 or [ORGANIZATION] rental options with low or no screening or application barriers.",portland
09_14_2016,homelessness,"And not surprisingly, the increase in homelessness in this country largely mirrors this loss of affordable low-barrier [ORGANIZATION] housing. To provide some perspective, [ORGANIZATION] lost 50% of their [ORGANIZATION] stock over this timeframe. [PERSON] lost 60%.",portland
09_14_2016,homelessness,"Here in [ORGANIZATION], we've lost about 75%. While [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] lost about 90% of their [ORGANIZATION] stock and saw homelessness dramatically increase.

09_14_2016,affordable housing,"We know that there is a difference between the housing that the market delivers and affordable housing, which is why we invest in affordable housing.

08_05_2015,affordable housing,"In terms of the cap and whether there is [ORGANIZATION] support for that, I think that that's there conceptually because they understand the need for predictability as well as clearly the desperation for affordable housing.

[INSTITUTION] their nonprofit community we're not going to be able to solve uh... this affordable housing crisis without getting the private sector engaged uh... as uh... commissioners also been pointed out there's only two tools right now on one is the uh...  the [ORGANIZATION] waivers, and the other is this program.",portland
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"It's not obviously going to solve our affordable housing problem in the city, but it's a great step in the right direction. And we've had a few lately. The FAR bonus is another one.",portland
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"So...  When ordinances are crafted or when we work with this, I hope that we'll follow Commissioner [PERSON]'s idea that we could have the city attorney office bring forth a report to share with this council and with the county commissioners showing that legally there is a basis for us to reclaim any property tax waivers, abatements, or whatever that are granted to people who start off providing affordable housing and  and then feel like, oh, I really absolutely positively need to have 100 percent market rate property. There should be, as the other gentleman from [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, some stick to go with hopefully a delicious carrot. That's not yet.",portland
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"I appreciate the points that have been raised in the testimony and by Commissioner [PERSON], and we will certainly take a close look at those, and Mr. [PERSON] also about aspirational goals for minority participation. But I think this is a good program. You know, 200 units of affordable housing a year is not going to solve the problem.",portland
08_05_2015,affordable housing,"But as [ORGANIZATION] said, things are starting to come together in pieces that are slowly here and there, I think, going to be producing more affordable housing in a time when we have a red-hot market that needs more.  proper incentives if we're going to get the amount of affordable housing that we truly need to serve all of our residents in [ORGANIZATION]. So this is a great step forward. I look forward to the county's consideration and hopeful approval of this as well.",portland
09_13_2017,homelessness,"I just want you to know that. What we're talking about [ORGANIZATION] is not about homelessness, houselessness, et cetera. It's about behavior.",portland
09_13_2017,homeless,"Mr. [PERSON] and Commissioners, I come before you on behalf of the [ORGANIZATION] neighbors, at least two entities on [ORGANIZATION] [STREET], my family, and really countless businesses and other persons, including certain homeless who have seen their neighborhood afflicted by an unchecked threat to our health, safety, and livelihood. Excuse me. I refer specifically to rampant illegal and unsafe behavior in southeast [PERSON] by certain bad actors.",portland
09_13_2017,homeless,"I am not anti-homeless. I am anti-criminal. The focus is not on the person but the behavior, and there are plenty of behaviors that you should consider.",portland
09_13_2017,homeless,"I can represent that a nascent electoral coalition is budding, nourished along the spectrum of nuisances to outrages and the perceived lack of concrete and permanent steps undertaken by our leaders. An expansion in homeless and transit programs combined with a more robust police presence must occur to promote health and safety. I highlight community policing cannot occur without more police.",portland
09_13_2017,homelessness,"So the second thing I just want to mention is in the most recent point in time, none of us here are tolerant of behavior that crosses the line into illegal behavior, wherever it happens, and the mayor has been very clear about enforcing the law. But I will say one thing we have learned in [ORGANIZATION], and it's the same up and down the coast, is there has been a huge growth in what we call chronic homelessness. And the data that you know, because it was published, is people that are battling addiction or mental health crises or both, the dual diagnosis.",portland
09_13_2017,affordable housing,"Recommended actions in this update are to set a fee for smaller homes similar to multifamily homes. The program will also continue to exempt affordable housing permanently, as well as accessory dwelling units through [ORGANIZATION]. Moreover, we think there is merit to the [ORGANIZATION] beginning to collect new person trip data from a variety of housing types, such that more varied rates can be set in future updates.",portland
09_13_2017,affordable housing,"Give me a magic wand and I'll wave it and so be it. I think the mayor is probably –  My guess is the mayor's persuaded that's a good idea. Yeah, I think it would be a perfect informative tool to use in how we plan because we talk about affordable housing, low-cost housing, all those things, yet you don't, talking with [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and ORG2, you know, they have all different kinds of fees that are waived that they have to pay, those kinds of things.",portland
09_13_2017,affordable housing,This rate structure creates a clear incentive for developers to build smaller and therefore more affordable housing. We understand and support the new methodology using person trips to calculate [ORGANIZATION] rates. [ORGANIZATION] used data from [ORGANIZATION] showing large dwelling units having more people in them on average.,portland
07_26_2017,homeless,"Everything we're talking about when we were talking about homeless issues on the last resolution is all involved in that plan. Everything we're talking about on poverty reduction is all involved in that plan. And we need to start understanding, especially from [ORGANIZATION], when you have people  Like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] saying now is the time to begin to implement this.",portland
07_26_2017,homeless,"We need to have these type of committees researching, planning, and looking over things to understand the greatest thing that can happen. And let's use a pilot project. Let's just talk to begin with on doing something for the chronic homeless in the city of [ORGANIZATION], but on a universal level through [PERSON].",portland
07_12_2017,homelessness,"Number two, I completely understand and empathize with the concerns that you have raised. And the budget that we just passed reflects that concern. We are being compassionate with regard to our response to homelessness.",portland
07_12_2017,affordable housing,"[PERSON], amend relocation assistance regulations in affordable housing preservation and [ORGANIZATION] renter protections. Colleagues, first I'd like to present an amendment to swap out what was filed in the 710 amendments. That, as you will recall, was a minor fix.",portland
07_12_2017,housing crisis,"Therefore, it's up to us to continue to take bold action to address this housing crisis using the tools that we currently have at our disposal, like mandatory relocation assistance. In [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] mandated that landlords in [ORGANIZATION] pay relocation assistance to tenants experiencing rent increases of 10% or more and tenants being evicted for no cause. There was an abundance of public testimony from housing justice advocates, community groups, and landlords and tenants alike, and it became clear that the community at large had a handful of outstanding questions about the mandatory relocation assistance legislation.",portland
07_12_2017,housing crisis,"I'm sure it's no secret that this ordinance is one of the only almost ready-to-go tools we have available for us to address this housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION]. As an organization that's been representing most impacted renters for [ORGANIZATION], we're ecstatic to know that this is a long-term policy in consideration by the council. We look forward to shepherding policies like this in other jurisdictions around the state and look forward to participating in conversations about what a long-term strategy would look like.",portland
07_12_2017,homeless,"I didn't last there, and then I'm a veteran. Now I'm under [PERSON] and I'm on food stamps. But I do think that if – I think the economy of the future will get worse and we will have more homeless people.",portland
07_12_2017,homeless,"And it's one advantage, you know, in [ORGANIZATION] when people were homeless, we do have a lot of this what I call crystal magic, people's ability to get electricity from the sun, telecommute. I know some people actually write programs that have made $50,000 on an [ORGANIZATION] phone. So it's amazing how you can do that and be another [ORGANIZATION] or somebody like that.",portland
07_12_2017,housing insecurity,"And that's union, it's represented and non. And no one should work full time in this city and face housing insecurity or basically poverty anymore. [ORGANIZATION] provide good jobs for the community.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,Request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding opening a nonprofit business to benefit the homeless. Good morning. Welcome.,portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"Good morning. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm here to talk about the growing homeless population in [ORGANIZATION]. I've lived here for [ORGANIZATION], and in that [ORGANIZATION], I've seen it triple, triple.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"Um, I myself am homeless. I've been homeless for [ORGANIZATION]. Um, I do have a job.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"I'm having a real difficult time finding grants, or I don't know how to write a grant, nor do I have the money for a grant writer to open up a second-hand store, much like [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], to benefit the homeless. I work in a second-hand store. I've seen the amount of money they bring in.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"I think it could benefit the homeless population by, you know,  bringing in money through the store and purchasing apartment complexes, houses, to put the homeless in these buildings, in these structures, and give them the jobs at the store. The apartments, the living situations can also provide more jobs and help people get off the streets. A lot of people seem to think that most of the homeless are drug addicts, alcoholics, which is not true.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"Where we're staying, there are many, many homeless families living in their cars. We're chased out of parking lots. We have nowhere to go.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"They're the homeless action team in my office, and if you would talk with one of them, let them know how to get in touch with you, and they might be able to put you in touch with some resources that you haven't found yet. Okay. Appreciate you coming.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"I do, however, want to throw out a different [STREET] of looking at the approach. I had proposed to the [ORGANIZATION] commissioners that they needed to move into the tents and let the humans move into tents  the buildings and then approach their government through tents and see how effective they'd be. And you might say that that $288,330 might be better spent buying some kind of warmer blanket  for the homeless.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"And I'm not trying to be the devil's advocate because I don't think the homeless are the devil. But as you can imagine, this kind of a blanket is not very warm, but it does look a little bit like a tinfoil hat for a tech generation. I mean, it's kind of glam rock, kind of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"Hopefully, we know there are other homeless activists who have presented in the past about people who have died from exposure and substance abuse while homeless. And I haven't heard any of those horror stories, so I hope that we had [ORGANIZATION]. But, yeah.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"I think this is a matter that other people and I, myself, need to take under advisement. We're in a city that has thousands of people sleeping on the streets outside, presents on its budget and says, oh, we budgeted $600,000 for shelter-type services and we didn't expend it, but don't worry, it'll be there at [ORGANIZATION], right? It certainly doesn't seem to dovetail with the pronouncements about a homeless state of emergency.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,Take it out on homeless people. We'll get it from the feds. Am I wrong on this?,portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"We'll read these together, but let's do 705 separately. Okay, let's take [DATE], please.  authorize an intergovernmental agreement with [ORGANIZATION] to establish [ORGANIZATION]. Well, this is [ORGANIZATION], and I appreciate the good work that's been done between the city and the county.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Thank you.  for the creation of [ORGANIZATION]. I think in [ORGANIZATION], I've observed the city and the county have had unprecedented levels of collaboration to address crises involving families and individuals experiencing homelessness. And it's time to take this collaboration to the next level by forming [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_22_2016,affordable housing,"A joint combined system will be more efficient, more nimble, and most importantly of all, be easier to navigate for those in desperate need of our assistance and services. In working towards completing this agreement, the chair and I have shared four basic principles—  first and foremost, create a new joint office that would be situated to serve its clients, the men, women, and children who need safe, stable, and affordable housing. Secondly, we had a get-or-done approach.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"The [ORGANIZATION] you are voting on [ORGANIZATION] implements a vision of deepened city-county collaboration to address homelessness that has existed for [ORGANIZATION], but started to become even stronger with the creation of a home for everyone two [ORGANIZATION] ago. It represents an important opportunity to deliver on the commitment we have made to people experiencing homelessness, that we will do everything we can to support their efforts to get off the streets and back into permanent housing. Just as we know that how our providers deliver services is as important to achieving successful outcomes as the resources that they have available, how we organize the work that we do at the governmental level profoundly affects our ability to achieve the best possible outcomes for people experiencing homelessness.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,[ORGANIZATION] will change how we organize our work in ways that will have significant positive impacts on the effectiveness of our efforts to address homelessness. [ORGANIZATION] will bring together on one team the city and county staff with the greatest expertise and the deepest commitment to ending homelessness. That team will be guided by the same vision and values that guide the larger ORG1 initiative.,portland
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"We will come to work [ORGANIZATION] committed to creating a community where homelessness is rare, brief, and one time because everyone has access to a safe, affordable, and accessible housing unit. [ORGANIZATION]... We'll use the existing and unprecedented increased city and county investments in homeless services to build a system of care that helps thousands of people [ORGANIZATION] escape homelessness.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"Specifically, once fully implemented, the system will help more than 4,300 people a year move off the streets and out of shelters and back into permanent housing. It will help at least 5,600 people a year avoid homelessness altogether through improved prevention and diversion strategies. and we will be able to offer at least 650 additional safety off the streets options, shelter options [TIME] to people who have not yet been able to find permanent housing.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"This office will focus resources on those who are most vulnerable and prioritize the elimination of the significant overrepresentation of communities of color in the population of people experiencing homelessness. We will continue to strengthen the community-led planning work that occurs within a home for everyone,  More specifically, we will be expanding the role of people with lived experience of homelessness, the faith, philanthropic, and business communities in helping us realize the creation of a community where everyone has access to safe, affordable, and accessible housing. We will work to create the most efficient and equitable contracting process for our community-based organizations that deliver homeless services.  and ensure that collectively and individually, we are accountable to the community for the outcomes that we commit to achieving and are continuously engaged in evaluating and improving the quality of services that we deliver.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"We will strengthen the ongoing collaboration with the other critical government agencies that touch the lives of people who are or are likely to experience homelessness. We will work closely with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to address the need for deeply affordable and permanent supportive housing. We will work [ORGANIZATION] with ORG2 to make sure that individuals and families are moving seamlessly between homeless and anti-poverty, aging, disability, and veteran services.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"We will work closely with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], and other criminal justice partners to address the needs of homeless people who they are coming into contact with. And there will be a close working relationship between [LOCATION] and the county's mental health and addiction services, looking for opportunities to better align critical health and housing resources. And finally, this office will strengthen our partnerships at the state and federal levels.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"We want to sustain the tremendous success that we've had with the effort to end veterans homelessness and we will use [ORGANIZATION] to pursue opportunities to collaborate on similar upcoming federal initiatives to end family, youth, and chronic homelessness. The success of [ORGANIZATION]  will depend on staying true to the collaborative nature of the office itself. The fact that this is an ongoing shared effort of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON].",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"It will also depend on realizing the opportunity for expanded collaboration that it offers at every level with people experiencing homelessness, non-governmental community partners, and the other local, state, and federal government partners we have. Getting to this point has not been easy. but I couldn't be more excited that we've arrived here.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] will not by itself solve the crisis of homelessness that we are experiencing in our community, but it gives us the best opportunity to maximize the collective impact of our efforts and to take the resources available and help as many people as possible successfully escape homelessness. Good morning, Mayor, Commissioners. My name is [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"I'm the county's chief operating officer, and I'm just going to give you a brief summary of the highlights of the intergovernmental agreement we're asking you to approve [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] has an initial [PERSON] term. It transfers existing city contracts for homeless services to [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_22_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Hello. The creation of [ORGANIZATION] is the contemporary local government equivalent to FAC0. We have a clear and compelling vision, and that clear and compelling vision is to decrease by half the unmet housing need amongst people experiencing homelessness throughout [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"The [ORGANIZATION] mission going forward will be different. Somewhat narrower, but more impactful, we'll be able to focus on housing production, preservation, tenant services, eviction prevention, and we'll be able to align our resources, capital and operating resources, to focus on our mission, which will include permanent supportive housing. We will also maintain an ongoing commitment for the homeless management information system, because it's braided within our larger policy and program development construct.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,Thank you. And the other thing I'd like to recognize is the homeless assistance and resource team itself within [ORGANIZATION]. This was something that they fully subscribed to at the outset.,portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"I'll speak for the city. I think... DATE0 on the job [PERSON] was to read all historic documents related to the management of homeless services in the city and in the county, including the [ORGANIZATION] report, which recommended this alignment of resources.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"And in my opinion, and to the many people out there in the community who I speak to on a [DATE] basis, ending homelessness, getting people off the streets and into housing is the number one priority of the citizens we serve. I'm not saying that they don't want police and fire. I know that they want that as well, but I think that people want us –  to do our best to help get people off the streets.",portland
06_22_2016,houseless,"But [ORGANIZATION] is not mentioned. Certainly the facility will continue to be managed by ORG1 per the agreement that...  whoever owns it is going to continue to manage it. But there's going to be some ongoing operating funds that [ORGANIZATION] 2 will have to have, because they're going to not only do what they do now, but they'll have services like laundries and showers and such, which other houseless people who are, wants to get a shower will be able to come.",portland
06_22_2016,houseless,"Okay. I just want to make sure that that is seen as a service for houseless people and therefore likely to be funded or if you could promise for it to be funded, that would be great. What about the single points of contact that the mayor's office currently has for people reporting concerns about people living outside or people needing services?",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"How is that going to be handled? So, at this point, that is, again, that hasn't been in the category of things that [ORGANIZATION] just mentioned in terms of recognizing that there are a variety of services that are being performed that touch homelessness. Maybe they stay where they are currently located.",portland
06_22_2016,houseless,to do culturally specific outreach to houseless people. It's not perfect. It still needs work.,portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"And I say that because [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON2 and everybody involved in the ending homelessness team on our side of the river, in my mind, has always been one of the bright lights of our work on this side of the river. And plus, they're not just focused on ending homelessness. They've provided a values proposition for all of our work.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"So every time we took something up, they were there reminding us that homelessness had to be at the forefront of what we were doing. So for me, it's really important [ORGANIZATION] that they have given the green light to this exercise. And that would not be, I think the case had not all this work gone into the details and to this soft landing.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"There's something very powerful when we're all sitting together and getting the same presentation. May I propose a friendly amendment that we have at least an [DATE] joint session where the home for everyone, including the performance and update on the joint office for homelessness, is addressed? And we do it at a time that's enough upstream so that we can anticipate budget issues ahead of our formal budget process.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"So I appreciate that you have set a floor, and you've been very honest with us that that's the minimum resources you're going to need to do the job, because we should not ask you to do this job unless we're making that commitment. And I would just note, because there's a precedent for this, in [ORGANIZATION], this council, without an identified source of resources, converted all the one-time money for homelessness to ongoing. In fact, it was one of the presents that was handed to Mayor [PERSON] when he came into office.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"This is about...  transformational change. And I've done homeless services and housing development for [ORGANIZATION]. Not often do you see one branch of government giving up authority, giving up budget authority.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], just sit down and give us your name, [ORGANIZATION], and tell us what's on your mind. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]. I'm homeless also, and there are two blocks.  that have remained vacant for [ORGANIZATION] in back of the old FAC0, and they'd make an excellent encampment for most probably all, all of the people that are camping on the sidewalk.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"No, no, you can say something right now. They're designated as a park. Well, no, no, but there are homeless people, and that's an emergency.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"Well, no, there are homeless people, though, Mayor [PERSON]. But they take priority, I would say, I'm sure. And this would cost less than a million dollars.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"Homelessness doesn't need to be commodified as the people are charging you so much money for this. You said something in the first [ORGANIZATION] article. You wanted to do something with a lot of things that would cost less.  that this would work, and no one has told me why not.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"It's to authorize an intergovernmental agreement with [ORGANIZATION] to establish [ORGANIZATION] for  the ordinance introduced by Commissioner [PERSON], which, interestingly enough, you can actually convert that amazing emergency blanket into a superhero cape. It really looks fabulous. We pulled that off at the last co-op.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"I don't know, that well-spoken gentleman back there, well, there were a few of them, you too, but the other one, they, I don't know what's his salary, [ORGANIZATION] and we're not through this homeless epidemic. I'm [PERSON], so...  this is, to me, it seems like we're keeping the poverty going because of the poverty industry. And the whole notion of social cleansing, when you bring up your favorite philosopher, what was his name, [ORGANIZATION]?",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"We could have a very interesting philosophy lecture that would go on for [TIME] discussing that, but it comes as a slap in the face to the community that has seen your draconian regime of Stalinist arrests of activists, arrests of homeless activists, as an attempt to gag our participation in the process. So you guys probably never wanted to be a camp leader of a sort of a camp vibe, and... As a consumer of poverty services, I can say sometimes they're not working well and that I'm frustrated by the socialism of the [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,For us to be thanking ourselves because we're helping the homeless is shameful. We need to be ashamed of ourselves that we're even speaking about people that are homeless. Not thanking ourselves for something that hasn't even happened yet.,portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,So  I'm kind of at a disagreement with you on thinking purchasing properties for the city is the answer to decreasing homelessness. Adding more inventory is going to be the answer so you don't keep driving up the rents. We need more inventory in the marketplace.,portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"That's why, again, I want to start seeing more talks with people like [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], certain investors from the private sector willing to step up, do homeless campuses, devote a tremendous amount of money, And that's the direction we really need to focus on. Thank you.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"i think he mentioned is a little bit less than that but my main point is that um  What we haven't had here are any metrics. When the [ORGANIZATION] plan for homelessness started [STREET] [DATE], I don't know if it had any metrics in it either. If it didn't and we don't now, we would be repeating the same mistake.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"But when you start a project, it's great to have a goal of ending homelessness. But when you're going to pay people  $78,000 salaries for people who've been on the payroll since [ORGANIZATION], $86,000 salaries for people who've been on the payroll since [LOCATION]. It's good to have metrics towards those results as a proportion of the overall picture.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"And it's very difficult here in [ORGANIZATION] because we have a growing population. It's hard to find accurate data about how –  homeless populations are impacted in areas that are experiencing an economic boom. But I hope that the next time that one of these confabs happen, there will be greater specifics and hopefully some success numbers where we can actually talk about hundreds of people reduced in the number of people sleeping outside and more people in permanent supportive housing that aren't rent burdened.",portland
06_22_2016,homeless,"And I especially want to thank our homeless assistance and resource team, or otherwise known as [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] team. I read [ORGANIZATION] where the new mayor of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], has to deal with one problem, or many problems, but one of the problems is that  On [LOCATION], 25% of city employees in [ORGANIZATION] don't show up for work. That's a problem.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,Why don't we combine city and county efforts on homelessness? But it's the kind of thing that in practice is incredibly difficult. It requires enormous commitment from a large number of people.,portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"Well, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], all of you, thank you again. Let me make a couple of contextual comments here at the end. One is that I think it's important to remember that this action is of a piece with our larger effort here on housing and homelessness, and it's also of a piece with what's happening nationally.  and first think back to what we've done together over [ORGANIZATION] to show our commitment to this issue.",portland
06_22_2016,affordable housing,"One, we declared a state of emergency. Two, we increased our commitment of tax increment resources to affordable housing to something that,  I don't think any other city has done. That is 45% of all remaining [ORGANIZATION] funds, some $340 million dedicated to affordable housing projects that are now starting to happen.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"Again, good work. The [ORGANIZATION] model that has led to this collaboration [ORGANIZATION] and the budget commitments that the city and the county and [ORGANIZATION] and others have been making. So there's a local effort here that this is consistent with,  It's also consistent with the national dialogue, and I want to let you know that my commitment for DATE1 that I'm serving in this office will be to continue to both support that local effort and to continue the national dialogue, because we have a homelessness problem, and I think it's important to remember that so do a lot of other cities.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,"And that's why we gathered the [ORGANIZATION] mayors here back in [ORGANIZATION] to talk among our colleagues about what are they doing, what's working. And in fact, [ORGANIZATION] and you, [PERSON], and I flew down and looked at  another model of how homelessness can be addressed in [ORGANIZATION]. That hunger continues on my part of where can we find another good idea, where can we share a best practice, and obviously [ORGANIZATION] that we successfully met together is one example of where cities around the country are trying to do similar good work.",portland
06_22_2016,homelessness,So DATE0 I'm going to go to the [ORGANIZATION] meeting and  be at the ORG1 meeting and once again try to find more tools that we can put to work here. But I think that national discussion among cities that are all trying to do this work at a time where the national homelessness challenge is huge.  is a good idea. So you've got my commitment both to keep this progress going locally and to keep that constructive dialogue going nationally that I think has served us well.,portland

And by providing this program ongoing [DATE] with a continued amount of  expected foregone revenue, we're able to maintain a portfolio of this number of affordable units, even as others expire and new ones would get approved. So even though it's not a program that's able to serve the lowest income people, up to 30% median family income, as we've talked about with the homeless issues [LOCATION], or people transitioning out of homelessness, this is part of the continuum to...  do work for the community in the spectrum of housing outside of what [ORGANIZATION] is able to affect through direct funding.",portland

09_14_2017,affordable housing,"You've heard plenty of testimony not to increase building heights since it promotes teardowns of existing affordable housing and historic architecture. The notion that some historic buildings could be saved by transferring FARs to nearby parcels is highly concerning for me, as it will only exacerbate an erratic height differential rather than building mass that is based on that human-scaled civic space. I'm speaking not only from an analytical mind that focuses on the statistics, economic analysis, housing targets, and employment numbers, but I urge you to allow your intuitive, perceptual minds to make decisions too.",portland

09_14_2017,affordable housing,"so long as there is certainty that the projects can actually get the additional FAR outlined in the framework and regulatory layers and costs are not amended in. The current FAR transfer requirement is what introduces uncertainty into whether a project can actually get the additional density needed to build beyond the base FAR and achieve the affordable housing and seismic support for historic properties the plan prioritizes, and we support it. [ORGANIZATION] has submitted written testimony that goes into more detail, but [PERSON] should add certainty and remove the barrier of requiring site-to-site transfer for additional [ORGANIZATION] by simply allowing [ORGANIZATION] up to the height limit.",portland

07_10_2019,affordable housing,So I don't have any concerns on this.

07_27_2016,homeless,"We've had some very attentive park rangers that helped resolve the issue. And I realized that what we're doing, we're criminalizing the homeless and making  I have a friend that lives on the same block as [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], incredible, beautiful craftsman home. And she said, you know, if I was homeless, I'd be doing drugs too.",portland
07_27_2016,homeless,"These people that are homeless need stability. Okay. More than anything else, they need stability.",portland
07_27_2016,homeless,"I am a public safety policy analyst with [ORGANIZATION]. This [PERSON] would be a contract with ORG2 to remove solid waste at camping sites established by homeless individuals on public property. Since [ORGANIZATION], ORG2 has worked closely with other local government agencies and law enforcement to investigate and remove illegal dumps.",portland
07_27_2016,homeless,"Keep coming back to it, yeah. Okay, go ahead and give us your name, and you have [TIME]. I'm [PERSON], and I disagree with PERSON1 about things and the other homeless person since I was homeless.",portland
07_27_2016,homeless,I think these homeless camps on [ORGANIZATION] need to stop. There's a lot of littering and stuff like that. This isn't about the homeless camps.,portland
07_27_2016,homeless,"Well, I encourage this, and I am going to go over to FAC0 and FAC1 and check out this homeless building that's being made where people can go there instead of sleeping outdoors. Now, here's what I'm saying also. Right near there is –  [ORGANIZATION], there's a bounty now on cans and bottles that keep them from being dumped in the woods.",portland
07_27_2016,homeless,All you have to do is watch the embankments along there and see refuse. And it is an interesting situation where we don't know the source of that litter and trash. And I think homeless people may get scapegoated.,portland
07_27_2016,homeless,"So I hope that as this project goes through and is managed, that we'll learn to be diligent and find out,  What is stuff left by homeless people who have no trash service? I mean, we'd like to – and what is stuff that other people who have homes but aren't willing to pay for their trash service have put in places where we maybe attribute that to the wrong people? Thank you.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"Item 877. Okay. Authorize an intergovernmental agreement with [ORGANIZATION] to provide $96,999 in grant resources for a feasibility analysis on potential pay-for-success funding models to support the connection between affordable housing interventions and improved health outcomes for low-income households.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"the division corridor will be a transportation lifeline that will connect this whole southeast area much better with more frequent service with better buses that are longer but not wider on interdivision just the same width that will be able to move more people on each trip that will reduce the number of passed by passengers in close in division and and make the the  speed of the movement through the entire corridor better for [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] residents. And it'll deal with the capacity issues and the need for more transit service in that area. But fundamentally, it's making real progress in areas that the city and the region need to progress toward, toward ensuring that there are places where people can live,  as areas become more prosperous, that the supply of affordable housing and the opportunities to stay in a community rather than be displaced from it are increased as we make strategic public investments.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"Okay. So, the part of the plan that we're focusing on [ORGANIZATION] is the part related to housing development, affordable housing development, and economic development, community economic development. And the overview of the pieces of the plan or the actions that are included in the plan is shown on this slide, on the housing side of the strategy slide.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"The overall point is to get more and to get better affordable housing in the corridor. And as [ORGANIZATION] pointed out, when we did the displacement or gentrification risk analysis [ORGANIZATION] as part of the comprehensive plan,  The south side of [ORGANIZATION] and all of [PERSON] popped out as a high-risk area given the characteristic income and the renters and the other characteristics of the households there. So even before there was a high-capacity transit project, we knew that this was a part of the city where we needed to pay attention to that issue.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"The 300 number is not necessarily reflected of the overall need of affordable housing in the city or in this corridor. However, part of what we needed to do is to  make this in proportion to the size of the transit project and the sense that we have of what the impact would be. We thought that was a more reasonable [STREET] to sort of set this particular goal.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"So you know the apartment buildings, especially that you see out east in [ORGANIZATION] on some of the lots, and their design need to be improved to benefit the households who live in those units more, and we're moving to evaluate and improve those standards. So overall, great. We hope that the multi-dwelling, the apartment buildings out in [ORGANIZATION] and elsewhere in the city will be better designed and will carry over into the affordable housing units as well, market rate and affordable.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"This  This corridor includes two of those eight, [ORGANIZATION], which is helpful. But moreover, it is large enough that we think we can find opportunities within this area in [ORGANIZATION] to [STREET] 300 affordable housing units in the area. We don't budget specifically by allocating resources because it is so driven by opportunities.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"Is your goal to have 300,000  New units of affordable housing, or is preservation part of your strategy? Well, this plan calls for 300 new units. We plan on, in addition, stabilizing the current stock to the greatest extent possible.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"The site that we've been talking about is particularly a site that will be where the  Bus rapid transit intersects or at least comes in the vicinity of the white rail, so it's a major sort of transfer point, so we think it's an opportune site for affordable housing. You're targeting it. My final question is, does that displace any other affordable housing commitments or priorities that the district had previously put on the table that we're now shifting to this focus?",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"We can get federal match for the transit component of this project. The federal government is not offering any match for the community mitigation pieces, so it makes it a little tougher for us to come up with the resources, but our commission felt that it was important that we do the mitigation, we commit to do the mitigation. We would also feel better if the affordable housing component of this mitigation plan was stronger than 300 units.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"We appreciate the effort to get to 300 units, but we think the real impact is probably somewhat larger. And finally, we think that there are additional strategies you'd probably be adding to the toolkit. I think we heard one of them [ORGANIZATION], which is land banking in advance of the transit project, because, of course, as soon as the transit project appears to be certain, the public benefit of that transit project will wind up being reflected in the property values and we'll pay more to get the land for the affordable housing and the other needs that we have.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,So I was –  hardened here that [ORGANIZATION] was talking about acquiring property now before that value is fully baked in. We think that's an important strategy. We also feel like affordable housing retention in the corridor is an important strategy.,portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"There's a number of organizations that have been really involved in digging into some of the tough questions that the council has been asking here around community stabilization and, of course, affordable housing production and preservation. Okay. So I think that, you know, overall the action plan, I do want to commend the staff that have been working on it for lifting up a lot of what we put in this toolkit, both from the legal tools that we have available to us and other some ideas that we haven't tried innovating yet.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"You know, they're really excited about the project because it brings more access to opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] students. Thank you. and finally across the [STREET] on the southwest corner, we have jams for FAC0, a [ORGANIZATION] project and a future site for affordable housing.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"We're intending to have 48 units of affordable housing there, which would be a great win for the community. That's a microcosm of the impact of this project on our neighbors and residents. You know, kind of going from that [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION] with [ORGANIZATION], our board voted to support the FAC0 project contingent on the funding for the mitigation strategies that were being proposed.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"There's a whole suite of priorities there that are all great, but for us, really four rise to the top. The first is more affordable housing. 300 units is a great start.",portland
07_27_2016,housing crisis,"I believe that this plan is the result of collaborative work between city [ORGANIZATION], all city [ORGANIZATION], community ORG1, ORG2, and ORG3ORG4ORG5. It provides muchORG4needed community stability actions to a transit project that can jeopardize a tenuous housing crisis in an already vulnerable community. I'm happy to see the business and technical assistance and workforce development tools addressed.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] found them so beneficial, it has established a threshold by which any public project that meets the criteria automatically triggers a [ORGANIZATION], and I encourage the city of [PERSON] to adopt a similar model. I also wanted to just quickly address to you, Commissioner [PERSON], I love your idea about creating some type of model for mobile home parks as an affordable housing. And I encourage you to visit FAC0 at FAC1 and FAC2.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"Sorry, I am concerned about the affordable housing because according to the chart on page 28, most of it is in [ORGANIZATION]. It's not along the corridor. There's $500,000 for outside of [ORGANIZATION] and $5.5 million within [ORGANIZATION].",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"A big part of how we're thinking about [ORGANIZATION] of the affordable housing piece of this is a share of the new resources that are just coming forward now, as well as programs that even since we started this planning project, housing's been able to secure through different sources and been able to identify how they can target someone on the corridor. It's a DATE1 plan. One of the things that we thought was really critical was to give [ORGANIZATION] a sense of  the order of magnitude of cost of lift it is to even attempt to meet some objectives like this, both on the housing and the economic development side, and to fairly represent to city council sort of what we had in hand [PERSON] and then what we need to continue to work on through one means or another to secure to be able to follow through on this scale of effort.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"PERSON0? Well, thank you to our [ORGANIZATION] and to everybody else who's participated in this [ORGANIZATION] – I'm sorry, [ORGANIZATION] –  I think it's a good plan, good questions about affordable housing, land use, and how we do this with buses quickly. And it's definitely a corridor in need of a lot of attention.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. And granted, 300 units is not enough, but I mean, I think that [ORGANIZATION] we probably would have said, well, maybe we are going to ask [ORGANIZATION] to stop because we don't know how we're going to get money for any significant investment in housing. One thing I want to note is that we also have heard from folks in the community that in addition to investment in affordable housing, they'd like to see stronger tenant protections.",portland
07_27_2016,affordable housing,"We're going to have to think very carefully when we do have the locally preferred alternative, how do we get all of the other jurisdictions to pay their fair share and to make sure that collectively we can fund it? Because that's, as we know with affordable housing, it's a metro-wide project problem and challenge, and yet a lot of the burden falls on [ORGANIZATION]'s taxpayers. So, yeah.",portland
07_25_2018,homeless,"So [ORGANIZATION], I wanted to look in your eyes and see the people intent on murdering me, my family, and the multitude of other homeless and transient people by legislating them into a constant status of prey for your predatory police. All we want is the right to exist without fear of abuse. When the government is the abuser, who is the mandatory reporter?",portland
07_25_2018,homeless,"If your position of preying on the homeless is just and moral, then you should have no problem killing me right here, right now. I'm here in courage. Are you going to join me or are you going to remain in fear as the coward you are?",portland
07_25_2018,homeless,"Next item, 802.  amend [ORGANIZATION] with [LOCATION] to authorize [ORGANIZATION] budget allocation to the [ORGANIZATION]. This item was also continued. Please call the roll.",portland
07_25_2018,affordable housing,"Aye. The ordinance is adopted. Item 803.  authorize 11 sub-recipient contracts totaling $4,190,763 for services in support of providing affordable housing.",portland
08_26_2015,homeless,But I signed up to talk on the state of the city so that I could speak about pretty much anything I wanted to. That was after my friend [ORGANIZATION] hosted a sleepover in front of FAC0 because the police were doing more sweeps on the homeless. I'm sure you're familiar with the situation.,portland
08_26_2015,homeless,"All you have to do is change the wording of the statute, but that seems to be rather impossible. Anyway, the city is in peril. The homeless people can't seem to get a break and spend [ORGANIZATION] of action and testifying.",portland
08_26_2015,homeless,"Thank you. 873. Item 873, a request of [ORGANIZATION] to address counsel regarding homeless issues.",portland
08_26_2015,homeless,"874, a request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless issues. Good morning. Good morning.",portland
08_26_2015,houseless,"I'm [PERSON], for the record. I stay at [ORGANIZATION] myself on FAC0. The line between housing and house, the housed and houseless is very thin.",portland
08_26_2015,affordable housing,How will we provide for those people and if we are not able to provide enough affordable housing for Portlanders DATE0? Although the city has the power to change this story with development happening citywide. [ORGANIZATION] strongly supports all the anti-displacement measures that are added to the comprehensive plan by [ORGANIZATION].,portland
08_26_2015,houseless,"A critical policy was added to the [ORGANIZATION] plan says that the city must adequately involve communities that could be adversely affected by planning and development decisions. This means that the houseless community will have a stronger voice  Guiding how our city grows and develops with equity and inclusion is our ultimate goal. As part of a strong and growing group of 30 [ORGANIZATION] organizations, we are counting on [ORGANIZATION] to keep all these important anti-displacement measures in the final plan.",portland
08_26_2015,houseless,"875, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding houseless issues. PERSON1, you're here. All right, we'll have to give him [ORGANIZATION], and then [LOCATION].",portland
08_26_2015,homeless,"876, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless issues. Ms. [PERSON], are you here? Is she here?",portland
08_26_2015,homelessness,"So that's up to us. And I – That's a distinction probably lost on most people in the public where it says we're going to implement the recommendations and they have a budget cast. I mean, I was thinking, as I was thinking about your resolution, of preparing a resolution that accepts a report on homelessness and sets the council directive that we reduce it by 50%.",portland
08_26_2015,homeless,"The result raised to the bottom with no one making a reasonable income in the fallout of our industry to most dedicated drivers. If the drivers are no longer able to earn an income, their option for family survival will be extremely limited. Drivers and their family could quickly become homeless and consequently depend upon welfare.",portland
07_29_2015,affordable housing,"But experience in our sister cities on [ORGANIZATION] shows that the market, as currently shaped and structured, cannot assure the broad supply of housing available to families of modest means and even middle incomes we need. Of course, we should do what we can to build new affordable housing. But even if we are far more successful than we have been in the past, permanently affordable housing will never supply more than 3 or 4 percent of our housing stock.",portland
08_02_2017,homeless,"There's no dispute about the goal here. But I am concerned about us setting expectations. And as you know, coming out of our most recent budget, you know, we're still scrambling to find money to fill potholes, to provide services for homeless people, to do a whole host of things.",portland
08_02_2017,affordable housing,"But at some point, just as we stepped into the housing fray ahead of the state in order to put leverage on the state and in order to take care of the situation in our community,  [ORGANIZATION] quality seems every bit as important to me as affordable housing, and so I'd use exactly the parallel argument we use to pass a relocation ordinance. Well, let me just close by saying that the context for this discussion is –  a shared sense of frustration on this council agreed that on issues we care about we often find ourselves preempted by the state legislature abandoned by the federal government overturned by [ORGANIZATION] and and unclear about how we go forward so this is the context and i i applaud mayor your your um sense of righteous indignation about how we approach this problem  I guess I go back to what I said earlier, which is since we are investigating other regional authorities, since we are talking about a possible regional approach, I think bringing the council along early on in terms of potential frameworks and what this might look like is useful.",portland
08_02_2017,homeless,"The organization has been operating with great success for [ORGANIZATION] out of [ORGANIZATION], and with this new school has now expanded to the east side in [ORGANIZATION], largely in response to the shifting demographics of the region. DATE1 I also worked on a project with [ORGANIZATION], transition projects, [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2. We transformed a building.  warehouse on southeast [PERSON] into [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION].",portland
08_02_2017,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], your company, which you're a co-founder of, commits a portion of your proceeds to benefit [PERSON], an organization that we're all very familiar with and very happy with. It's a local organization that mentors homeless and transitional youth. So you seem to have both head and heart.",portland
08_02_2017,homelessness,"Second is how do we bring art and culture into the urban renewal conversation? And, you know, artists and artist affordability and those issues, they are never going to be as important as the acute crisis of homelessness, the affordability challenge generally faced by renters and others. We understand that.",portland
08_02_2017,affordable housing,"I think as you approach the FAC0 blocks, there's a huge opportunity to think about art and makers in those. And the third question, and I guess this is mostly for [ORGANIZATION], we do know that we're going to have fewer resources for affordable housing. Now, [ORGANIZATION] is not the lead anymore.",portland
08_02_2017,homeless,"And I'll be watching you as a watchdog very close. One of my issues or one of my points I wanted to bring up, again, on the housing, the most vulnerable people in our city, the homeless, people that live below the poverty line. I'm hoping that, again, [ORGANIZATION] will begin to look at following what [ORGANIZATION] just did, passing ORG1 [PERSON], to begin a process on looking at the universal basic income for all through [PERSON].",portland
08_02_2017,homeless,"Nobody to be excluded. And that means universal basic income will be paying [ORGANIZATION] $12,000 to $15,000 a year, as well as that person on the sidewalk. So again...  In my limited time here during public communication, when we're talking about the homeless, the most vulnerable, start focusing on that, at least take a look at it, and start having communication with people about it to have a better understanding.",portland
08_02_2017,homeless,"Thank you. And I can't campaign for you, Mayor [PERSON]. I met you at your opening announcement, and I said my issues were protecting our water, homeless, and no demolition.",portland
08_02_2017,homelessness,The hybrid also made sense if we could save money by slowly converting from the UV to filtration but I'm at the point where filtration makes the most sense to me because it actually will solve problems that are very likely to come in the future and like I said I'm  really concerned about low income rate payers. I am going to be working on stemming the tide of cost burdening and displacement and homelessness the whole time I'm here. So keeping people in their existing housing is very important to me and I think to the whole city.,portland
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"Item 463. I'm in planning and zoning code, the comprehensive plan map, and the zoning map to implement the expanding opportunities for affordable housing project. Well, colleagues, this is the second reading.",portland
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"When I first raised concerns about the project not requiring affordability, it seemed like that ship had sailed and there was nothing we could do about it. So I want to thank everyone who helped us  make the expanding opportunities for affordable housing project actually require affordability. Work isn't done.",portland
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"Congratulations on your retirement at [ORGANIZATION]. You will be missed. And finally, I want to thank my colleagues for your support as we've worked quickly to strengthen this project while avoiding delays for projects that have been waiting to build affordable housing.",portland
06_17_2020,affordable housing,Roots. This is a project that so many people can be proud of. It's a true collective effort by community and safe space organizations to use their property more creatively and flexibly for needed housing and now affordable housing.,portland
06_17_2020,houseless,"And that affects us. tax payments and obedience to laws and whether you have protests, etc. Have them require to show you the pattern and history, for example, of the cop recklessly speeding or tailgating or crowding and show the, show whether the victims within that targeted hate groups like queer, trans, black, indigenous  [ORGANIZATION], houseless, or someone stuck in fear or pain that we call mental illness, and what neighborhoods these seem to repeatedly happen in.

06_17_2020,affordable housing,"And does this amendment apply only to middle housing or is it all new development, including expensive new development? So this change in code allows the type of developments that are anticipated under the [ORGANIZATION] to be developed by paying an LTIC charge. So there are in our administrative rules exemptions and those cover affordable housing developments and ADUs.",portland
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"But essentially, there's not a threshold other than affordable housing for who would get an exemption. Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. So this is PERSON1 with [ORGANIZATION] Manager for [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"And it doesn't differentiate based on the type of housing, so a duplex, triplex, or a luxury single family home, except for as [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, there are waivers for affordable housing projects. Thank you. And then where can the LTIC money be used?",portland
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"And here's my question. What do you mean when you say affordable housing? Oh yeah, my bad.",portland
06_17_2020,affordable housing,"We need moderately priced and affordable housing and the rational [STREET] improvements that come with the LTIC. We urge you to adopt this amendment. Thank you, [ORGANIZATION].",portland

06_28_2017,homeless,Can I go on for... Good. I could be helpful there in telling you how to address the homeless issue.,portland
06_28_2017,affordable housing,I think it would be very odd if the cities in the business of acquiring properties preserve affordable housing than displacing people. So can you give us an update on that? Sure.,portland
09_06_2017,homeless,"I do approve of the appointments and the reappointments of all individuals here. I think your qualifications are very good and essential for [ORGANIZATION]. One of the concerns I have, though, with your organization is that I myself would like to see more of the artists tapped out in the community, in the homeless community.",portland
09_06_2017,homeless,"I want to see more art on the walls created by the homeless, such as, you know, [ORGANIZATION] went into [ORGANIZATION] and painted the doors. This has been very beneficial. It brings...  a light into situations that is very positive.",portland
09_06_2017,homeless,"Art lifts the spirits of people, and I want to see the homeless community involved more to whatever degree, any direction they go, but have that opportunity to look at different things and different ways of doing things and different enjoyment that you can get from art.

09_06_2017,homeless,"And those are lasting things that you can purchase through people and remember them.

09_06_2017,homeless,Reach out to the homeless community and offer more to them. They are in the most need of great art and the ability to make art. Thank you.,portland
09_06_2017,homeless,"and people who have limited English proficiency, low income or underrepresented communities. Our community advisory group represented many groups that are listed here.

06_27_2018,houseless,"And then the fourth is equally important. One of the things that we aspire to is that through the interaction of our volunteers who are housed and as they come to know and understand that many of the houseless folks are just like them but for different circumstances, that there will come to be a mutual understanding and respect.  and slowly and organically that this can maybe spread out in our community. Thank you for the opportunity to speak.",portland
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"Appreciate it. 746, please. Authorized purchase of certain real property located at [ADDRESS] at a price and closing costs not to exceed $558,000 to develop new affordable housing.",portland
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"So, colleagues, this is yet another property associated with [ORGANIZATION]. The housing bond promised 1,300 units of permanently affordable housing, and it promised that that would be created within a five- to [DATE] timeframe of passage. In [ORGANIZATION], we have approximately half of the promised units either already purchased or in process in both new developments and acquisitions of existing buildings.",portland
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"This acquisition represents the fourth project identified under the housing bond. [ORGANIZATION] is excited to bring this ordinance before the council DATE0 as another step towards meeting the goals of the housing bond. The acquisition of this property will create 50 to 75 new units of affordable housing in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, a neighborhood on the front lines of gentrification and displacement.",portland
07_18_2018,homeless,"Future development of this property will create additional family-sized units for households earning 0% to 30% [ORGANIZATION], as well as providing more supportive housing units to the city in coordination with [ORGANIZATION]. And just colloquially, 0% to 30%, that is housing with support services for the people we are seeing on the streets, people who are chronically homeless, people who are in crisis. This not only allows them access to housing that they can afford and be successful in, it will also provide opportunities for services.",portland
07_18_2018,homelessness,"Under the housing bond, we are seeking to create new housing and well as prevent displacement. That's why we're both investing in properties for new development as well as acquiring existing buildings. We are prioritizing communities of color, families and households facing homelessness or displacement.",portland
07_18_2018,homelessness,"It's a wise long-term investment. And we know that it's going to be supporting the folks that are experiencing homelessness and families that are really vulnerable to displacement. So with that, I think it's an excellent investment.",portland
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"And so I thought that was an important connection to make here between folks who are involved in grassroots affordable housing advocacy on the ground who themselves are facing a crisis in their own housing, and this bond has directly supported them in finding permanent, stable, affordable homes. But that does lead me to note that the bond and all of the acquisitions that are being made with it are, as I know you have all noted, are one piece of the affordable housing puzzle in [ORGANIZATION]. And so building on this momentum in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, we're excited that the manufactured housing park zoning proposal is coming to council very soon, which will –  prevent the displacement of over 3,000 households in this city, which is more than twice as many as will be served by the bond itself.",portland
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"And then...  The last piece that I wanted to mention for the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood is our ongoing work led by [ORGANIZATION] to develop affordable housing on the former FAC0 property that Living [ORGANIZATION] was able to acquire in [ORGANIZATION]. So this bond acquisition is very exciting news for our neighborhood, and we are very eager to work with  and with ORG2 to keep that momentum rolling into the next steps for preserving affordable housing, building new affordable housing, and preventing displacement in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood and across the city. Thank you.",portland
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you. So it is because of that we do encourage the development of permanently affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], and we're delighted to learn of this new development that will join the more than 300 units of affordable housing owned by [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], the many more development units that will be developed on the property formerly known as [ORGANIZATION],  the 59 units that's being built by a local developer in conjunction with ORG2 and ORG3 on FAC1. This is very exciting for us and one thing we'd like to make sure of is that these affordable units do benefit people who in [ORGANIZATION] who are at risk of displacement  first and foremost, and we hope that [LOCATION] can find a [STREET] to reach out to folks like the residents of the [ORGANIZATION] apartments who are being displaced by economic forces, and we don't want to lose those folks from our neighborhood.",portland
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"All the active groups in [ORGANIZATION], including [ORGANIZATION], for identifying yet another site to develop affordable housing for our residents. It sounds like a great piece of property, and I'm sure it will be a great thing we put on that property, too. Aye.",portland
07_18_2018,homeless,"Will you sanction a homeless camp? Next individual, please. Next individual, please.",portland
07_18_2018,homeless,We're going to start a homeless camp. Excuse me. This is in violation of council rules.,portland
07_18_2018,homeless,"Obviously, that's the president of the union representing the police when facing facts that  Unfortunately, your administration didn't discover on its own. We had to rely on the Oregonian? We had to rely on the freaking Oregonian to tell us that over half the people processed by [ORGANIZATION] police are homeless.",portland
07_18_2018,homeless,"And as of yet, we know that the independent police review is doing an investigation that will...  go on while probably hundreds of other homeless people are pointlessly processed through the jail. And I hope that when the brilliant leadership that [ORGANIZATION] gives [ORGANIZATION] is fully processed with this investigation, we'll see that  It probably wasn't the best idea to throw another million dollars at them just because Permit [PERSON] is concerned about the 911 response time when she calls to complain about black people having a barbecue. So please, you know, there are people that engage with the community well in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
07_18_2018,affordable housing,"I have been heavily involved in the design of large scale mixed use projects in downtown [ORGANIZATION] and the project that was mentioned is a potential development of a 35 story tower which has three components, an office component, a hotel component and a mixed use or a residential component. The [STREET] the ordinance is currently written right now, we would actually have to pay for a fee in lieu of almost $29 million to offset just 28 affordable housing units, which would frankly kill the project. I think it's fair to have this payment be attributable only to the residential units.",portland
07_18_2018,homeless,"742, request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding homeless issues.  Is Ms. [PERSON] here [ORGANIZATION]? I don't see her. Have any items been pulled from the consent agenda, [ORGANIZATION]?",portland
08_24_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Thanks for being here [ORGANIZATION]. Next item, please. 9.43, authorize construction and permanent financing in an amount not to exceed $5,766,[ADDRESS] to facilitate the affordable redevelopment project known as [ORGANIZATION].  Colleagues, as a city, we're responding to the urgency of the housing crisis with unprecedented affordable housing production. In [LOCATION], we've worked to triple our pipeline of affordable housing units, now with 2,200 units currently under development.",portland
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"One of these 72 fosters is expected to break ground in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood [ORGANIZATION]. It's an innovative project that leverages the combined strengths of three valued nonprofit partners, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2, to create culturally responsive affordable housing that will serve a diverse mix of households and help prevent the displacement of minority communities here in [ORGANIZATION]. Conceived as an intergenerational mixed-use development, [ORGANIZATION] will provide more than 100 units for low-income households within the most concentrated Asian American population in the entire state of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"We're developing this, and they're going to be the resident service providers you heard in the building. So again, this is kind of a dream come true for both organizations that we're able to make this happen in the [ORGANIZATION] area. I think it also is worth saying that [ORGANIZATION] has helped us better understand the ways in which cultural communities work.  may sometimes feel shut out of traditional affordable housing, especially if we don't take into account different languages, traditions, or a sense of mistrust that sometimes people have with institutions.",portland
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] gave the background of how much we'd worked and how long we worked with [ORGANIZATION] on this vision. And in the time of the [ORGANIZATION] election, federal tax credits are the main [STREET] that we finance affordable housing nationwide. And right after the election, this project, as every other project in the nation, faced a budget shortage.",portland
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"So that is all on reach. We take all the risk to do that, to allow the affordable housing financing partners in the project to know that their portion of the project is protected. So that gives us more flexibility to work with our community partners, but also with leasing agents to try to meet that vision that both [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] talked about, to lease it the [STREET] in which we want.",portland
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"But you've got now a resource that's a great community resource. And I think the larger question is, how does [ORGANIZATION], ORG1 going forward in the city, help you be successful in really leveraging that space? Because that space there and another nonprofit affordable housing development throughout the city I think increasingly is going to become a more valuable asset.",portland
08_24_2017,homelessness,"But we do have, like you pointed out, the subsidized units. So it's affordable to people with very low income or zero income potentially. So it will be open and available to potentially people coming out of homelessness.",portland
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"With [ORGANIZATION], this will be the first time that they have been providing resident services in an affordable housing building like this. So it's a new partnership. So the other thing we're going to be doing here is learning.",portland
08_24_2017,homelessness,"And so I think we're also being cautious about how many formal commitments we make on the service side up front. But clearly, they would tell you.  very clearly that homelessness in the Asian communities they serve is often visible. They're not always counted.",portland
08_24_2017,homeless,"They're often staying with people in circumstances that are not being – that aren't visible. And so they see this as a huge opportunity to provide housing and services to people that are extremely vulnerable and homeless. So –  I believe that the partnership we have with them is going to serve the intent of the commitment to permanent supportive housing, even though you don't see that here as a formal agreement per se.",portland
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"I believe, and I may be wrong, but I believe this land was purchased when [ORGANIZATION] was mayor. and it was long before people really thought that foster, this section of foster, was going to be a focal point of our affordable housing strategy. But a little PDC money and a little housing money went, I believe, to purchase the property, which was not in great condition.",portland
08_24_2017,affordable housing,"to getting affordable housing stock into the community. And even with the financial resources ready and available, it still has taken [ORGANIZATION] to get to this point. So it's a good illustration that we have the right players, we have the right funding resources, we have the right visions, but none of this comes easily and none of it comes quickly.",portland
08_24_2017,houseless,"There are no organizations of houseless persons on that list,  or even advocates. Next, the desired effect of the [ORGANIZATION] making informed recommendations will be better served by requiring meetings with members of the bodies now outlined in Deliverable No. 7 as optional. [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], as [ORGANIZATION],  [ORGANIZATION] is required in the new document to meet with ORG6, ORG7, and the new [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_22_2017,affordable housing,"We do have duplexes in our neighborhood under the current infill that is allowed on corner lots, and those have worked out well. But moving to higher density, I think, is beyond the scope of our testimony [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, I know you haven't had that discussion, and as you know, you can't put a duplex on a corner, so since they're creating several corners, that might be a [STREET] to have still single-family homes that are  on their own lot perhaps even, that would be less expensive because we had several of the neighbors concerned about affordable housing and also potentially have less impact on the resource.",portland
08_03_2017,homelessness,"But then immediately seeing the homelessness here, knowing some of those people there are veterans as well. And then also seeing this environment that's related directly to this issue is actually fomenting the circumstances for extremism. and why that can't be resolved, why you can't find a [STREET] to actually meaningfully interact with the community in such a [STREET] that they are actually dictating, not dictating in terms, but setting the agenda for how they can actually protect themselves.",portland
08_03_2017,homeless,"They see all the homeless people on the [STREET], and they wonder, why are the elected officials not listening to the people? Where's the actual governance on behalf of the people? Not just a bunch of public testimony, but where is the true oversight of our city, the governing of our city, according to the will of the people?",portland
08_03_2017,houseless,"Okay. And [ORGANIZATION]'s rules are very dear to my heart. In [ORGANIZATION] I received a notice on [ORGANIZATION] letterhead and as a tenant I thought that that was an eviction notice because as a tenant, as a renter, I live with that fear every day due to [ORGANIZATION]'s inadequate laws for the houseless population and the renter class, although we have made strides with relocation assistance which I'm really looking forward to talking to the commissioners about [LOCATION].",portland
08_03_2017,affordable housing,"Affordable housing is the next one at [DATE], and then the [ORGANIZATION] appointments. I've got an idea, and I'll probably not endure myself with my colleagues, but we have precedent for this. Mayor, why don't we schedule this at a time certain on either [ORGANIZATION] or DATE1 at [TIME]?",portland
09_04_2019,homeless,"Priorities and then general fund resources have been really important contributors to the district livability. priorities for the community and [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION] as well as PERSON1 with ORG1 are here and can speak to those priorities a bit further. So, again, just kind of a recap.",portland
09_04_2019,affordable housing,Three out of four units of housing in the area is long-term stabilized affordable housing. And so a mix of income units has long been a desired outcome for the community. We're happy to say we reached 260 of those 500 new moderate income units and some of that was thanks to a pilot SDC deduction that we're actually not asking for as part of this extension because we feel as though both the market as well as inclusionary housing can continue to deliver on that mixed income.,portland
09_04_2019,homeless,"Good morning. Good morning, Mayor and Commissioners. I'm [PERSON] and I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
09_04_2019,homeless,"I'll probably touch on a number of points that [ORGANIZATION] just also spoke to in terms of the task force. But it will give you a little more historic context for some of the recommendations that we made and that I think are also advanced through the extension or the proposed extension of the [ORGANIZATION] plan. So for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] supported the work of a task force that started out as just [ORGANIZATION], but later expanded to include [PERSON].",portland
09_04_2019,homelessness,"The task force, as [ORGANIZATION] said, first came together in response to the plan to site a new shelter for people experiencing homelessness on FAC0. From the beginning, the charge of the task force was more than just planning for the new shelter. The city and the county through the joint office committed as part of the discussion about the shelter to work with local community stakeholders.",portland
09_04_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"With input from a wide range of stakeholders, including businesses and homeowners, affordable housing tenants, social service providers, people with lived experience, and a variety of government entities from the city and county, [ORGANIZATION] first developed a good neighbor agreement for the navigation center, which as you likely know, opened and welcomed its first guests [ORGANIZATION]. It will ultimately have 100 people staying at it at any given time working on transitioning out of homelessness and back into housing. Once that good neighbor agreement was complete, we developed a set of recommendations to improve social service delivery in the neighborhoods.",portland
09_04_2019,homelessness,We then used a similar process of convening practitioners and stakeholders to develop a comprehensive list of some 25 recommendations related to improving the sense of safety for everyone in the neighborhoods. These recommendations included everything from foot patrols to activating public spaces to improving training for private security to improving the responsiveness of law enforcement to the safety needs of people experiencing homelessness. And to expanding criminal justice diversion programs.,portland
09_04_2019,homeless,"And, of course, the homeless services is all general fund. It's 100% at this point. Well, which is, again, my concern of us making commitments of general fund resources so early on.",portland
09_04_2019,homeless,"The city aroused people that camped there. I have to say this, and I don't want to turn on homeless people, but I do not believe people should be able to, or should camp out or camp at the [INSTITUTION], anywhere near the [INSTITUTION]. Okay?",portland
09_04_2019,homeless,"And I could be accused of turning on homeless people if you're going to camp. Nowhere else but that [STREET]. If you want to keep it look like a Swiss [INSTITUTION], you've got to solve that problem.",portland
09_04_2019,homeless,"And I may turn on homeless people camped out at the [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] because they're going to get rousted [ORGANIZATION] anyway. So, which makes me look at it elitist, like I'm living in [ORGANIZATION], I'm over [LOCATION], I'm under [PERSON], I'm on food stamps, like I'm an honored [ORGANIZATION] citizen. But that's the [STREET] it is.",portland
09_04_2019,affordable housing,"It's not as they say to me as they pat my head, it's really middle class housing or medium income housing or middle income housing or one of the five to ten terms used to really not address who is it that you're putting that sign out. Who is included in not being able to participate in market rate housing in this attachment, of the matter is in [ORGANIZATION] they've done great work at bringing affordable housing and market rate housing into balance and now they're going to kick it all the [STREET] out and so there's pie charts",portland
09_04_2019,houseless,But I think I'm comfortable in knowing that there's a vision that's working very cooperatively with the neighborhood. I do have some concerns about... what clean and safe will look like in this new extension how are we decriminalizing a lot of transient houseless people who live in that area and how we can be less reliant on law enforcement responses to people who quite frankly are ill or have nowhere else to go. It is heartbreaking to see the people that hang out in [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] with no access to resources and so I hope this helps to build or revitalize businesses in [ORGANIZATION] as well as take a humane approach to the people who are trying to survive on the streets outside of [ORGANIZATION] as well.,portland
09_04_2019,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], who is here to give a presentation on the homeless services. Many, many people came together from [ORGANIZATION] to help shape this extension. It's comprehensive, it focuses on neighborhood investment.",portland
09_04_2019,affordable housing,"So the garage is co-owned between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], and there will be a third, we own the air rights [ORGANIZATION], there could be a third-party ownership for the air rights. And to the question about why not include residential, is it zoning, is it um it's actually we've prioritized it around office given the access to access to transit and that [ORGANIZATION] district is a really important job center and that tends to be how we kind of promote our properties first and foremost for jobs And as was mentioned, I think ORG2 doesn't have a significant amount of remaining resources. And so most often when we're partnering on housing projects, we're partnering with ORG3 around mixed income and or affordable housing.",portland
09_04_2019,affordable housing,"I don't think housing would be a top priority, but I agree that if you're selling the air rights, And if you're going to sell the air rights, then it should be up to the person doing the development, unless we have clear criteria for who should be invited to apply, especially if they're making sure that we have permanently affordable housing for small business space for small businesses. we are not investing in small businesses at all in a [STREET] that's going to help them thrive over the long haul and so I'm just concerned we keep making the advantages for the big ones but the small ones are still suffering. I want to make sure that we are also selling the design products so we could certainly list it as the air rights for kind of any use and then the air rights plus the design product for office use.",portland
09_04_2019,affordable housing,"But we had testimony about the affordable housing development on FAC0. Again, in [ORGANIZATION] when that property was in the portfolio of [ORGANIZATION], it was slated to be a luxury hotel. Yes.",portland
09_04_2019,affordable housing,"And when it transferred to the new [ORGANIZATION] and then was subject to the guidelines of affordable housing, we ended up with the vision that we currently have, which is affordable housing there on a fantastic location. So I couldn't be prouder of that. So thank you very much.",portland
09_04_2019,homeless; affordable housing,"I think it's worth highlighting, though, because it does look bad to the public when we're spending $1.5 million on something that seems relatively frivolous compared to some of the more urgent issues we're facing. But what they often don't know is that these... are earmarked for very specific things. And for instance, we absolutely could not take this $1.5 million and spend it on affordable housing or homeless services.",portland
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"So with that, please read the item and we'll turn to my colleague, Commissioner [PERSON]. Refer a measure to the city voters for the [ORGANIZATION] general election authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds in the amount of $258,400,000 to provide funding for affordable housing. Commissioner [PERSON].",portland
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor and colleagues. People who have grown up in [ORGANIZATION] and want to raise their families here are not able to because of escalating rents and low vacancies.

06_30_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"Workers who contribute day in and day out to our city's economic vibrancy cannot afford to live in the city in which they work. As I've said before, the lack of affordable housing is the greatest crisis now facing our city. It's a crisis with a very human toll, and it will take all of us working together together  to make a real dent in solving this crisis the council over [ORGANIZATION] first looked to our existing resources and as mayor [ORGANIZATION] has said we dug deep we in we increased the urban renewal funds dedicated to affordable housing by 50 we dedicated short-term rental talk rental tax revenues to the effort and we committed 10 million dollars DATE1 which starts DATE2  to help more folks find move from homelessness into housing next we looked at a means to ensure that the new growth that new growth would pay for its effect on the need for affordable housing and [ORGANIZATION] i'm proud to say this council unanimously established a commercial excise tax on new development and it dedicated 100 of that excise tax to creating more affordable housing",portland
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"so we dug deep in the city's budget we've asked development to pay  for its impact on the need for affordable housing, and now we're asking [ORGANIZATION] voters to step up to the plate by supporting a bond for affordable housing. This bond is specifically targeted toward achieving deeply affordable housing for households making less than 30% of median family income. Those are seniors on fixed incomes, families with a disabled parent, and workers who earn minimum wage.",portland
06_30_2016,homelessness,and then we have uh two invited panels okay great good [TIME] mayor [ORGANIZATION] members of [ORGANIZATION] uh with me is [PERSON] who's going to be writing a powerpoint so i don't get distracted from from my uh verbal remarks  This is the last major fiscal building block in [ORGANIZATION]'s response to the state of emergency for homelessness and housing.,portland
06_30_2016,homeless,You previously took steps to increase the general fund allocation. including money for [ORGANIZATION] for voucher utilization and for the full funding of ORG1. You previously took action to allocate and appropriate additional monies for the tax increment financing lift.  which will have profound effects throughout the city and the open urban renewal areas.,portland
06_30_2016,homeless,"And then last, but certainly not least, we'll be working diligently with [ORGANIZATION] to implement [PERSON], this being [ORGANIZATION] that our office is responsible. DATE1, of course, the staff will migrate to [ORGANIZATION] office. So we'll be very busy over DATE2.",portland
06_30_2016,affordable housing,You've given us the tools we need to succeed. And I'd like [ORGANIZATION] to be known as [ORGANIZATION] of hope as we deal with the problems that we have throughout the city to work with renters who are in desperate need of assistance and to try to backfill voids in our housing delivery system with permanently affordable housing. What you do [ORGANIZATION] will have lasting benefits for [ORGANIZATION].,portland
06_30_2016,homeless,"On the far left, the shelter budget you see is serving some 5,000 people.  about $15 million a year with homeless prevention, keeping people in their homes through short-term rental assistance and other interventions, serving about 5,800 people, housing placement and retention,  some $15 million of general fund and federal funds, serving some 4,300 people. Supportive housing and services at [TIME] on the dial is serving some 3,000 households with about $9 million of general fund and federal funds. And then we have the capital cost, if you will, of regulated affordable rental housing, showing the interplay of the construction excise tax monies that you approved [ORGANIZATION], the bond that you have before you [PERSON], and, of course, the baseline of tax increment.",portland
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"affordable housing in outlying jurisdictions, and some of them might be the places where the jobs are too. So if we were able to build in [ORGANIZATION], I'd like you to look into that possibility. And then my final question is, do we have a partnership agreement with the county so that there'll be some help in operating these units and providing services, especially in the [ORGANIZATION] range?",portland
06_30_2016,affordable housing,"And you have done a lot, but we're not done yet. We still have thousands of people in our community who don't earn enough to pay the exorbitant amounts that new apartments cost. And since our existing stock is full and rents are rising a double digit, that means if we want to help people move off the streets and into housing, if we want to help seniors who are living on fixed incomes, and we want to help families who are working but still struggling,  We need this bond because we need to build more affordable housing.",portland
06_30_2016,homeless,"DATE0, we were homeless, and we ended up nowhere to go. We slept in the car. My wife, [ORGANIZATION], she's not here right now.",portland
06_30_2016,homeless,"Then I met [ORGANIZATION], which helped us get out of our state. The reason why we were homeless is because basically our landlord had failed to tell us that his house was foreclosed on. And it was just a big shock.",portland
06_30_2016,affordable housing,Good luck to you. [ORGANIZATION] welcome thank you mayor [PERSON] commissioners my name is [ORGANIZATION] bonacore i'm the executive director of [ORGANIZATION] we administer the housing choice voucher program and a portfolio of public and affordable housing throughout [PERSON] the majority of our funding comes from [ORGANIZATION],portland

07_08_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you. or they pay into a housing investment fund for us to create that affordable housing. So these are all things that we're undertaking, but working with the faith community is really essential because we can't do it all, and the faith community has so much more resources in terms of people committed to these ideals, and the ideal of taking a family and helping a family, one family at a time, is really important.",portland
07_08_2015,homelessness,"So thank you. Hi.  Thank you very much, everybody, for taking the time to come [ORGANIZATION], but more importantly, taking the time to work within your faith communities to wrap around services for individuals and families. It is one person at a time in this challenge to help people prevent homelessness and get out of houselessness.",portland
07_08_2015,homelessness,"I first met [ORGANIZATION] through [PERSON] a number of [DATE] when [ORGANIZATION] had this idea of organizing the faith community to address homelessness. The truth was the faith community has always been in the front lines of addressing homelessness, but the idea was to coordinate and to leverage the great strengths of the faith community. So [ORGANIZATION], thank you for all your work and your service, and thanks to all of our faith leaders who are joining us [ORGANIZATION].",portland
07_08_2015,homelessness,"And I want to just acknowledge that I think what [ORGANIZATION] said [TIME] was one of the most eloquent statements anyone has said on this body about homelessness and about our convictions. And I thank [PERSON] for being a champion. In [ORGANIZATION], for people of faith, there have been some developments that are encouraging.",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"That is one of our lifelines to build affordable housing in our community. And to eliminate the home program because we can't afford to invest in people, but we can afford to invest in things like military hardware. Did someone say the word shame earlier?",portland
07_08_2015,housing crisis,"Collectively, we need to say that the federal government must support a national housing crisis. That means that anyone running for office at the federal level has to say they will commit to using federal resources, our tax dollars, to invest in housing because, after all, in a mobile society, it is a federal concern. We cannot possibly solve a national crisis locally any more than we can solve any other national crisis locally without a strong federal partner.",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"There is now clear studies that have come out in [ORGANIZATION] making the case that families in high-opportunity areas with low-income kids do better than families that are marginalized. Well, who is against opportunity? But the fact is Commissioner [PERSON] gets criticized for building affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] because people say, well, the dirt's more expensive there.",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"But unless we have a strong federal partner, unless we continue to successfully fight the good fight about who we serve and where we [STREET] people, where they live, unless we build more housing and preserve current affordable housing,  And unless we make a community-wide commitment to address addiction and mental health at a much higher level, we will not solve the problem. And it's no solace to know that we're doing a better job than [ORGANIZATION] and some other cities. There's no solace in that.",portland
07_08_2015,homeless,"and we should be ashamed that we have not made more progress than we have, but we'll make it through this kind of partnership and this kind of shared commitment. One I want to mention in particular, and actually a [STREET] I believe that your initiative can help us, is one of the things that we've committed to in this ORG0 effort, which [ORGANIZATION], who's here, we stole him away from direct service to homeless people at [ORGANIZATION] and asked him to be the staff person for the city and the county and ORG2 and the city of [ORGANIZATION] working together to try to be helpful. coherent among all those multiple governments in what we do in housing.",portland
07_08_2015,homeless,"And we've said we're going to take on one thing that, in addition to the rest of the commitments that we've made, where we can move the ball down the field just a little bit, and that is we're going to try to get all of our homeless veterans inside [ORGANIZATION]. It's a manageable number of people. We need to house [DATE].",portland
07_08_2015,homeless,"And I'm going to depart just a little bit to say that it's too bad when we were talking about  profit and responsible investing and the homeless situation that we didn't have more engagement from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG1 right here. Thank you. Thank you.",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"and I know that they've been distributed further beyond that original distribution as well. The three proposed amendments that you asked to be considered at this session, one was not discussed [ORGANIZATION]. This was an amendment that Commissioner [PERSON] recommended asking that we amend the section for the internal notification process to allow for bureaus to express an interest even if they don't have funding in hand right at that moment so that the commissioners in charge  reasonably agree to extend the period of time so that a bureau could propose something in [LOCATION] for consideration so that bureaus can express interest even if they don't have the money right there available at the moment  The second amendment is one that Commissioner [PERSON] raised [ORGANIZATION], which was amended slightly after discussion amongst the council offices, and this is to the external notification process to recommend...  Or to require that the city real property coordinator contact the neighborhood coalition office to let them know that their neighborhood association Affiliated with a property that has been deemed excess has not responded to the initial inquiry to try to prompt that neighborhood association to provide an official response to the notice of the property being available and  The third amendment, which is on the second page, is in response to Commissioner [PERSON]'s request to add language to say that whenever practicable, the [ORGANIZATION] and the Commissioner in charge shall consider proposing conditions for disposition of the real property for affordable housing, community, or open space use.",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"I'm not saying use properties that can be used for affordable housing, used for parks, used for uses that are very important to certain groups. I'm saying the infrastructure of this city has been neglected in the past. We have to make up that difference somehow, some [STREET], and I think the possibility to look in this direction is there, and I hope the council will consider that.",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"And thanks to Commissioner [PERSON] also for spearheading this effort as well. I'm pleased that we've clarified that there will be a subscription notification system for interested members of the public. And I also believe the amendment language [ORGANIZATION] regarding the consideration of disposition of properties for affordable housing, open space, and community use will allow the council to have the information it needs when it makes these decisions when property is declared surplus.",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"IF ANY OF THOSE BODIES FIND THIS IS NOT TRUE, [ORGANIZATION]. YOU STILL HAVE A MASTER PLAN OPTION DOWN THE [STREET]. Colleagues, I remind you that when we adopted the amendment to the urban renewal area, we had a pretty intensive discussion about affordable housing at this site.",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"And since we're trying to simplify things [ORGANIZATION], I just want to make sure I understand one of the points that you raise about affordable housing at [ORGANIZATION]. Now, [ORGANIZATION], would you correct me if I'm wrong, but...  part of that packet that parcel is a fire bureau property correct and i believe you've already either stated your intention or or we've taken some action to put a covenant on that property so that it will in fact be developed as affordable housing and then would therefore be subject to the set aside is that correct correct  I just want to make sure that we're clear on that.",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"And that's not the entire triangle, but it's at least been decided as to the [ORGANIZATION] portion of the triangle that, in fact, it will be prioritized for affordable housing. And I think I've said that in my – I didn't say that earlier, but I said that in my notes that the [ORGANIZATION] urban renewal area has an 18 percent as a –  opposed to the otherwise 30% set-aside, and this is a good [STREET] to spend that money. PERSON0, we like to say it's a floor, not a ceiling.",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"I think it could be a combination of public and private funding. We've got a lot of examples around the city where public sector and private sector come together around things that we value, and the city affordable housing being one of them. So I think we just apply some of the similar tools, but to industrial land.",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"And it has some special magical power, apparently. But the Fourth Amendment that has not been yet put on the table but we're debating does, in the amended language—  suggest that if there's a clear vision, you mentioned a moment ago that affordable housing could be a portion of it, but if we dispense with the requirement of a master plan in the event there's a clear vision that's been embraced and comes to us for approval, do you have a sense of what that vision could be?",portland
07_08_2015,affordable housing,"I think the simpler pieces to say, you know, listing in order would be affordable housing, number one. commercial and some residential in that order the property itself we own the small triangle that's jammed up against FAC0 and the railroad and the city owns the beautiful piece of property on the on the frontage roads there there's utilities in the [STREET] there's not good access at FAC0 and FAC1 i mean there's just a lot of issues to decide before anybody can really come together with a cohesive plan everybody keeps asking us for a plan",portland

08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Too often we respond to this as if it were a problem caused by the homeless. Too often we respond only to the needs of business owners afraid of a loss of customers, of neighborhood groups concerned with reduction of property values. [ORGANIZATION] has a reputation for handling homelessness better than other places in this country, and we have every reason to be proud of this, but we have even more important reasons to not become complacent.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness,"We fail to respond effectively again and again because we see the homeless first as a category of people or even an abstract problem rather than as individual citizens sharing the condition of homelessness. For this reason, we invent only institutional solutions, like homeless shelters, group homes, and in our better moments, clinics and soup kitchens. We treat homelessness as something that must be treated with a universal approach.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"In doing so, we fail to see that the needs of any given homeless person differ as widely from the needs of any other homeless person, as do the needs of any given citizen with a home from those from any other such citizen. We must acknowledge that any person can face financial ruin. Any child can be born into a home full of fear and abuse and thus seek to escape.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"It is time that we, likewise, stop assuming that we know the category of the homeless and what they need and that we can provide exclusively with large-scale institutions and shelters instead of how we look to deliver the needed infrastructure, assistance, and public service to those who have no common qualities except for the lack of a reliable home. I have a question. Can you ask a question?",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"You're incorrect. And it requires a lengthy explanation because it's affordable housing with funding sources that preclude doing that. But if you'd like a longer answer, we could probably get it for you from [ORGANIZATION].",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"Okay, but my understanding from what I read in the agreement, it does state that [ORGANIZATION] reserves the right to ask for rent increases on the property. But it's a federally funded program through [ORGANIZATION], and they cannot take an affordable housing project funded with federal dollars and move it above the federal income guidelines. Within the federal guidelines, okay.",portland

08_31_2016,homeless,"And with my colleagues from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON], we asked for more resources to address this emergency, and Secretary [PERSON] has advised us on how to get it done. Because of our state of emergency, our [ORGANIZATION] was able to tell the [PERSON] legislature that our housing situation is serious, and they lifted the preemption on inclusionary zoning, thanks in no small part, Commissioner [PERSON], to your advocacy down there in [PERSON]. And with the state of emergency, [PERSON] is fast-tracking incorporating inclusionary zoning into our city code, and we can also fast-track code changes to allow homeless shelters to be more easily sighted.",portland

But I think the most important voices that we are going to hear from [ORGANIZATION] will be those people who are experiencing homelessness or those who have overcome it. Because it is the trauma of that experience, I believe, that causes us to recognize that as long as we have men, women, and children in our community sleeping on our streets, we need to recognize that we have an emergency and do everything within our power to help them.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"But I'm also proud of the collaboration in creating [ORGANIZATION].

08_31_2016,homelessness,"You recognized that our local economy, which has improved circumstances for many, has created serious hardship for others. Unprecedented demand for rental housing and lagging supply have caused [ORGANIZATION] double-digit increases in rents at the same time that the real value of wages for the lowest-income households in our community has stagnated. This combination has pushed thousands of families to the brink of homelessness, and many are going over the edge.  finding themselves living in dangerously doubled up situations in shelters and parks and in vehicles all around the city.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"The declaration of the state of emergency galvanized our community to respond to the crisis in a [STREET] that is unprecedented in my experience. As [ORGANIZATION] laid out in greater detail, the declaration was the foundation for a series of new and accelerated strategies designed to address the emergency on multiple fronts.  to accelerate the creation of affordable housing, to expand financial and legal protections for tenants to prevent them from losing their housing, to expand the safe spaces, shelter spaces, for people who become homeless, and to significantly expand programs to help people who are experiencing homelessness get back into housing and keep that housing. Many of these are long-term strategies already laid out in the Action Plan for Home for Everyone, our unified community plan to end homelessness.",portland

[ORGANIZATION] reported in [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] saw a 14% increase in the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment to over $1,300 a month, the highest percentage increase of any city in the country. These increases far outpace any gains in income for low-wage households and leave people on fixed incomes, like ORG1 disability, unable to maintain the housing they have, and if they are already homeless, unable to find a [STREET] they can afford.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"These trends, along with the continued lack of prioritization at the federal level of affordable housing development, income supports, and services for vulnerable populations, explain why [ORGANIZATION], our community's information referral line, reports that they have taken more than 21,000 calls for shelter and housing-related services since the beginning of the state of emergency, including an average of 1,300 calls a month from people who self-identify as homeless. Calls for housing and shelter services to [ORGANIZATION] have gone from 35% of their call volume to 50% of their call volume in just [ORGANIZATION]. It's also why [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION], the average number of [DATE] residents at our ORG2 increased from 116 people per night to 146 people per night, an increase of almost 30% over [LOCATION].",portland

Your decision to extend the state of emergency will help sustain the critical momentum we have,  to implement policies and expand program capacity to help them through this crisis.

With the flexibility and new resources allocated during [LOCATION] under the state of emergency, we're on track to achieve this goal, but there is a lot of continued effort, investment, and code reform needed to finish the job and sustain our progress. As important as shelter is, as one part of our response to this emergency, we will only truly address the crisis if we significantly decrease the number of people who are losing their housing and becoming homeless, and if we dramatically increase our capacity to help people move out of shelter and back into permanent housing.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"With the declaration of the state of emergency, we committed to achieving the ambitious [ORGANIZATION] goals of having programs in [STREET] by [ORGANIZATION] to prevent at least 5,000 people a year from becoming homeless,  and helping at least 4,350 people a year move off the streets and back into permanent housing. We've begun to build that program capacity and scale up resources to achieve these outcomes, but we've only begun.  And beyond expanded homeless prevention and housing placement services, we need to continue the focus that the state of emergency has brought to rapidly increasing the supply of affordable housing units. Our ending homelessness strategies depend on significantly increasing the supply of deeply affordable and permanent supportive housing, and Director [PERSON] will speak to these efforts.",portland

Under the state of emergency, we are moving critical long-term strategies and investments forward at an unprecedented rate. In doing so, we are helping tens of thousands of people a year, and we are also setting an example for our state and federal partners, without whom we will not be able to truly resolve this crisis.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"Can I ask a question? Yeah, a question. PERSON0, I talk to people periodically who just don't believe that people are homeless because housing prices are rising.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"They understand housing prices are rising. They understand people are homeless, but they just refuse to believe that there's much of a connection. And I think there is a connection, but I'd love to have more statistics to give them to say, for example, here's what percentage of people who are homeless now are people who had a home [ORGANIZATION], but their rents went up and they couldn't find another [STREET].",portland
08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness,"So in the [STREET] count that we'll do in [ORGANIZATION], in part because you've asked this question, we'll be incorporating the kind of primary causality questions. I think we know from our providers, we know for example from our family shelter providers that a significant majority of the families they're seeing are reporting that they're homeless for the first time, that the cause of their homelessness was very much an economic crisis. We know from our providers that are trying to help people find housing that if someone is on less than $800 a month in long-term disability and rents for one-bedroom apartments are $1,300, that that financial piece is an essential barrier to their ability to get back into housing.",portland
08_31_2016,homelessness,"I really appreciate getting more of a breakdown in [ORGANIZATION]. I should also note that the [ORGANIZATION] did a poll on housing affordability and homelessness [PERSON] and I think that their data with people in the metro area also showed that a lot of people think the primary reason for homelessness is unemployment or unemployment  mental health issues, and not very many of them was simply the rising cost of housing. So it's not just anecdotal.",portland
08_31_2016,homelessness,"If you take 1,000 units out of the housing ecosystem in [ORGANIZATION], that's a value of about $380 million. It would cost that much to replace 1,000 units. So what you're seeing through this,  homelessness on the streets is some of these ripples, if you will, in the market rate housing, which cram people into the affordable market.",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"That's what I said. I mean, that's really striking because I think that one of the quandaries we've had in enforcing the rules we have on short-term rentals is that enforcement takes bodies to go out and do inspections, and it costs money. But if you're talking about that kind of return in terms of affordable housing, then spending a significant amount in enforcement might be well worth it.",portland
08_31_2016,homelessness,"The state of emergency over [ORGANIZATION], and I would say the momentum that it's generated, have achieved quite a bit. But those achievements need to be sustained because as we all know and as been said by everyone here [LOCATION], our homelessness crisis remains with us. So with that in mind, I wanted to offer a couple of insights and perhaps make a recommendation or two as you deliberate this issue.",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"And I wanted to focus my remarks particularly on shelter, which has come up a few times. My colleagues here and throughout this hearing will quite rightly emphasize the long-term overriding importance of housing and affordable housing in this issue. And I wholeheartedly concur with them, but wanted to mention a couple of things about our efforts which have drawn quite a bit of attention specifically around shelter.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"So the first is that the demand for shelter remains extremely strong. During [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] succeeded in helping over 800 individuals, formerly homeless, to regain their housing. And that represents an all-time high in our agency's [LOCATION] history.",portland
08_31_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"I can't understate, can't overstate how important that is as we look at providing quick, temporary, and immediate forms of support to people living on the [STREET]. If we're going to, I think, continue to move that needle forward in [ORGANIZATION], we're going to need, in this housing market, to make very strong and continue to make strong investments in housing and in the development of not only rental assistance but affordable housing. Finally…  I think the [STREET] forward, the one comment I'd make is that the state of emergency has brought a sprinter sense of urgency to the [STREET] this community has been addressing homelessness.",portland
08_31_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"We're looking at a series of sprints that will have to be sustained in [ORGANIZATION] and supported and really championed by this city council and the city councils that will follow it. So in [ORGANIZATION], I would simply recommend that we continue to focus our attention and dedicate significant resource in three smart investment areas –  shelter, rental assistance, and deeply affordable housing. Deeply because although our community has made strides in directing more resourcing towards affordable housing, we know that if we want to have a positive impact on the most vulnerable in our community, we need to be prioritizing housing that is affordable to those on the [STREET] looking to end their homelessness and regain their housing.",portland
08_31_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"The rate of rent increases, the request for double and sometimes triple deposit for apartments, requiring income that is three times the [DATE] rent in order to rent a unit, in addition to other screening barriers, is not only preventing people from moving inside, but also pushing people into homelessness. I hope the council commits to not only continuing the work to expand safety off the streets options, but also addresses the affordable housing need, as well as the tenant protection issues that have been far too long ignored. Blue in the face about why those reasons are, but I think that we all understand at a very complex level that there is a growing divide between government and the people.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,I became homeless and found out I was pregnant. Okay. And guess what?,portland

08_31_2016,homeless,"My understanding is that the city is planning to work with a person by the name of [ORGANIZATION], who apparently it's a $100 million investment for the FAC0 site. Now, for the 1,800 people that are homeless, that's about $50,000. The median house price is about $550,000 in the city of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"You could subsidize the building of triple the amount of houses, right?  based on just materials. It's also worth pointing out the fact that most of the people who are homeless are women, especially women who are trans, GLBT, veterans, and construction workers. I find it extremely sublimely ironic that many of the people who are homeless are the people who know how to build houses.",portland
08_31_2016,homelessness,"It's a notice of homelessness. I'm here [ORGANIZATION] to urge you and extend the declaration and ordinance of [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION].

08_31_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Acknowledge and act on preventing the homelessness in the first [STREET]. Before moving into this apartment [ORGANIZATION], I was already homeless. I lived in a hotel.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"I can't afford to be further from transportation that my family is dependent with. And all eight of the families that occupy this building that got this notice are in the same boat. And the truth is, on [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] we received the notice, is [LOCATION] we became homeless.",portland
08_31_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"This is happening [ORGANIZATION] all over the city, and we have no [STREET] to go. For people in this city, this rent increase in this magnitude or a no-cause eviction is just a notice of homelessness. And you know that we can't afford, that there isn't enough affordable housing for us.",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,You know that we can't wait for affordable housing in the pipeline to be built. You know that the application and screening barriers are too high for people like us to find anything. And [ORGANIZATION] is just [ORGANIZATION] worth of trauma and worry.,portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"So the management company is [ORGANIZATION], and they actually blame us. They say that [ORGANIZATION] is...  a victim of its own success. And they blame you guys for not building affordable housing fast enough.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"They will not sit down with us. They will not talk to us. And I really believe that you must utilize your power during the housing state of emergency, and you must protect the vulnerable people from becoming homeless.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"That we need housing for homeless people, but we also need to keep the people that are already in houses and in homes, we need to keep them housed. We need to keep [ORGANIZATION] housed. And this is a man-made disaster.",portland
08_31_2016,housing crisis,"It's also close to what we hope to build in [ORGANIZATION] with our housing bond. That's rental housing that's been eliminated for over 3,000 renters. The boldest move you could make is to invoke ORS 91.225, Section 5, to temporarily stabilize and protect renters until the legislature gives us back the regulatory tools we need to deal with this housing crisis.",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"And children in the affordable housing FAC0 can't go to FAC1, a school they can see from their sidewalk, and are instead bused to [ORGANIZATION], two miles away. How much is that costing the city? These classist policies echo the overwhelming message that [ORGANIZATION] has continued to send to the public.",portland
08_31_2016,houseless,"If you have money, [ORGANIZATION] represents you. Everyone else can just move. This has been evident with the complete lack of action toward slowing the rapid increase in rent throughout the metro area, the ballooning houseless population who continues to be swept from somewhere to nowhere, and the continued traumatic displacement of families by landlords who care more about their profits than people.",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"It's the families in my son's school at FAC0 who message me or email me and ask if I know where they can find affordable housing because they have no-cause evictions or rent increases they can't afford. It's the family of six, including triplets, who are [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], who had to move because of a no-cause eviction. They spent DATE2 camping in [ORGANIZATION]'s yard.",portland
08_31_2016,unhoused,"Since you declared the housing state of emergency [ORGANIZATION], the crisis is only getting worse. One thing is clear [LOCATION], it must be that. Tenants are still getting priced out and evicted for no just reason, and our unhoused neighbors are still being forced from [STREET] to [STREET] with no reasonable alternatives.",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"I'm not trying to say that you all haven't made any effort here. Honestly, I'm not. Investment in affordable housing and shelters is important, but what effort you have made, it just isn't enough, and it isn't meeting our most urgent needs.",portland
08_31_2016,unhoused,"But, you know, what I think you all need to recognize is that if a housed person on my block commits a crime, you do not send the police to evict our whole neighborhood. And our unhoused neighbors, our unhoused friends...  They need that level of dignity from you. They need to be treated as the individual human beings.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"Since then, the office has refused to answer questions about the move, leaving residents and neighbors uncertain of what comes next. In addition to [ORGANIZATION], camping continues to increase and overlook and to cause problems. This ordinance is big on language about the needs of [PERSON]'s homeless residents, and it should be.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"I know that you'd like to do more. I know that you're in the middle, and you have people that hate homeless. You have homeless advocates, and you have all these conflicting emotions.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"I believe that the new writing of this homeless emergency or this housing emergency should include tiny houses. We're working together with some churches, some other nonprofits, some organizations to buy land, to build tiny houses. I hate to call them tiny houses, small structures, emergency structures that will be put on the back of flatbeds and moved throughout the city to different churches and different organizations, private property.",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"So I'm glad you brought that up. I'd also like to bring up that you know we can't produce 1,800 units that quick you know we're typically as a [ORGANIZATION] you guys are usually spending about two hundred fifty thousand dollars on an affordable housing unit We can build these we can build these time is up appreciate it. Okay.",portland
08_31_2016,housing crisis,"I'm actually a social studies teacher of one of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]'s children. And also, I'm an owner-occupied landlord of a duplex. And I could speak from experience that actually I just spent some time writing some curriculum for teaching about the housing crisis.",portland
08_31_2016,houseless,"And as you know, over 50% of renters in [ORGANIZATION] are housing insecure. So even people that are not houseless yet are already insecure. And that includes ourselves.",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"Where do people go? Ultimately, we need permanent housing, affordable housing, really affordable housing, not what's for median family income of over $50,000. So that is something that you can do, and I urge you to do so.",portland
08_31_2016,housing crisis,"I see my friends searching for couches to sleep on or temporary places they can stay to avoid having to sleep outside. Others have no other option. My household has hosted folks struggling to stay housed, and I have seen the trauma and suffering of this housing crisis firsthand.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"So you can break away now.  from the state and all these stupid rules and do a little actual progressive solutions, you know? And, you know, you had [ORGANIZATION] up here, who's the housing commissioner of [ORGANIZATION], right? Well, you want to know what?  [ORGANIZATION] let me fall into the streets when I was homeless, and [PERSON] wouldn't even pay for a meth contamination to check my apartment when I was having health issues.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"You want to know what? I've actually seen in the [ORGANIZATION] group, this guy over there with the ORG1 beard in the back is the head of, right? And they're talking about throwing needles on the ground to make it look like homeless drug people are using drugs.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"right so I've seen that there's screenshots of it you know he  He can come up here and admit to the stuff that goes on and the fact that members of his group are out there harassing homeless women, beating up people, doing all kinds of vigilante actions. You guys don't care if there's serial killers, all kinds of people, you know.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"You had a homeless serial killer, [ORGANIZATION], who got released from prison pretty early. Okay, Mr. [PERSON], your time is up. And then he went around and killed homeless people.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,and a homeless service outreach worker. You guys don't care about anything. You're all about money and bullshit.,portland
08_31_2016,homeless,Mr. [PERSON]. How much money are you going to spend sweeping out homeless people and warring off the mentally ill homeless people  uh women and children [PERSON] everyone okay mr PERSON1 thank you call,portland
08_31_2016,homelessness,"Thank you. Mr. [PERSON]. And it's crisis capitalism in work, and that's why you guys want homelessness to continue.",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"I think we need to focus on that affordable housing bond. It's very important that that gets passed. We're talking possibly 1,300 more units out there.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"It's perfect. Perfect. But the reason I'm homeless again, I'm a resident at FAC0.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"I've seen more and more homeless camps go up. I have a friend of mine that got housed right after the declaration went in. And [ORGANIZATION], she was kicked out of her housing, and she joined housed her.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,So they kicked her out to put someone else in. That's not housing more homeless. What that's doing is that's just equaling out what there is.,portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"You guys got a serious problem with the homeless. And I don't know, you guys keep coming up with all kinds of different things and stuff like that. It's not working.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"These rich people, I'll go pitch a tent in their front yard. What I've told people is instead of worrying about the corridor, they need to move those homeless people up to the rich areas up here and pitch tents in their yard. Yeah, we can do that.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless,"But I think further than that, I'd  At least the thing that I touch on a lot is talking to our communities. There's a wealth of solutions that our communities could provide, but we have no [STREET] to provide those solutions. It has been funded to have these agencies deal with these established agencies to provide  kind of trickle down and almost this [ORGANIZATION]-esque trickle-down economics of aid to homeless.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"Mr. [PERSON].  Girls, just give us your name and you have [TIME]. Yeah, hi, my name is [PERSON], and I'm a homeless advocate. I just want to say in [ORGANIZATION], there was three of us that kept talking about the more need for shelters in 10 cities, which the  the council here and others kept saying, no, affordable housing and programs, that's what we need.",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"We kept telling you guys over and over, it's getting worse, we need this. This is a temporary solution. But no, you guys kept going for housing, affordable housing and also for programs.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"So we're in the solution right now, or we're in the problem right now, all these homeless people outside right now. It's not caused, or some of it is caused, I think some of it is caused by your decision-making of affordable housing, not putting people into temporary shelters or like we have 10 cities right now. So that's what we really need right now is,  a temporary spot for homeless individuals.",portland
08_31_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"I think that this should be extended, this state of emergency, but it should be extended until there's enough affordable housing for everybody, not just [ORGANIZATION], not [LOCATION],  but until there is enough affordable housing for everybody.

08_31_2016,affordable housing,"And  We are trying to do what we can with this issue in the city, but we do need help.

08_31_2016,homeless,"That is, there are people out there, families and struggling veterans and people that are homeless and struggling with addiction and mental illness, and our neighbors, our friends, our family members. We're 30,000 units short. So there's a huge problem in the market.",portland
08_31_2016,homelessness,"I mean, we've all heard and can't help but feel the passionate concern that people have about what's happening to [ORGANIZATION]. We are becoming unaffordable to too many of our friends and neighbors, and it is contributing to homelessness. and we are in a crisis.",portland

And just to amplify what Commissioner [PERSON] mentioned with respect to the bond measure that will be on this [ORGANIZATION]'s ballot, this will dedicate almost half the dollars towards providing affordable housing, permanently affordable housing for people on very low incomes. and half of it will also be dedicated to family-size housing, which is another area that the market is not meeting.",portland
08_31_2016,affordable housing,"So half of the units to be built under this bond will be two-bedroom or greater, and there's a screaming need for that as well. So I hope you'll all make sure that you get out and vote and spread the word about the importance of this bond measure in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm also happy to say that [PERSON] I'll be releasing my proposal to implement the inclusionary zoning proposal that will require new developments to provide affordable housing or to pay us into a fund so that we can develop affordable housing.",portland

06_10_2015,affordable housing,"The decision by your board to project-based 500 vouchers is a huge milestone. Your predecessor was a little more parsimonious with those vouchers. And to connect the dots, because of that initiative, Commissioner [PERSON] is going to be able to deliver on the council's commitment to affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_10_2015,homelessness,"Without those vouchers, it becomes very difficult because obviously the biggest challenge we face is on the service side. The collective efforts that you and the city have done over [ORGANIZATION] to reform the VASH voucher program and to go from an underperforming to an overperforming jurisdiction, which means we're getting more vouchers, which means we're going to likely meet the goal we've set, audacious goal of ending veterans' homelessness, is possible. You haven't just closed out your third FAC0.",portland
06_10_2015,homelessness,"If you take all the housing dollars, which we keep shrinking because of sequestration,  and we bundle them in a block grant, what will happen is over time it will continue to wither, and you will have some very tough choices to make about your long-term survival. But it seems hard to me to imagine in [ORGANIZATION] that we're going to have a home forward if we go down that path. So we're entering into [LOCATION], and I think it's about time that collectively we raised our voices again and said that if we're going to make progress ending homelessness and providing a range of housing choices for Americans, there must be a strong federal role.",portland
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"And [ORGANIZATION], I just wanted to also, and I think [PERSON] more or less alluded to it [TIME], but stepping forward with project-based vouchers for FAC0 or FAC1 affordable housing is really a tremendous opportunity. It's a great opportunity area, and we will have some good mixed-income housing there. And also recently your commitment of project-based vouchers to our [ORGANIZATION] property that we just acquired from [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"Well, neither the housing market, which is an inexorable, enormous force, nor the beleaguered citizen like the one we heard from [ORGANIZATION] who's trying to find affordable housing, acknowledges or cares about housing. bureaucratic turf doesn't matter the market cares not whether we have one housing agency 15 housing agencies good coordination or the lack of it and the again the citizen trying to find a foothold here  doesn't care either but what they ought to have a right to expect and what the market might respect a little bit is if the city and the county and [ORGANIZATION] are an effective partnership of public agencies doing coordinated work and i believe we have the structure for that now and i appreciate ORG1 engagement in that and then now having created that um  effective management structure that's incumbent on all of us, the housing commissioner, me, all five of us, and you and your board, to be very innovative and very aggressive in trying things, trying new things, trying to find more ways to address this problem with the resources we have.",portland
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mayor [PERSON]. We're very excited to bring this project forward for your approval. This will bring 47 new units of affordable housing to inner northeast [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_10_2015,homeless,"They're disproportionately representative in terms of people that are homeless and in certainly greater need of housing affordability in general. So this project really, in a lot of ways, addresses those kinds of issues. We chose the project on [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"So it's important for the [ORGANIZATION] to support other projects and having cash flow, it does a lot of things. One of the things is it obviously allows for the potential to support other projects in FAC0. And it also, I think, has an appropriate balance between our mission to provide affordable housing as well as our mission to sustain that housing.",portland
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"For the record, it's not unique to this project, this financing methodology that was just described. I want to make that clear for the record. It's commonly used in affordable housing at this point.",portland
06_10_2015,homelessness,"This project, as you know, is very important given all the data that's come out on homelessness and disparities particularly affecting people of color and in particular the African-American community.

06_10_2015,homeless,"It's important for people. We have people who are homeless that come through there. We have people who are now on staff at [ORGANIZATION], came through there that were homeless.",portland
06_10_2015,homelessness,"But it's no different. It's housing retention –  It's permanent housing placement over time. It's recovery, sustainability of recovery, because the addiction issues are so intertwined with the other issues that they're facing, including homelessness and issues around unemployment.",portland
06_10_2015,affordable housing,"So I think we've, through this effort and the work of [ORGANIZATION] and the council, we will now have...  an African-American-based grassroots organization that has not been displaced and that continues to offer services in partnership with a really good partner in [ORGANIZATION]. The other thing I would add is that [ORGANIZATION]'s experience with asset management of affordable housing real estate  will be a great help to the board and [PERSON] as they enter into ownership and potential purchase down the [STREET] of the property.

06_12_2019,housing crisis,"I've said this before, but it bears repeating the lack of compliance with our short term rental regulations is contributing to our housing crisis.

06_12_2019,homeless,"One item for every 50 emails we get on the homeless crisis or various manifestations of it. Yet, weirdly enough, and I see [PERSON] here, we heard very little about it. During the budget process and that sort of surprised me and maybe it's because as a council we all agreed that it was a hype You know the high priority and it was something that was important But it's sort of like we went through the budget process We talked a lot about certain things and then the channel got switched and right now I'm back to issues 1 2 3 [DATE] through 10 being the homeless crisis full stop",portland
06_12_2019,homeless,"Well, so too, it was Commissioner [PERSON]. I apologize, Commissioner [PERSON]. All of our homeless response is general fund, whether you're talking about, the joint office or a public safety component or a livability component is 100% general fund as well.",portland

06_08_2017,homeless,"The only thing I really want to address is I think I remember PERSON0 DATE0 made a comment about it seems unfair that we're providing these resources downtown when there's other parts in the city that have issues. Yes. I'd like to point out that a lot of the reasons that these people are down here, our officers especially, is because we do provide the resources for the homeless downtown.",portland
06_08_2017,homeless,"That's where the majority of the resources are, whether it be the homeless shelters, whether it's the mental health facilities. And so that's why it's critical to have these officers assigned here so they can deal with that.

08_09_2017,affordable housing,"Okay. Authorize the purchase of certain real property located at [ADDRESS] at a price not to exceed $3,720,000 to develop affordable housing. Colleagues, this property at 3000 Southeast...",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is large and ORG1 anticipates up to 300 units of affordable housing and homeownership opportunities that can be built here.

08_09_2017,affordable housing,"We're using all the tools available to help us move on addressing housing affordability, in this case funding from hotels and short-term rentals. We could use bond proceeds to develop the property if it meets the final criteria that you will vote on in the not-too-distant future.  stakeholders in [ORGANIZATION] have been working diligently on those criteria. We could also bring other resources to the table for affordable housing.",portland
08_09_2017,homelessness,"The most innovative part of this particular proposal is that while it's being permitted, we can use the space temporarily as shelter space.

08_09_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] is really quite distinguished amongst cities nationwide, especially on [ORGANIZATION], in that we are harnessing the sharing economy and the value created through the short-term rental platforms and redirecting that money to mitigate the loss of affordable housing. The inevitability of the sharing economy is such that we, frankly, as a city, decided that we weren't going to forestall it. They're active in every country, really.",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"So we began looking [ORGANIZATION] for appropriate properties that were large enough to hold significant property. investment in affordable housing. This particular site has been the location of [ORGANIZATION], one of 54 strip clubs in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"Yes, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I represent [ORGANIZATION] Super Watchdog X. At first –  I originally thought this was going to be purchased off the affordable housing bond, but I can see that is not the case.",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"Again, I like the numbers that I'm seeing as far as your –  projecting out maybe 100 to 300 affordable housing units. Again, I want to have a clear understanding when these projects are being presented, is one of the main focuses I want to see on these type of projects is how many jobs will be created when we do these projects. Because a lot of times on presentations, I don't hear that.",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"One question I might pose is that on the new development, can that be funded by the affordable housing bond, or do you plan on using financing from other areas? I'm not quite sure on that yet. I'll wait to possibly hear the answer.",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"I guess my only question was why was this not on the regular agenda? Because it's – It should have been on the regular agenda, and that's one of the reasons it's been pulled. Director [PERSON] – and frankly, I want these on the regular agenda because there is a narrative out there in the community that we're blowing off affordable housing.",portland
08_09_2017,homeless,"Is it the intent to use the building itself for the shelter? Yes, it is. We've been working with [ORGANIZATION].",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"PERSON0? Well, what's not to like about this? It takes lodging tax.  which is paid for by visitors, and I think all Oregonians like the idea of visitors paying us taxes, and we're taking that tax money and investing it in affordable housing and providing for a shelter as an interim use.",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], with all due respect to [ORGANIZATION] and the impact it will have on your employees, this is something that 300 units of affordable housing with a shelter as an interim use, as we all know, are sorely needed in our city at this time. And I'm very happy to support this project. Aye.",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"You, [PERSON]? Well, I certainly don't relish the idea of the city putting anyone out of business and decreasing jobs. But the reality is we're so far behind on our demand for affordable housing.",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,And I'm assuming that this particular lot is really our...  or most economic chance at creating affordable housing in this neighborhood. So I vote aye. PERSON0.,portland
08_09_2017,homeless,"Colleagues, I am very proud of the budget that we passed as a council [ORGANIZATION]. It's no surprise to anybody that [ORGANIZATION] is in the midst of a housing and homeless emergency. We're in need of infrastructure and [STREET] upgrades and replacements, and this budget prioritized addressing these issues with record investments that we collectively made.",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"We made another decision around affordable housing investments over other popular programs within [ORGANIZATION]. We had to shift resources. So...  Really, it's not about not listening.",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"It's been a long time since I've seen it. The second thing, just tell me what affordable housing is. I sure can't figure out what it is.",portland
08_09_2017,affordable housing,"We just can't find the money. Well, leverage some of that money and do a bond, like they just did on affordable housing. You didn't even try to save this program.",portland
07_19_2017,houseless,"They constantly harass houseless, people of color, women, protesters, or anybody who doesn't fall in line with [ORGANIZATION]'s authoritarian rule. So we're going to continue to resist. We're not going to stop.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"It's an actual insult to the think tanks out there and truly the brainchilds. Mr. [PERSON], Commissioner [PERSON], I give him the respect for the children's levy, the affordable housing bond, because he's earned it. Correct me if I'm wrong, [PERSON] was one of the people that used incorrect funds to fund some of the loos and didn't follow the charter.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"As you will hear in [ORGANIZATION]'s presentation, parties who cause the contamination or who are responsible for Superfund cleanup are not eligible for these tax incentives. Furthermore, the incentives are designed to reward community benefits, such as affordable housing, redevelopment in high-poverty areas, and equitable contracting. We know that no one tool is going to clean up [ORGANIZATION]'s brownfields, but a property tax incentive properly used will help us move one step closer.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"Okay. So on this slide, you can see that the general concept is that a property where brownfield contamination is cleaned up, 50% of the cost of eligible cleanup activities could be deducted from future property taxes over a set period of time. Additionally, if a property and a project fit certain priority categories for the city of [ORGANIZATION], for example, affordable housing, equitable contracting,  then additional incentives to the amount of 25% of the cleanup for each of those categories could be added to the incentive, and that would cap out at 100%.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"But, again, as we've conceptualized here, we're looking at a 50% tax exemption on a market rate development, and then additional percentages, 25% to 50%, can get applied for priorities such as affordable housing, [PERSON] contracting, and location in or near low-income areas, things like that. So, again, we've discussed these throughout the presentation. We have economic, social, and environmental impacts by implementing a program like this.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"Compounded by gentrification, we know that these same areas exhibit increasingly concentrated poverty. These findings support brownfield cleanup and redevelopment efforts that emphasize community benefits and prioritize areas of health and equity from both a racial justice and health equity perspective. The legislation that my former colleague, Senator [PERSON], championed, and which I was proud to vote for as the state legislature, that the city will make use of, is structured to incentivize cleanup and meaningful development in areas that experience high poverty rates, affordable housing shortages, and disproportionate environmental impacts.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"So you can choose to require public health and community-based benefits such as affordable housing requirements, [ORGANIZATION] contracting, and clean fuels contracting for cleanup activities, and I would encourage you to do so. Remediation and meaningful development will help bring brownfield sites back into productive use and back on the tax roll. The cleanup of these sites will also remove environmental threats and help improve our built environment, particularly for our most at-risk communities.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"Next up is [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] is too modest to mention this, so I will. In a prior life, [PERSON] was the architect of what later became known as the 30% set-aside, which mandates that 30% now more, thanks to some changes we adopted in [ORGANIZATION], but a minimum of 30% of urban renewal funds go to affordable housing.",portland
07_19_2017,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Also a little-known fact is that there was actually some pushback in [ORGANIZATION] when he came and lobbied for that. But he persevered, and we're still in a housing crisis, but I can't imagine where we would be [ORGANIZATION] if we didn't have that tool [LOCATION] to invest in affordable housing. So thank you, [ORGANIZATION], and welcome to [ORGANIZATION].",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"And, you know,  You know, you often hear me really focused on affordable housing and equitable jobs and jobs for underserved communities. Well, brownfields are a part of that equation because that is –  something that we have left in the hands of lower income communities and we have not taken care of. We have not done our job on cleaning up those brownfields and making those really fabulous places to serve our community.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,So it created its own...  uh set of problems but um there are um there are a lot of places like that scattered throughout the neighborhood and throughout the community and i think i don't know if somebody in the room can answer that question but one of the things that i like about you know the ideas that they're talking about is that there's incentive for doing affordable housing development with these properties and that's you know again we want to we want to incent the good behavior on that so i'm like you you know hopeful that we'll see a lot of good development coming out of this,portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"and i did see  The incentives for affordable housing development don't differ between using [ORGANIZATION] and not using because the cap is at 100% of the cost. In that infographic, that's what it looked like. Yeah.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"So what the infographic showed is that for each category of the five –  you would receive an additional 25%. So if, for example, it was an affordable housing development that also used equitable contracting, that would receive both additional 25%. It's just if you hit more than two categories.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"So if you use equitable contracting and affordable housing and you're in the high-poverty area, as we end up defining that, you would still cap out at the 100% because the...  The recommendation was that, and the state legislation carried forward, was that no one should receive more than 100% of what they actually spend on the brownfield cleanup. And we'll have a chance as a council to further discuss that when the recommendations come back, correct? Yes.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"Thank you to everyone who has brought us to this moment, and I'm very proud to vote aye. You DATE0?  Thank you, everyone, for being here and for bearing with me. So excited about this as an advocate for affordable housing because what we hear over and over again from developers is that land is too expensive and there's nowhere to build.",portland
07_19_2017,affordable housing,"And when I mentioned this 900 acres to a certain renowned developer in town, his eyes lit up like it was [ORGANIZATION].

08_10_2016,homelessness,DATE0 we can take the first step toward achieving what I believe can be an opportunity to truly change the landscape in terms of getting people experiencing homelessness permanently housed by tapping into private sector resources.

While Commissioner [PERSON]'s resolution does not specify which part of the site [ORGANIZATION] intends to lease, if the proposal is for the warehouse and the fenced asphalt yard, we estimate the fair market [ORGANIZATION] rent at approximately $1 million. But because [PERSON] and I have a significant disagreement about what is an appropriate rent to reimburse our ratepayers for this asset, and because it is illegal for ratepayers to subsidize a [INSTITUTION], I am proposing that ORG1 engage a third-party professional to determine the fair market rent for whatever portion of the site Commissioner [PERSON] or [ORGANIZATION] or whomever proposed to use.",portland
08_10_2016,homeless,"And then I have a question. By the [STREET], I'll second that because Commissioner [PERSON], in your opening remarks, you said this would be a privately funded facility, and I think we should clarify that. I have a clarifying question as to why [ORGANIZATION] is doing this when we very recently said that [PERSON] was going to do all services for homeless people.",portland

After I retired I have seen what her program has done for the homeless the proposed plan by the city For the homeless is ill-conceived as we look at it now the homeless need a [STREET] to be safe and get well Not a [STREET] Convenient for city planners because developer has offered a funding the project now being suggested does not have the structure to provide the services needed by the homeless and  The planned location is also inappropriate as it abuts an expanding residential community.",portland

This location is not going to be a success for the homeless population. The need to access services that will allow them to ascend to permanent housing.,portland
08_10_2016,homeless,We're concerned about the proposed homeless facility at FAC0 and  The site is an industrial site that lies at the outer fringe of the residential portions of our city. There are no existing facilities. The site has a dilapidated warehouse and a structurally weak pier.,portland
08_10_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] options are limited and sidewalks non-existent. The distinction between an internment camp and a successful facility for the homeless depends on resolving these challenges. Our firm has developed over 10,000 units of affordable housing all over the country.",portland
08_10_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"I testified [ORGANIZATION] to council as a [ORGANIZATION] board member in support of an affordable housing multi-grant for the developer of four large apartments in our neighborhood. I'm working with [PERSON] as a major supporter of the upcoming $258 million Yes for [ORGANIZATION] bond measure, but more germane to [ORGANIZATION]'s deliberation. For DATE2, I served on the board, including three as board chair of ORG2, which, as you know, is [ORGANIZATION]'s leading nonprofit addressing youth homelessness at its root causes.",portland
08_10_2016,homelessness,"The idea is the right source of resources, but the wrong use of them. I applaud [ORGANIZATION] leadership in bringing bold ideas forward for a citywide debate about homelessness. It's bold to declare a willingness to raise $60 million to immediately address the need for shelter.",portland
08_10_2016,homelessness,"But as a shelter site, FAC0 is set up for failure. Over [ORGANIZATION], I've spoken to leaders and advocates in the homelessness and housing communities. Many oppose FAC0 as a site, but those that are open to using FAC0 say that anything, including FAC0, is better than sleeping on the [STREET].",portland
08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Sleeping on the [STREET] is not an intentional act, but placing our most vulnerable community members at [ORGANIZATION] would be an intentional act. An act ignoring the significant contamination issues cited by the [ORGANIZATION], ignoring the lack of basic infrastructure at the site, the lack of safety on a [STREET] with heavy industrial use, missing and damaged sidewalks, and infrequent bus service. Best practices for developing shelter for homeless persons include distributing appropriately scaled shelter where people are,  We know that poverty and homelessness now exist to the east in our community.",portland
08_10_2016,homeless,"This is why the county's efforts opening shelter at FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION] and the 100-bed family shelter on the [ORGANIZATION]-Gresham border are so important. I've reviewed the list of sites the city has developed as possible shelter sites, and it appears that many sites have been excluded for the same criteria that would eliminate FAC1. I ask why?  I appreciate the challenge the city has in working through the multitude of objections virtually any proposed shelter site will encounter, but I encourage council to reexamine the list of your sites and select options which do not expose our vulnerable community members to the significant hazards at FAC1 and deliver safe shelter and services to locations where our homeless already live.",portland
08_10_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"I actually have built permanent supportive housing in partnerships, and we're currently working on a large affordable housing project with [ORGANIZATION]. From our relationships and partnerships with homelessness advocates and service providers, we know that warehousing large numbers of people into one space, apart from the services and support they need, is a poor and ineffective [STREET] to address this challenge. Instead, we should do what we know works, small shelters distributed throughout the community that provide targeted services for people with different needs, an approach already being successfully implemented throughout the region.",portland

08_10_2016,affordable housing,"We've been involved in several affordable housing projects. I've recently offered the city a building that we have in escrow in downtown called FAC0 on the same block as FAC1 that would be less expensive, safer, and more serviceable than FAC2. I understand FAC2 seems attractive.",portland
08_10_2016,homeless,"And there are two sites where my office is on our block between FAC0, FAC1, and FAC2.  Available on the open market, none of these sites are on the list. None. As a community, we need to pursue solutions that work and continue to support the work of a home for everyone and [ORGANIZATION], identifying sites that offer safe shelter,  accommodate the needs of different populations and provide access to services.",portland
08_10_2016,houseless,"That situation unfortunately did not work out, so I was back out in [ORGANIZATION]. I have been an advocate for houseless people and an advocate for self-organization. If you guys have any connection with modern science, systems theory works.",portland
08_10_2016,houseless,"[PERSON] are wrong, they are traumatic, and do not solve our problem. And I think, again, we have to look at our situation of perception of safety, because I hear it's a really big concern. It's a concern for houseless people as well.",portland
08_10_2016,houseless,"One of the big problems, I think, in [DATE] water corridor is the people who are houseless are concerned about safety and the people in the neighborhood are concerned about safety. But who are the people who are going to help organize people so they are safe? If people are organized, they contain their own safety and their own communication system and start creating community and start creating recovery.",portland
08_10_2016,houseless,And it's a very much bigger concept than who owns what. Because that's also a big problem. Native American people do not have houseless people.,portland

I work with [ORGANIZATION] on housing policy, an organizer with [PERSON], and I work with a couple of coalitions in [ORGANIZATION] that do direct outreach and organizing with houseless folks, the [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], both of which are working on looking at identifying and developing village-type models like [PERSON] to house the houseless. I have a lot of concerns about this proposal.",portland
08_10_2016,homeless,"It never works. You're going to spend a lot of money, and it's going to fail because you haven't done due diligence.

08_10_2016,homeless,"You're going to ask the people of this city to come up with $100 million to warehouse the homeless?  when [ORGANIZATION] is blowing their tops. And by the [STREET], [PERSON] is in the same position I am, but they're ugly. What they said [ORGANIZATION] was ugly, and I resent that.",portland

08_10_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"The reasoning for this was primarily the philosophy that it's better to get people straight into their own housing,  [ORGANIZATION], homelessness has only increased and we don't have infrastructure for them. Furthermore, the goal of maintaining a certain percentage of affordable housing within [ORGANIZATION], to my knowledge, we're very far off that goal. Even what affordable housing we have provided, I would question whether or not it is actually affordable to the 0 to 35 percent MFI range.",portland

08_10_2016,homeless,"But whether as a [ORGANIZATION] rental, transitional housing, or mass shelter, this form of infrastructure should have been preserved within the [ORGANIZATION] plan. To address neighborhood concerns, statistically, homeless are less violent than those indoors. From my own experience, what violence there is is overwhelmingly amongst themselves, and research has shown that even this violence increases when people need to jump from shelter to shelter, as is the case now in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
08_10_2016,homeless,We already have homeless people. camped out in front of elementary schools at FAC0. They're already causing problems downtown.,portland

08_10_2016,homeless,That's what we've said. We can't let the homeless people sleep on this contaminated land because we're going to sell it to a greenhouse or we're going to sell it to a brewery. The homeless people need to sleep there [ORGANIZATION].,portland
08_10_2016,homeless,[ORGANIZATION] doesn't want it in their backyard. But each one of those sectors needs something like this. We've got thousands and thousands of homeless people out there that are chronic victims.,portland

08_10_2016,homeless,"Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. I just wanted to show you, there's FAC0. A lot of people don't know what it is, but you can see there's an awful lot of vacant land around there that could be used for the homeless.",portland

Furthermore, the site is also contaminated, and the idea of putting homeless and houseless people on a contaminated site is completely inappropriate.

And I want to speak to the long-term...  of terminal one um one long term if it is going to become long-term affordable housing or housing for the homeless that's a conditional use relative to the comp plan that is a type three you would need to show available lands relative to the jobs first it transfers from  industrial to housing.",portland
08_10_2016,homeless,"the second part of that is goal 9 as a [ORGANIZATION] we struggled with meeting goal 9 and i know you did too through the comp plan and you raised the the cargo from low to medium in looking at that jobs category  Through the type three, you would need to prove that, again, in looking at how you're going to meet those jobs with an increased deficit. And so while I'm very supportive of doing something for the homeless, and I think that's a top priority, I encourage you to think about the long term.",portland
08_10_2016,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] and Commissioners, I'm [PERSON], a leader with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. We want to state strongly on the record that we support this only as a  We also want to express some of our concerns and ask for measures to ensure that this will, in fact, be temporary, transitional, and transparent.

08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness; affordable housing,"We're concerned that pressure to find good solutions will diminish if the homeless are simply moved out of sight. We're concerned that public money spent on literally warehousing homeless people will not only maintain the status quo for them and for our city, but that money will be diverted from providing true transitional and permanent affordable housing that is healthy, safe, and secure. We're concerned that those most knowledgeable about the problems and solutions of homelessness are opposed to the proposed long-term project.",portland
08_10_2016,homelessness,We also appreciate the distress of neighborhoods. And we can appreciate the pressures that you must fill to address the competing needs in our community. But we must appreciate most the needs of those people actually experiencing homelessness.,portland
08_10_2016,homeless; homelessness,"From their longtime advocates, we understand that the warehousing of homeless people tends only to lock them into warehousing and into continued homelessness. We have not had nearly enough time to meaningfully understand or respond to the full proposed project envisioned by [ORGANIZATION] until the community has had a reasonable time to consider its long-term implications. We ask for council's commitment to ensure that what passes [ORGANIZATION], if it does, is truly temporary.",portland
08_10_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"And if I could just take [TIME] to make two specific requests. Okay.

I've been to a lot of city council meetings where we deal with this, and this has to be the most preposterous idea that I've ever heard come out of this council or the previous one.

08_10_2016,homelessness,"I'm proud of that and we're going to stay clean on that issue and not spend ratepayer money on housing and homelessness as important as this priority is. So we don't need to pass this amendment in order to hew to that principle, but we do need to do some careful accounting and square up as is needed later on. But I don't see that we need to adopt these amendments in order to do that.",portland
08_10_2016,homeless,"I think it's important to give Mr. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] a chance to make this happen, a chance to see an expansion of our capacity to help homeless people with private money, and the with private money thing is important. And I also do think there is some urgency because it would be nice if we actually had a facility up and running before the cold weather hits. I've heard a lot of people say, well, there must be a bunch of other sites.",portland
08_10_2016,homeless,"And the [ORGANIZATION], I think, recently published a list of 120 sites that the mayor has looked at over there and [ORGANIZATION] looked at in [ORGANIZATION].

08_10_2016,homeless,"So if somebody comes to us in [ORGANIZATION] and says,  we have a plan for operating [ORGANIZATION] we've raised the money to do it we've got at least as good a plan for operating [ORGANIZATION] as [ORGANIZATION] has for operating FAC0 and the county has bought into it and since we're really opposed to FAC0 we'll only do [ORGANIZATION] FAC0 doesn't happen i'm would be opening to listening to that argument  I have suggested looking into FAC1, which is an underutilized city asset, as a [INSTITUTION]. It's fairly centrally located, has transit, bathrooms, showers, et cetera. It's my understanding that the city has had discussions with the trailblazers that sort of have the operating rights to that facility about that, and the blazers were willing to listen, but given their contractual obligations to other users, that's not something that could happen soon.",portland
08_10_2016,homeless,"As I said before, I think that the issue of the lease amount is something that needs further discussion. Again, I really, really appreciate everybody's testimony, and I'm not voting yes because I think the arguments against using FAC0 are bad arguments. I'm voting yes because I think that we are not in the position in this state of homeless emergency to look a gift horse in the mouth.",portland
08_10_2016,houseless,"We got a zoning confirmation letter. We know that the property is suitable for the proposed use. And then since we got that decided, we've been working with the community, the houseless community, to see what they want on the property.",portland

08_10_2016,homeless,"So I wanted to...  Thank you for the whatever behind-the-scenes work had to be done with [ORGANIZATION] and Governor [PERSON]'s office to get these homeowners, who are not the most affluent and politically influential people in [ORGANIZATION], some release and assistance. The gentleman who just testified, of course, alluded to some people almost wish there might be flooding along [ORGANIZATION]. I hope that as you also look at other ways government can work that people,  we can target government action towards the problems like this flood insurance issue and dealing with people using the criminal system the [STREET] it's supposed to be used to deal with people who have a problem where they become criminals who deal with methamphetamine or bicycles, not uniformly acting against some homeless people who are close to having stable micro-community housing in [PERSON].",portland
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"The key themes that we really heard is that there is support for [ORGANIZATION]. and we heard loud and clear that there's support for affordable housing, but there was support for mixed income that includes affordable housing.

08_10_2016,affordable housing,"Yes. Good question, Commissioner [PERSON]. I can tell you right now the project that's being proposed at the FAC0 and FAC1 site, the [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 team, we've heard loud and clear from community members that they would like to see a mix of affordable housing and obviously ORG2 would play a role in supporting that up to the 60 percent MFI level.",portland
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"And with this money that's designated to be spent in the FAC0 area, I'm hoping that some of that money that isn't the affordable housing money can be spent to subsidize that so we can get that mix of housing that we desperately need in that area. We need affordable housing, but we also need the other housing as well in order to have a mix. Okay.",portland
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"Great.  excited to have them thank you all right others who would like to speak on this point come on up please welcome hi my name is [ORGANIZATION] and I build apartments in the [ORGANIZATION] area I've been in front of you before and testified the last time was FAC0 on FAC1, and I praised that program because it worked, and it opened up that area for further development. And since then, and one of the things I said is I wanted to develop –  market rate and affordable housing in that area just south of FAC2, [PERSON].",portland
08_10_2016,affordable housing,"It more than triples my cost. And I think this is a good time to look at an LID for the whole area because...

07_08_2020,affordable housing,"I actually was concerned about this because I was concerned that the affordable, well, the 60% MFI units  would be something that would be down the [STREET]. So I'm very supportive of those units being built first, because we've had that experience in [ORGANIZATION] where developers run out of money halfway through a project and oops, what didn't get built was the affordable housing unit.

08_19_2015,homeless,"We can build buildings alongside this facility on the industrial land, possibly large manufactured buildings that can be used as temporary shelters, and also bring in the manufacturers to work with people, provide employment, provide ways that they can also utilize the space to build their products, to build. lift the homeless up and provide housing and shelter. It's a transitioning center to get people into permanent housing with the developers, and this bond will benefit at this time.",portland
08_19_2015,houseless,"And we approve that in the budget, the 90,000 position in [ORGANIZATION]. And so with the remaining from that originally $380,000 that was budgeted, the unknown costs yet are going to be if there's an office build-out or if we have to move them to a different space to get that locking door private office, which is required by [ORGANIZATION]. And the focus groups, which the ORG2 has identified, to really hear from houseless communities, youth communities,  the LGBTQ communities who might not necessarily be reached in the [ORGANIZATION] required mailing survey to home addresses.",portland
08_19_2015,homeless,"If you're going to offer up millions of dollars for simple citizen review boards and different accountability boards, then you might want to give cameras to  a group of citizens or even sponsor some paid cop watch groups that go around and film the police and how they deal with the mentally ill people and homeless people and all kinds of different people in this community that are disproportionately affected by police abuse and corruption and misconduct and [ORGANIZATION]  I can't even believe that you asked that question about why there needs to be certain focus groups to deal with members of the different communities. That really shows that you don't get it and that you are obviously not qualified to hold any position of power in this town if you can't even...  that different people are affected differently by the power structure and the police. I know it's easy for you to just be a rich white man in a [STREET] of power.",portland
08_19_2015,homeless,"You come from a [STREET] of white supremacy and a position of power, and you can't understand how the rest of us are treated. Well, you know, [ORGANIZATION], I remember when you were saying you're going to go sleep with the homeless, you know. I think you should still do that and do it for [ORGANIZATION] with maybe not a G4S security guy to back you up.",portland
08_19_2015,homeless,"You could...  probably find a couple of homeless people that would make sure you're safe or even more safe than your G4S security guys. But I suggest that [ORGANIZATION], that you go out and sleep in the streets too, and every one of you guys, and then you might have some perspective. Go do [ORGANIZATION] in the streets in the dead of [LOCATION].",portland
09_09_2015,affordable housing,"Yes. okay let's move on then please 921 request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding affordable housing and over building in [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] [PERSON] welcome so I started out with with some  Some things I found when I was going through the papers I had in the boxes of stuff I collected over [DATE], and I found this campaign thing of this guy named [PERSON].",portland
09_09_2015,affordable housing,People live on the [STREET] because they can't find affordable housing. I went through this myself [ORGANIZATION]. I talked to [ORGANIZATION] office about it.,portland
09_09_2015,affordable housing,"if you'll see the the mayor and the Commissioner [PERSON] at that time he resigned shortly after that promises [ORGANIZATION] of community leaders to find new revenues for affordable housing at 50% or below the medium income guess who promised this you know besides the mayor and the commissioner skin a guy named private developer PERSON1 heard of him  He's still promising, and I saw the leader of [ORGANIZATION] at that time, the minister from [ORGANIZATION]. He said he's still telling us stories. He's still telling us, and we're buying them all the time, what he's going to do for affordable housing.",portland
09_09_2015,affordable housing,"The rent for a single person over there is $1,100. Wow.  that's a hassle project over there which distance is it's nice for you guys you could afford that all of you could afford it an apartment like that but lots of schedule mr. [ORGANIZATION] and mr. [PERSON] didn't tell us the truth back then and the [ORGANIZATION] wrote me a letter PERSON2 wrote me letter saying that eventually we'll get affordable housing in the city eventually the whatever the hell does that mean two more pages will be done here it's that I don't I don't [TIME] is not very long  there's some priorities in this city that you should look at. I don't think that fixing the FAC0 and buying the post office are big priorities.",portland
09_09_2015,homeless,"One of the only other issues I have within the city of [ORGANIZATION] is that we shouldn't deny the most vulnerable people to also have access to the transportation. And I'm not seeing enough passes being given to a lot of the homeless out through the city. And that kind of disturbs me because...  Of all the people that really need access to medical, to jobs, to going different locations, that would be the homeless.",portland
09_09_2015,homeless,"And yet we give money to certain nonprofits that say to you, you need to tell us who you're going to see and we'll call them to verify that. But in my mind, having the people through the city that are the most vulnerable have access to go to different locations is very important to the city community.  from a beneficial of people getting more jobs, people having access to doctors, people being able to go to see their friends, their relatives. And because they are homeless, they're being denied that access because city leaders are not looking at that and saying, we think the students deserve to have these passes, but the most vulnerable people in this city do not.",portland
09_09_2015,homeless,"So I question your decision, Dr.  on denying the homeless access to free passes on the transportation to improve their lives, possibly get a job, possibly get housing, possibly improve their health. So again, I just question your thinking on this, and I hope that you'll look at this a little bit closer and maybe decide to offer that to at least the, quote, 2,000 that we keep throwing that number out,  that are chronically homeless throughout this city. And again, even if you offered transportation [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] to this group, the benefits to them to be able to improve their lives would be enormous.",portland

08_23_2017,houseless,"I oppose this project simply because, number one, I don't understand how [ORGANIZATION] has the funding to make improvements that a neighborhood clearly does not want and nor can they afford, but they can't put in a crosswalk. And number two, I oppose it because every single time  you give the go-ahead for anybody in this city to develop or improve anything, the houseless get shuffled around, arrested, swept. Just on the [STREET] here [ORGANIZATION], we were watching cops harass houseless under the bridge on FAC0.",portland
08_23_2017,housing crisis; houseless,"What?  I mean, it's ridiculous. So, I mean, where is [ORGANIZATION]'s plan when they come in and do this so that the impact isn't so traumatizing on the houseless in that area when they get shuffled around and moved again for an unnecessary improvement? Where is [ORGANIZATION]'s plan to reduce the impact on this neighborhood and whether or not they can afford these improvements, especially when we're sitting in the middle of a housing crisis?",portland
08_23_2017,houseless,"Right. Or is just everything in this city about money? Oh wait, it's not because we're still waiting on that $50 million for the houseless.",portland
08_23_2017,houseless,"We know how the city works. And the city doesn't work for the people. The city works for builders, contractors, different forms of employment, taking away people's homes, all kinds of things that are egregious when the houseless aren't even getting the money that you aren't dealing with, Mr. [PERSON], until [ORGANIZATION], which was supposed to be started, I think, in [LOCATION] from the budget.",portland
08_23_2017,houseless,"We don't want people drinking dirty water. But the [STREET] that we describe houseless people are as dirty, not myself. I don't describe them this [STREET].",portland
08_23_2017,houseless,"But the common language is they're filthy, they're broken, they're mentally ill, all kinds of things, meaning all...  all of which are similar to how we describe what's going on with sewer pipes. So I'm just saying, maybe we could look at the fact that we're so easy giving money for fixing sewer pipes, which we should be, but apply that to the ease of...  of giving money to fix the houseless problem so that people can have clean water, be clean, have a sense of cleanliness for themselves, be less broken so that they can get fixed through the systems that are here that also need fixing, but at least they're somewhat in [STREET] for people to get the therapies that they need, the addiction treatment that they need to avoid jail, to avoid issues of maybe having their dogs killed because they're living outside and they're not okay, and And I just want you guys to think about it.",portland
08_23_2017,houseless,"You know, the similarity of how we talk about things and applying money to things and giving contractors money to fix things. I'm asking you to fix the houseless problem. I'm asking you to come up with the fix.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Okay. All right, 698, please. Establish a construction excise tax to fund affordable housing initiatives from an inclusionary housing fund.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Commissioner [PERSON]. Thank you, Mayor. As all of my colleagues know,  The lack of affordable housing is the greatest crisis facing our city right now, and the current market conditions are increasing the crisis.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"We have thousands of people literally living on our streets. We have unprecedented rent increases, more than 15% on average [ORGANIZATION] over [ORGANIZATION], the highest in the nation. The rising rents, coupled with extremely low vacancy rates, have made affordable housing options scarce for low- and middle-income Portlanders.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And quite frankly, new development, both residential and commercial, is continuing to put more stressors on the need for affordable housing. We have worked hard in this city to ensure that jobs are located close to where people live. And I think that was one of our cornerstones of the comprehensive plan that we adopted [ORGANIZATION], is people need to be able to live near where they work.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"We have a documented need right now for 24,000 units of affordable housing, and that need is growing as the city continues to grow. In the comprehensive plan that we adopted [ORGANIZATION],  we acknowledge the need for an additional 10,000 units of affordable housing on top of that 24,000 units of need right now over [LOCATION]. New commercial and residential developments in the city must pay their freight towards supporting affordable housing, both commercial and residential development.",portland
06_16_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And that's what we're presenting [ORGANIZATION] to you is a proposal to do exactly that,  we are proposing to establish a 1% commercial excise tax on residential construction and on commercial construction. This is not the solution to our housing crisis, but it is an important cornerstone of funding new affordable housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. Some of the other things this council has done is [PERSON] we increased the amount of urban renewal money dedicated to housing projects.  by nearly $67 million for affordable housing.",portland
06_16_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"DATE0, the council will consider an inclusionary zoning program for adoption, which will include some increases for developers, incentives for developers, excuse me, which this construction excise tax will provide some funding for. And I will be bringing to council a referral to the voters in [LOCATION] to ask them to help solve this affordable housing crisis even more.  by supporting a general obligation bond for affordable housing development. Our city's workers, our families",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And although [ORGANIZATION] is on leave, [PERSON], I know, worked [TIME] a day on this because I got calls from her after [TIME] and on [ORGANIZATION]. But specifically, Senator [PERSON] was the prime sponsor of [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], chair of ORG1 [ORGANIZATION].  ORG2 and Speaker PERSON4 were all directly involved in the details of this bill and the creation of the construction excise tax option for all cities and all counties in the state of [ORGANIZATION]. The underlying purpose was to tap the hydraulics of the private sector to deliver a wider spectrum of affordable housing than we could do with direct public financing.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"To summarize, the [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] provides for mandatory inclusionary zoning above 80% of the median family income, and it allows for and recognizes that the use of voluntary inclusionary zoning below 80% of MFI is statutorily permitted. At the same time, they lifted a preemption on the levying of local construction excise taxes for affordable housing. This authorized all cities and counties except for [ORGANIZATION], who had previously enacted a construction excise tax prior to the preemption.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And the remaining 35% would be made available for affordable housing for households under 60% of the MFI. The commercial tax revenue, we are recommending that 100% be allocated to housing for households under 60% of the MFI. Just to clarify on that previous slide, for the residential, those percentages are set in state law?",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And so we're very confident with that legislative interpretation. With respect to exemptions, the first category are required state exemptions. Affordable housing at or below 80% of the median family income.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"As a council, you're providing incentives to contractors to provide affordable housing. It's the [ORGANIZATION] program. We think that this should work in concert with the [ORGANIZATION] program and recommend that households that are affordable for sale be exempt from the excise tax.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Of that, 15% would be provided to [ORGANIZATION]. 50% would be made available for inclusionary zoning incentives, and 35% remaining for other affordable housing programs. And as you can see, of the commercial revenue, 100% would be allocated to affordable housing programs.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"So that's about $8 million per annum, and I think it's important to focus on per annum because some of the press have taken this slide to mean that it means $8 million over [ORGANIZATION], which is incorrect here. To put this in context, in the [ORGANIZATION]'s budget of $150 million, this would constitute about 7% of the total budget going forward. The other thing I'd like to say is that with the [ORGANIZATION]'s prior action having to do with short-term rentals, [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, which is taxing tourists for affordable housing, your efforts to harness the budget,  tax increment financing for affordable housing.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"The short-term rental funds, thanks to your approval of our [ORGANIZATION] budget, we're going forward with the securitization of that revenue with a revenue bond with the finance office [LOCATION]. That would generate, over DATE2, about $18 million. With respect to the residential inclusionary zoning incentives, using the trend analysis that [ORGANIZATION] prepared and that we've just summarized, we would generate between $47 and $57 million as offsets and an additional $31 to $41 million in affordable housing revenue for residential only.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,And then the commercial sector would be contributing between $45 and $55 million. So...  Each of these are important parts of the solution to affordable housing. The mandatory inclusionary zoning was contemplated in the [ORGANIZATION] comprehensive plan.,portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,The impact statement that accompanies the ordinance says –  The purpose of this legislation is to authorize a construction excise tax on residential and commercial development to fund the production and preservation of affordable housing at or below 60% MFI. I want to see if we can avoid confusion here because the ordinance talks [DATE] and below. The impact statement makes clear we're talking about 60 and below.,portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"I don't want there to be a future council that gets confused. And for the record, [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION], what I would –  offer on the first recital is that for the revenue that is sourced that the [ORGANIZATION] would be able to use for affordable housing production and preservation, the intent would be to be 60 and below, but the incentive fund associated with the mandatory inclusionary zoning program would be at both the 80 percent and below 80 percent levels. So, [PERSON], maybe at some later point, could you see if there is a friendly amendment to be acceptable to the sponsor that takes the very clear statement in the impact statement about the purpose of the legislation and just incorporates it into the ordinance?",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And we spent a lot of time, probably [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] on this very point because we're not underwriting their projects. Therefore there's not a dollar for our dollar offset but there is a good faith effort in  In addition, in order to provide for affordability at or below 60% of median income, we can provide optional additional services, including density adjustments, expedited service for local permit processing, modification of height, floor, or other site-specific requirements, and  additional financial incentives, which would either allow us to increase the number of affordable housing units over and above the base of 20 percent, which the statute allows for, decrease the sale or rental price of affordable housing within the units, or  or build affordable housing units that are equal to or lower than 80% of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And then on the 35% that goes to affordable housing under the residential improvements and the 100% of the commercial improvements, Commissioner [PERSON] will be coming back with a recommendation of how those are allocated. Final question, there's a proposal that's been floated to create one or more exemptions for otherwise laudable purposes. The one that caught my attention is brownfields.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"I want to go back to the issue of classifying commercial, multifamily as either commercial or residential. And I want to start out by saying that unless somebody has some reason for not dedicating 100% of the commercial to affordable housing, that's where I start from because I do believe that tax is worth less when there's a nexus between the purpose of the tax and what you use it for and what's taxed. So given that...  Given that, and I haven't heard anybody else on the council saying that we shouldn't have 100% of the commercial going to affordable housing, although I think we have some discussion about what purposes that might be.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Well, I think we should have some more discussion about that right now because –  We know that at least last time I checked, 40% of [ORGANIZATION]'s property taxes never come back to the [ORGANIZATION] area. And I'm, for one, I'm not happy about three-quarters of a million dollars a year going to do affordable housing in other parts of the state. If there's a possibility that by classifying multifamily as residential, that means that if we can keep it as commercial, that means all the money stays in [ORGANIZATION] and all that money can be used for affordable housing.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"The other concern I have is that the ordinance says that it's for production and preservation of affordable housing, the 50% of the commercial that's not dedicated specifically by the statute. And I'm wondering if there's an interest from the community and on the council for including operations as a potential use, operations of affordable housing. If we pass the general obligation bond to build a lot of publicly owned homes.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"affordable housing, we're going to need money to operate it from. And so I'd be interested in allowing future councils to decide how to use that money for affordable housing and broadening it just slightly. I understand the point.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And so I would argue that we save the operations argument maybe for [ORGANIZATION] and focus on new affordable housing production 100%. Okay. Presumably, since this is a dedicated fund, [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] will be making a recommendation to future councils as to the allocation of the money.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And even in a perfect world, the new affordable housing that might be funded by the bond that we haven't passed yet wouldn't be online for [ORGANIZATION], right? Right. i think i would like us to consider that at least okay more questions for [ORGANIZATION] if any all right",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,The key thing for me is that 96% of this commercial excise tax revenue be devoted to the production of affordable housing. The city did a great job. They worked hard with the state legislature to get inclusionary zoning done.,portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And I hope it all goes to where I think it should go, and that's to affordable housing. I think we're all agreed on that. I'm just trying to get more to go to affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"It's been described as being [ORGANIZATION]. In [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] initiated a process to really analyze a broad range of housing and land use tools to ensure both an adequate supply and equitable distribution of affordable housing across the region. At that time, they had identified inclusionary zoning as one of those potential tools.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"So with SB [DATE], passed recently by the [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION] legislature, we've cracked open both inclusionary zoning and the construction excise tax. And I believe the intent all along by legislatures was that the [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION] be used towards affordable housing. I want to acknowledge, however, that with all this hard work, we are still far short of where we should be and where most other places are with [ORGANIZATION].",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Many essential systems that serve the public are supported through impact fees by the [STREET] of SDCs, such as transportation and parks, but affordable housing doesn't have one. Collecting a construction excise tax in the midst of a booming housing market and reinvesting in our community's greatest needs is the right step to ensuring that our communities are accessible by the [STREET] of affordable homes. As a member of [ORGAN[ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION]ATION] working to provide input on the city's development process for [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION], it's good to see that the city is moving quickly on the [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION], half of which is dedicated towards the incentive funds needed for when a mandatory [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION] policy is adopted in the future.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"It's good that we are maximizing the residential side of the tax as allowed under the state statute, and we are supportive of the city's efforts to move quickly to implement this revenue source for new affordable housing production and preservation. On the commercial side, however, while I can understand why it's also being capped at 1%, despite having no such limitation in state statute, I remain unconvinced that we're truly maximizing this revenue source. I look forward to the findings in the upcoming nexus study and financial feasibility study in the inclusionary zoning process to see if there's a basis for a higher tax rate.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Many of [ORGANIZATION]'s members are the low-wage workers who will labor inside these new commercial buildings, yet are forced to live far from their jobs because of the lack of affordable housing. The impact of these developments in a hot housing market needs to be captured and maximized in every instance and quickly. Thank you, Commissioner [PERSON] and the team you've assembled to work on housing issues.",portland
06_16_2016,homelessness; affordable housing,"I recognize these conversations have moved quickly, and we appreciate your leadership during a crisis time and when inaction on housing policy results in real-life consequences for individuals and families. Overall, I'd like to impress upon [ORGANIZATION] that we need a comprehensive strategy to address housing affordability. We need a variety of policy tools working in concert to address the full spectrum of housing needs, from ending homelessness with investments in affordable housing infrastructure to ensuring that fair housing laws are upheld so that housing discrimination ends now, in our lifetimes, and isn't passed on to future generations.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"It really is [ORGANIZATION] to be able to talk to you about this first impact fee for affordable housing, essentially. Usually – so I'm [PERSON] with [ORGANIZATION]. We are a coalition of over 140 organizations [LOCATION].",portland
06_16_2016,homeless; housing crisis; affordable housing,"We're all the usual suspects, like the frontline workers in homeless services and the developers of affordable housing –  but we're also neighborhood associations and healthcare workers and educators and small businesses, because as you know, our housing crisis is impacting all of us. And at [ORGANIZATION], we're working to address the historic affordable housing crisis that has been before us. with our community members with the lowest incomes.",portland
06_16_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And in order to address this part of the housing crisis, we know that the only solution to getting rents down to $200 and $300 and $400 a month, which is what is affordable to a senior on [ORGANIZATION] or a mom raising a couple of kids on a minimum wage job, the only [STREET] we can get rents at this level of affordability is by investing money. in the public infrastructure of affordable housing. and so that's what's very exciting about [ORGANIZATION] is we're for the first time saying affordable housing is part of our public infrastructure and like the infrastructure systems of parks and schools and roads we are going to make affordable we're going to add affordable housing to that list and give affordable housing its impact fee because we value it as part of the infrastructure that makes our community great for everyone and that's how we need to start building our city",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"and i believe this is the right step So we at [ORGANIZATION] are calling for you to keep it 100 with the construction excise tax, and that means dedicating all 100% of this revenue to affordable housing. We're glad to hear that support.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And I would just add that it doesn't all trickle down. We're not, the market is not building deeply affordable housing, and we can't leave it up to the market to stand aside and let the market or expect the market to be able to build these $200 and $300 and $400 apartments. We have to find the resources to invest in this public infrastructure, and this is one of them.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you. [ORGANIZATION] worked diligently on this legislation in [ORGANIZATION], and we are very excited to be here supporting the outcome of that legislation, including the construction excise tax, and we look forward to the proposal on inclusionary zoning. Affordable housing for our members who sit right in that middle income range between the 50% to 80% of MFI is absolutely critical.",portland

06_16_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And we're all working towards equitable, affordable communities across the entire state. So I really want to commend this entire council for the bold steps you've already taken to address the housing crisis here in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. And we're here to ask you to continue that by supporting this proposed construction excise tax and by committing to dedicating 100% of the funds to affordable housing.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"As the crisis continues to worsen, that those folks who can will pay into a new funding source for affordable housing.

We appreciate the efforts by the city and the county through [ORGANIZATION] initiative to house the homeless and adding hundreds of emergency beds in [ORGANIZATION] so that people have a safe [STREET] to sleep at [TIME].

06_16_2016,affordable housing,Families have to move far away to find affordable housing. That causes them to be far away from their established support networks and causes their kids to have to constantly change schools. What they need is a permanent [STREET] to call home.,portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"And what we need right now is a more permanent solution, a systemic long-term strategy to create more affordable housing through the construction excise tax and dedicating 100% of it to affordable housing. so that our vulnerable immigrant and refugee communities can find a [STREET] to call home and do not have to be displaced and removed from their communities again and again, so that as [ORGANIZATION] becomes a thriving city, our immigrant and refugee communities can thrive together with the city.

Good turnout. our members hail from all across [ORGANIZATION] they're as diverse as our city but the one thing that we've heard again and again as you have cutting across geographic and social boundaries is that the cost of housing in [ORGANIZATION] is too high you know this as well as anyone you've declared a state of emergency and we thank you for the commitment you've shown in taking concrete steps to ease our housing crisis but despite the gains made in [ORGANIZATION] both locally with the increase in tiff funding which we thank you for your support on  And at the state level, with the loosening of the inclusionary zoning restrictions, the housing situation here in [PERSON] continues to worsen.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], that need is clear, and so we strongly support Commissioner [PERSON]'s proposal to allocate 100% of the construction excise tax money to housing. The money generated by the [ORGANIZATION] can't make up the difference, as you've noted, but it can help fill in gaps in our affordable housing infrastructure. Many [ORGANIZATION]ers cannot afford the workforce housing that inclusionary zoning is designed to provide, and most [ORGANIZATION]ers do not live in an urban renewal area eligible for [ORGANIZATION] funding.",portland

[ORGANIZATION] is really special, dear, and unique to me, but in a [STREET] I also have many patients like [ORGANIZATION], whose life circumstances preclude them from living happy and healthy lives. And these circumstances are so entangled with what we do in medicine, we call them the social determinants of health, that a colleague at [ORGANIZATION] and I started an initiative to organize patients and community partners to better identify and address these social determinants. In organizing meetings with over 60 patients [ORGANIZATION], we quickly found that the most prevalent and significant influence in the health and lives of our patients is lack of secure and affordable housing.",portland

06_16_2016,housing crisis; affordable housing,"For [ORGANIZATION], a ban on inclusionary zoning prevented construction of affordable housing on any meaningful scale in any city in our state. That ban has a large share of responsibility for the housing crisis that we stagger under DATE1. It was put in [STREET] in the interests of industry lobbies at the expense of our communities.",portland
06_16_2016,housing crisis,"DATE0, our legislature considered a bill to finally lift the ban on [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] testified in support of that bill, as did the city of [ORGANIZATION] and every other jurisdiction in [PERSON] who testified, along with a broad spectrum of other community nonprofits, all of whom feel the crushing effects of the housing crisis on the people and communities we serve. It's important here to recognize that some developers, we heard from one, responsible developers also went out of their [STREET] to testify in support of lifting that ban, the bill in its original form.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"So we were distressed to see a decent bill loaded up with amendments, weakened and constrained from accomplishing the good that was intended originally, and  The final legislation seemed, according to testimony in those hearings and questioning from [ORGAN[ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION]ATION] members, the bill seemed to have, in its final form, seemed to have been shaped largely, again, in the interests of industry lobbies, in strong-arm deals without the presence of virtually any community voice. [ORGAN[ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION]ATION] like ours were forced to hold our noses and urge passage of the legislation anyway, in favor of getting the chance for a little more affordable housing rather than no improvement at all. The bright spot, though, in the [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION] compromises was the ability to institute a construction excise tax and have some [STREET] to pay for affordable units for people earning below 80% of median family income, for which the final [ORGAN[ORGANIZATION]ATION] legislation made no provision at all.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"We urge you to ensure that here in [ORGANIZATION], no powerful industry interests will bring the [ORGANIZATION] rates to any level below 1%. The home builders and realtors lobbies already have their [STREET] with the state legislation, hampering our ability to begin closing the gap of dire need for more affordable housing. We hope you'll draw a line for [ORGANIZATION]ers and provide courage to other communities.  by establishing both residential and commercial [ORGANIZATION] rates at the maximum possible and with no additional exemptions.",portland
06_16_2016,affordable housing,"I think there's other benefits and amenities to developing and locating in [ORGANIZATION] that make it beneficial for people who want to do that. I think ultimately when you're looking at these issues, they were very complicated. The property tax bond, the inclusionary zoning, the construction excise tax, demand management fees.  changes to far bonus systems changes in heights and different things like that that were contained in the comprehensive plan are complicated and they and they come together when somebody's looking at a potential development and wanting to just fully understand that is really was really our objective in our comments not that we have any fundamental opposition to a Support for affordable housing, which we agree is a tremendous need in the city.",portland

08_29_2018,homeless,"Aren't our taxes already paying for this frickin' crap? How is it that...  a certain percentage of the federal budget goes in to [ORGANIZATION], which runs a [ORGANIZATION], automated fingerprint identification system, should be fully funded by the federal government because God knows us they're not giving enough money to house homeless people. So why is it that we need a regional network, [ORGANIZATION], to gouge us for $20,000 a year  to get fingerprint records that should already be fully funded by the [PERSON], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION].",portland

06_05_2019,housing crisis,"There is, again, no denying that it is impacting and accelerating our housing crisis.

06_05_2019,affordable housing,"If it does not involve careful planning and strong and empowered community engagement like you did in the development process, New investment in infrastructure, public transportation can make surrounding neighborhoods more desirable, raising property values and spurring the conversion of affordable housing to higher end units.

The FAC0 being a tower with affordable housing development adjacent to it, and I'm guessing the FAC0 is more than 250 feet, although I don't have a map.",portland
09_20_2017,houseless,"I get it. I've been punched in the gut by your decision since [ORGANIZATION], DATE1 of your charade as a mayor who ran on a platform to house the houseless and create police transparency. You abused our houseless with your games and injure and kill our community with your cops.",portland
09_20_2017,houseless,"Man, that was cold. You've stolen money, directed specifically to house the houseless. You've allowed sweeps in the houseless instead.",portland
09_20_2017,homeless,"Thank you, sir. Next item, please. Item [DATE], request of [ORGANIZATION] to address council regarding the homeless and tolerance.",portland
09_20_2017,housing crisis,"As this council secures money for transportation, whether from our city's coffers or through your requests for funding from your partners in [ORGANIZATION], you have the opportunity to invest in your state of priorities, safety, livability, climate, and reducing the related cost of housing and mobility. When looking at what [PERSON] secured from its partners in [ORGANIZATION], one would think that we have a $450 million single-location fender-bender crisis in this town. In fact, we have a crisis of transportation deaths, and we have a housing crisis made worse by insufficient transportation options, particularly for those living in East [PERSON].",portland
09_20_2017,affordable housing,I also am very concerned about affordability. I'm concerned about affordable housing and I'm concerned about affordable commercial space. And if we do not make it feasible for  developers and people who are redeveloping their buildings to have incentives to keep the affordability in [STREET] then we're not going to get the affordability that we need both from a residential position and from a commercial space position.,portland
09_20_2017,affordable housing,"Finally, I want to say that freeway expansion has never solved traffic congestion, and we are proud to stand with a broad coalition of community-based organizations and citizens who are asking for removal of the [ORGANIZATION] project from the transportation plan. Well, there might be localized benefits to the project. We believe it would come with a very high opportunity cost and would divert much-needed city dollars from other important initiatives like housing, affordable housing, better transit, and [STREET] improvements in the outer east side of [ORGANIZATION].",portland
09_16_2015,homeless,"But also, I heard these [ORGANIZATION] people say,  are here [ORGANIZATION] to present, you know, more proof on the lawlessness and all the other stuff involved with homeless people, supposedly, you know, as they price everyone out of the city and wage war and gentrification. You know, well, [PERSON]...  is the anniversary of [ORGANIZATION], you know? And I'd like to give a thumbs up to the [ORGANIZATION] and all the other yuppie scum in this city that made the death possible of [ORGANIZATION] by...  you know, being little cop callers that call the police on every little thing.",portland
09_16_2015,homeless,"I see a myriad of problems that plague the area. I want to clarify that I'm not at odds with the homeless. What I'm concerned with is twofold, the deplorable conditions these people live with [ORGANIZATION] and the burden placed upon business owners by allowing these conditions to persist.",portland
09_16_2015,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] has become a magnet for homelessness. With the most lax laws regarding public nuisance behavior and an underfunded police force, we are the destination for homeless travelers, not just on [ORGANIZATION], but in the entire country. We need a two-pronged solution to the problem.",portland
09_16_2015,homeless; homelessness,"They've cut homelessness by over 70% in [ORGANIZATION]. I know budgetary concerns are first and foremost, but it has been proven that getting people off the [STREET] is cheaper than having them be homeless. To conclude, what we need is increased social services, including beds, to get people off the streets immediately.",portland
09_16_2015,homelessness,"I just want to make one comment. You said earlier that we're a magnet, and when [ORGANIZATION] was mayor,  he had a 12-point plan and homelessness. And part of the plan, they addressed this question about whether if the city invested in services and housing for low-income people, we would, in effect, become a magnet, or the critics used to call it the welcome mat phenomenon.",portland
09_16_2015,affordable housing,And so we are striving to site stations near affordable housing and service centers. So thank you very much for sticking with me for all that. I'm obviously very excited about this.,portland

And what I love about PERSON2 is that it's because of his strong principles that he is often someone asking the questions that no one else is willing to ask in [ORGANIZATION].",portland
09_16_2015,affordable housing,"Thank you, Mr. [PERSON]. This is a multi-application, the [ORGANIZATION] tax exemption for building affordable housing. The developer originally planned to do 100% of the units at 60% of median family income.",portland
09_16_2015,affordable housing,"In this instance, we're still well above the 20% floor of affordable housing that we require.

09_16_2015,affordable housing,"And when we have a drop, I didn't even do the math to know exactly how many units we're losing here, but I hope that you will find a [STREET] to empower yourselves to wrangle these people back to the table and tell you what their vision is, how they're going to make up, I mean, not contractually, but just morally, the...  make up for this loss of affordable housing. We thought we were going to get it.",portland
09_16_2015,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION]? I appreciate the discussion, and I do hearken back to [ORGANIZATION]'s work session we had on the cost of affordable housing And, you know, note that one of the issues that came up was how design commission review can increase the cost.",portland
08_05_2020,housing crisis,"And as I mentioned, it's not just the existence of the camp, which generally speaking, we don't have an issue with. We understand that we have a housing crisis. There are a lot of peaceful campers there and they're respectful, but there are some people that maybe are not,  being respectful, and some adjacent activities that have been a result because of it, including drug deals that have been going down in broad daylight [ORGANIZATION] when needles are provided as our cans.",portland
08_05_2020,homelessness,And what we would like is that if the city would be able to come and see the issues for themselves and help facilitate a solution involving all who are impacted because the neighborhood association is not equipped to act as a convener in this multi jurisdictional nightmare  And [ORGANIZATION] has not been helpful. The situation has gotten much worse because we had a double stabbing recently. You probably have seen the reports about that.,portland
08_05_2020,homelessness,"I'm happy to be here and I represent the voices of several people, including myself. I'd like to discuss some of what is being experienced nightly.

I have indicated that I'm a renter, that I have no conflicts of interest.",portland
08_05_2020,affordable housing,"Just to help everybody reoriented on the proposals, the intent of the residential infill,  project amendments is to allow for more housing in different kinds of housing and zones that currently only allow single dwelling units. The project now includes a bonus if you build affordable housing and connects to the historic resources code project update to help guide growth, specifically in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. We heard public testimony in [ORGANIZATION] that  We held two work sessions to more fully develop amendments to the proposed draft of the residential infill project based on the testimony that we heard.",portland
07_15_2015,homeless,"God bless [PERSON] for giving me good health insurance. Otherwise, I'd be back in the hospital and those cars wouldn't be working on the streets.

07_15_2015,homelessness,"I joked to you that I may myself return to homelessness if this  pilot period went through. I think that's a bit more of a reality than it is just me playing with words. It's really bad out there for us, and I'm hoping that you will take the trials and tribulations your full-time taxi drivers are experiencing to heart when you consider continuing an uncapped pilot project such as this.",portland
07_15_2015,homeless,These programs are allowing the officers with [ORGANIZATION] to have a more unique and intimate interaction with the community and tourists who are visiting the downtown core.

07_15_2015,homeless,"DATE0, I looked at the city council hearing and I didn't see anything that I was going to come down and testify on. DATE0 [TIME], all over the media, it was talking about what you're going to do with the property, move a homeless camp into the property. I'll relocate a homeless camp into the property.",portland
07_15_2015,homeless,"I again DATE0 went back and looked at the council agenda, and this seemed to be the connection. PERSON0, again, we're going to hold a hearing in the future if the council moves forward with putting a homeless camp. I understand that.",portland
07_15_2015,homeless,"I was also going to talk about just issues we have with homeless camps. You did link that with the  press releases that went out and so now we're not allowed to testify about it. We feel there hasn't been a process that involved the whole community in terms of bringing in experts,  public planners and the community at large to do a legitimate planning process that's the basis of a lot of our planning so we feel that it's very premature",portland
07_15_2015,houseless,"However, I would like to make some things I observed here. I don't agree in sexist statement that was made earlier against [ORGANIZATION], Commissioner [ORGANIZATION] Fritz. I don't agree with the [STREET] the houseless community was treated when they tried to come in here.",portland
07_15_2015,houseless,"I support the city buying the piece of land. We still, as a board, have to decide where we're going based on the needs of the houseless community. But I would like to echo that every time the houseless community, as we've done, has shown that we can self-organize in a safe manner.",portland
07_15_2015,homeless,"And so I just, it's difficult to come to a hearing and find that people who I think do support Right to Dream 2 haven't come to necessarily ask us our position on this.

07_15_2015,homeless,"One of the things that I always hear as a homeless advocate is why are these empty spaces out there when we have homeless people out on the streets? You know, one of the things we can do is  work together and get some creative minds together of how to utilize these proposed lands. Just in the [TIME] count, which they do [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION], you'll see the numbers of the homeless people out there.",portland
07_15_2015,homeless,"I am also a board member of [ORGANIZATION], and I am obviously in support of buying these properties.

07_11_2018,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm here to speak about some alternatives for the housing situation. And what I'm proposing is something along the lines of these affordable housing units that we have going up now, you know, 500 units or so in a chunk, possibly connected to a vertical garden where these people can raise all the food that they're going to need and more. Associated with a store, they can sell their produce.",portland

11_14_2016,affordable housing,"Go ahead, sit down. My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm here as a developer currently working on FAC0. I support the need for affordable housing, and I understand the need for affordable housing, particularly in the east side.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"We just have a suggestion because for the affordable housing to actually be built, it also needs to be affordable on the builder's side as well. All I'm going to suggest is that, and we've brought examples here, by the [STREET], of affordable housing that is family-oriented with multiple bedrooms that we can build that would actually fall below the standards that have been suggested in terms of square footage, minimum lot size, depth, et cetera. So all we're suggesting is to set aside the mathematical limitations  interpretation of what affordable housing is from a proportion and allow it to be built, allow the developers and the builders to create it.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"at FAC0 and FAC1 simply because it reminds us of the type of character and of the mixture of the neighborhood that we are. There is a lot of affordable housing in [LOCATION] and a lot of it could be torn down if the present plans that we see that have been proposed by both [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], they want to tear down affordable housing. We support affordable housing.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] supports affordable housing. We think there should be a separate ordinance passed by this good body that defines what affordable housing is throughout the city, including FAC0. We would ask though that that be a separate issue, maybe a resolution passed by the council saying within [ORGANIZATION] we will have inclusionary, we will determine what affordable housing is and how it should be done.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,There's talks about providing affordable housing and prevention of demolition. The thing about a zoning code is that it can't be a brush to fix all issues. I urge that the council adopts  plan that speaks to the heart of what it was envisioned.,buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Director of [ORGANIZATION] at ORG0. We are, among many other things, an affordable housing developer.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"So we see [ORGANIZATION] the crisis of affordable housing in this city. Our waiting list for the affordable apartments we develop at this point is close to 400 households. And [ORGANIZATION] people are coming in, filling out applications, wondering what their status is, and telling stories about their being displaced from their neighborhoods.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"So we strongly support inclusionary zoning within the Green Code, and we hope that the final version of the Green Code includes an inclusionary zoning provision. Just to give you an example, the median income of a renter in [ORGANIZATION] is around $22,000. So if you use the standard affordable housing definition of paying no more than 30% of your income in rent, that's a rent of around $600.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"The new development that we're seeing across [ORGANIZATION], and we're in support of new development, but much of that new development is luxury housing with rents of $1,200, $1,800, $2,500. That is not affordable to the vast majority of this city, and in addition, that new development  leads to increases of rents and home prices in the surrounding area, again, furthering displacement and lack of affordable housing in this city. So inclusionary zoning directly goes to mitigating the impact of new development, and we hope it is included in the Green Code so that the new [ORGANIZATION] is an equitable city and provides opportunities for all of us who live here.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,I also support inclusionary zoning. I think we need to be creative in order to ensure that there's affordable housing in our city. I don't think this is appropriate probably for the Green Code.,buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"Secondly, affordable housing. I think [ORGANIZATION] has a chance, and I don't know how this relates to the Green Code, but to get away from a city in which people, because they don't have enough money, are constantly pushed from one area to another, you know, into [ORGANIZATION] because people are moving out of [ORGANIZATION] into [PERSON] and then back into the suburbs because now people are moving into [ORGANIZATION]. We need to get away from that.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"What are we going to do about making more affordable housing? She was crying literally that she had nowhere to go with five kids. We need to step up and actually build more affordable housing, inclusionary zoning, so that people can actually have a [STREET] to live that is actually nice.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] can't create the amount of affordable housing that we need. We actually are trying with ORG1 doing solar panels and trying to invest into our city. But this should be happening throughout the whole entire city.,buffalo

11_14_2016,affordable housing,"I think our city government has a great opportunity to make a very progressive move in adding inclusionary zoning to the green code. What it will do is secure affordable housing for the people who live in this city. I want to give a shout out to my council person, [ORGANIZATION], who has taken the information that we've provided  and has seriously considered how this could benefit our community.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"It's green only in the sense that it addresses density and walkability, but even there, state-funded, developer-driven density without affordable housing is the exact same thing as the builder and car-centric driven density. suburban development that our planners demonized [ORGANIZATION].

11_14_2016,affordable housing,"But since we are not [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] or [ORGANIZATION], we don't have to think about or worry about that yet. Further, when asked if he could name a fair price for affordable housing in the city, he didn't have an answer. Secondly, I'd like to, in a meeting in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] made a statement that during [ORGANIZATION] we saw some of the most vibrant communities in American history.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"And also, are they building these developments that would include affordable housing? Okay, that's another thing that we got to look at and we're saying in the community should be about 30% of The residents there should be low income residents. Okay.",buffalo
11_14_2016,affordable housing,"First of all, I have worked for [ORGANIZATION]. I was a fellow for [ORGANIZATION], and I have a startup whose application to the ORG2 is pending in order to provide affordable housing. I'd just like to make one thing clear.",buffalo
10_31_2023,affordable housing,So what we have here and and the question that was asked to me at a community meeting was this is a residential neighborhood Where are the residents? so we know that through [ORGANIZATION] who has an application to go through all the listings on [ORGANIZATION] and then a Go back to their records to see which ones are verified and which ones are registered with the city There are potentially almost two thousand unregistered [ORGANIZATION] owner occupied rentals in my district and so anybody on ORG2 that fights for affordable housing,buffalo
12_12_2019,affordable housing,These changes from the original application include and I want to read this because I want people to know exactly what some of the benefits are that we have not mentioned up to this point. One prohibiting front yard parking. Greater setback protections for neighborhood properties to ensure that any new buildings are not towering over adjacent neighbors Most importantly the revised [ORGANIZATION] includes standards for affordable housing and green space Thankfully the current developer has agreed to providing affordable housing and green space but by including this standards in the [ORGANIZATION] This ensures that those standards are written into law and will need to be complied with regardless of who owns the property.,buffalo
12_12_2019,affordable housing,"Because this project will be going to [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing tax credits, they must receive all city approvals before [ORGANIZATION], before [LOCATION], when their application is due to the state. That is why we need to call a special session DATE2 to reconsider this item immediately. And people would ask, well, why are you doing it immediately?",buffalo
12_12_2019,affordable housing,"Thank you, sir Just one question you talked about the affordable housing it will regardless of who with this move regardless of who owns it that that stays that's that's correct regardless of who owns the property we put it into the law that it will remain the same with green space we want to make sure that this green space is permanent that another developer comes and says we're going to build on the green space they can't do it we included those safeguards because the community wanted it and that's why we have the amendments all right thank you very much motion to adjourn second by councilman [PERSON] yeah we approved as amended",buffalo

And our last addition to the ordinance is the functional language making it unlawful to possess an open container or consume alcohol within 1,000 feet of a [INSTITUTION] outside of [ORGANIZATION] on public streets, alleys, sidewalks, or pedestrian ways.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"The addresses of the shelters listed were received through [ORGANIZATION] and may not encompass all shelters throughout the city due to some confidential locations for vulnerable populations. An example of this would be [ORGANIZATION]. If the IT can click on the hyperlink, we can show you a list of the, from the homeless coalition.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,The maps that were showing afterwards that would be the inclusion into the current ordinance that would add the definition of homeless shelters and enforcement under the homeless shelters within a thousand feet. So this would this would add additional areas outside of the central business zone? That is correct sir.,el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"This comes to us through the TAVC code, sections 109.35 and 109.36. Those two statutes give cities the ability to regulate open container consumption of alcohol in those specific places pointed out, the central business districts of the cities  within 1,000 feet of homeless shelters or substance abuse treatment centers. And as you also saw it foreclosed, there's a possibility of implementing other regulation on open container.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"And this is probably another obvious question, but this would not discriminate between somebody carrying an open container that would either be a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,  somebody that would be at a [INSTITUTION] or a resident that would live a block or across the [STREET] from a [INSTITUTION] that had an open container it would not discriminate anybody that had an open container could would commit an offense with this. That's correct. There would be no difference between a local resident and  who would be in violation of this ordinance and a person who's utilizing a [INSTITUTION].",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"They were getting a lot of traffic from homeless in those surrounding areas and so this came as a result of trying to do something responsive to their concerns. Okay. And then the Chiefs are, are y'all seeing something similar in terms of some of some of these disruptions in the neighborhoods arriving these areas from your officers?",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"Yes, sir. We're data driven. So one of the difficult things for us to present a council was the fact that  Historically, we don't capture that information on open containers near homeless shelters because it is not currently in the fence at the time.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"But the data and some of the calls for service pointed towards that and we feel that this would definitely help in protecting everyone. And to be clear, the open container amendment is not targeting the homeless. It actually protects everyone, citizens, neighborhoods, homes.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"homeless shelters, the employees, and the homeless themselves who are vulnerable at times. Okay. Well, I think that kind of rounds out the question.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"I mean, when this discussion first was had, remember when it was brought up before, the biggest thing that struck me was the fact that  in essence outside of the central business area and if these proposed areas around these homeless centers, so pretty much it's legal within the city of [ORGANIZATION] to have an open container on any sidewalk or public [STREET]. And I was not aware of that at all and I know that there is issues or concerns about behavior related towards alcohol consumption but the fact that state law legalizes and allows for  that state law allows open container on city streets, whether that's on FAC0 or FAC1 or FAC2 is very surprising and a little bit troubling, but that's what state law is, is that correct, Chief?",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"I think that if we could really just blanket the whole city with this policy, I would have no issue with it. But I don't know why we are asking [ORGANIZATION] to essentially patrol  homeless shelters. Substance abuse, addiction are very real things that our homeless community deals with.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"But when someone calls my office and says, there's a homeless individual living in our alley, we don't call [ORGANIZATION], we call ORG1 or another organization that can help. And I really wish that that had been the solution here. And I have a lot of heartburn about doing this.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"I think that the comment was it's up to a $500 fine for drinking outside of a [INSTITUTION]. So we're just going to be constantly finding individuals in these shelters that can't afford these fines until they're placed in jail. I mean, I don't understand how that's helping the community, but I know that we do have public comment, correct, Ms. [PERSON]?",el paso
10_12_2021,homelessness,"And then also the shelters that we spoke to were also in favor of this. So we have, you know, spent a tremendous amount of time, especially since the start of the pandemic, addressing homelessness and expanding both the services we offer and the partnerships we have with the other providers. And like you were saying, Representative PERSON0, we do call those providers if there is a problem.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Deputy Director for [ORGANIZATION]. And I do want to point out a couple things.,el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"It comes with a $500 fine. As you work with the homeless, you're working with individuals that don't have the ability to pay the fine, and if there is a slim chance that they do, I'm just going to be quite blunt, they have no desire to pay the fine. Okay.",el paso
10_12_2021,homelessness,And so we don't want to create a cycle of homelessness as it relates to in and out of the county jail as an example. And I would like to suggest that we have some significant discussions with regard to the approach that we take. It could be modeled for example after the [ORGANIZATION] program and the reason I bring the [ORGANIZATION] program up to the forefront is it's focused on those that have a significant mental health diagnosis.,el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"I mean, to me, you're targeting the homeless population. I mean, it's one, somebody got beat up. Two, you're putting out restrictions.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,And the other one that I'm going to talk in a few is going to be public transportation. You do not provide public transportation to the homeless population on [ORGANIZATION]. So that's three arguments that I have.,el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"oh they have an open container is this person a resident or are they homeless before they make a decision you'll get sued for that and this ordinance  crafted to single out those who are homeless you have made exceptions for everybody else but if you're homeless you're gonna pay and then you're gonna have this unending [STREET] between somebody who's an alcoholic and is drinking going to jail spending time in jail come back is homeless drinking back in jail back and forth back and forth the cycle is not broken you take up time with police  [STREET] time, paying for people in jail, possible injuries to our officers.",el paso
10_12_2021,homelessness,This is not a solution. This only perpetrates the homelessness that we have in this community. And you are targeting.,el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"You're going to get hit with...  lawsuits for profiling and discrimination because you have singled out a portion of our population for special enforcement and they're going to nail you to the wall the only good thing coming out of that is they won't be homeless anymore they'll have a lot of money to live on i ask that you rethink this postpone it go back and look at the issue maybe you can find something that will actually work  incarceration of the homeless never works it hasn't worked it's not going to work you got to be smarter than the rock you're trying to break so please postpone this and rethink it thank you that concludes public comment on this item mayor thank you we have represent milliner Thank You mayor chief is out owed right now currently do you know if  [ORGANIZATION] is accepting Class C violations like someone has [DATE] or outstanding traffic tickets Business  It's been currently in effect and also when we look at this ordinance in regard to the health and food buffer and all, one of the things we need to keep in mind, and I stated earlier, it's not targeting the homeless individuals. It's protecting the neighborhood, homeless shelters, the homeless individuals because they can be vulnerable. Alcohol is not allowed in homeless shelters.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"If we address it at that point, no one's talking about picking up individuals and incarcerating them. They have the opportunity in a,  courtroom to state their case as well. So again, it's to protect everyone to include the homeless.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"I just have a couple of questions. You mentioned, is this just to blanket homeless or you said the general public? The general public representative.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"So basically it's not gonna impact anyone living on their private property or their backyard as such. This is only for the alleys, the streets and the sidewalks. Again, to make sure that this is understood clearly,  It will address anyone in the area and not just the homeless.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"Actually, it protects the homeless, like I stated earlier. They're vulnerable. They also need help.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"So by not being allowed, obviously, for obvious reasons into a [INSTITUTION] with alcohol, sometimes you're exploited on the outside part of the areas. And I think this is something that will assist them as well. Okay, thank you.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"And although we all have training in mental health and such, this would have to be something that would have to be explored. I wouldn't be in the position to say we could go administrative on it from the beginning or make references on it. Because again, it's not just gonna be the homeless that are out there that are gonna be receiving or being addressed in regards to this ordinance.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"It's gonna be other individuals that come into the area as well to familiar territory and exploiting on the homeless. Okay, thank you. You're welcome.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,Would there be any any again? Help me understand I guess the process from operations relating to PD if there was a call-in for inebriated person near a [INSTITUTION] or some of these institutions Would there be a decision made to send out a see it [ORGANIZATION] crew? [ORGANIZATION] crew sorry  Or would a [ORGANIZATION] unit or would it be whatever officer was available?,el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,And that would be that would be a monetary cost or that would be jail time? Like Mr. [PERSON] mentioned earlier sir it would be up to a $[ADDRESS] that would determine the additional steps after that. And that $500 would be whether or not it was somebody that was having an open container outside their own home across from a [INSTITUTION] or somebody who was homeless themselves.,el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,So then a warrant would be added. And that's outside of law control as prosecutors and outside of law enforcement's control as well. So that would be a burden for a homeless person.,el paso
10_12_2021,unhoused,"While we know that a large population of our unhoused individuals do have mental  issues with mental health, have been diagnosed with mental health, if they are not in crisis, the ORG0 team is not appropriate for them. And so, and I'm not trying to attack, I'm just trying to clarify, right? So if someone is unhoused, they're at a shelter, they're drinking, they're not necessarily in crisis.",el paso
10_12_2021,homelessness,"We would immediately contact the folks at [ORGANIZATION], typically at the ORG1 site, and they would deploy someone trained  to have a conversation with someone experiencing homelessness about what services were available and make that sort of offer to them to intervene prior to it becoming a law enforcement issue. And so we saw a lot of success with that. We're continuing to see some success with that.",el paso
10_12_2021,unhoused,"So I just, I said that I know that the county has a [ORGANIZATION] program, which is to help with recidivism, I can't say that word, recidivism, with mainly unhoused or people in mental health crisis. And I don't know if the municipal [STREET] has a program like that at all. Recidivism?",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"I know that we've been working with [ORGANIZATION] to put together a homeless coalition as part of the mental health coalition. I think that they're  there could be a better program out there. And I know that, again, Representative PERSON0, your constituents are frustrated and they want something resolved, but I don't feel comfortable supporting something out of kind of fear and anger and not out of the benefit for this community.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless; unhoused,"Thank you Mayor [PERSON]. So I don't have any questions for for staff but I do wanted to share the perspective from our district and the constituents who reached out to our office. I'm in support of this policy change, primarily because the constituents, not only constituents, but businesses, have been drastically affected by not only persons who are unhoused, but persons who live in close proximity to [INSTITUTION].",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"So some of the concerns our office has heard are persons sleeping on benches who are enumerated  whether or not we cannot determine whether or not they are homeless. So what I like about this policy is that it's going to give a violation to any person, regardless of sex, gender, so it's non-discriminatory, in my opinion. However, persons who are drinking are drinking outside on public right-of-ways.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"And our office, as well as [ORGANIZATION] offices, have been working with [ORGANIZATION], been working with residents to report those complaints. So again, I agree that this should not just be a policy where we respond, incarcerate, and give citations, but also to put together...  I don't know, [ORGANIZATION] program so that we can work with homeless organizations, with our community development folks, and with police, as well as our prosecutors, so that we can come up with an approach, a program. This policy is only going to help identify, help officers to identify when there is a problem on the [STREET].",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"It's gonna require [ORGANIZATION] to respond, which they're already doing. [ORGANIZATION]'s already responding, ORG1 offices are already responding. And they will tell you that not all of those persons are homeless.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"A lot of those persons are the same people who are not allowed to go back into their home, and they're forced to go to the [STREET] to drink because their families have essentially abandoned them. And so the problem is more than just homeless, which is why I wanted to advocate for a citywide mandate. But at this point in time, I think a pilot program is appropriate.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"I commit to continuing to work with the community of providers to add more alternative Non-punitive measures to the response and possibly bringing back amendments in the near future in [ORGANIZATION] We have created non police [STREET] outreach teams in partnership with other providers and they now provide the initial response to calls about the homeless and  That program is working great. I hope that this conversation shows that my colleagues are willing to increase the funding for expanded [STREET] outreach. For now, this ordinance change provides an additional tool in the more complicated cases that the [STREET] outreach teams are now not able to address.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"I would hate for a policy change that has the support of residents, neighborhoods, the business community, the police, and the homeless shelters themselves,  It is rare to have everyone on board die here because of opposition from colleagues who were not involved in crafting it. Thank you, Mayor [PERSON]. Is there anybody else that has any other comments?",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"So, okay, well, I have, it's still a, what? Anyways, I do have a concern that even though it's not discriminatory in practice, it basically sends out a net that would,  affect anybody within the buffer area of a [INSTITUTION] most homeless shelters and other institutions like that are located in some of those vulnerable and disenfranchised communities and neighborhoods that we have in our city the kind of neighborhoods and the kind of places where having a misdemeanor on there for outside drinking would not be something that would be easily attainable to hire a lawyer or to pay off  Um, and so I have some concerns. I also recognize, too,  the the concerns from the neighborhood and neighborhood associations as well i too agree with you represent representatives it would be great to have more members of this council be involved in crafting this i think your office was made aware of it",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"Yes, sir. One thing I'd like to point out, but there's, I believe it was Lieutenant [PERSON] mentioned that there was a list of different homeless shelters. However, that information is not in the backup.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"That's correct. To give us the time to get all the backup data  Also too, I don't know if staff can brief us individually, but I also want to understand more in terms of the state statute that states clearly the ability, because I do agree with Representative PERSON0, [PERSON], alternate mayor [PERSON], that really I think what would be beneficial is a much more blanket open container law. I don't think that, you  anybody whether they're within a thousand feet of the [INSTITUTION] or living in any part of the city really has the need to Walk around with an open container.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"You see my card. If I put a basket, everybody tends to confuse this thing as a homeless card. And that is the reason I'm picky about it.",el paso
10_12_2021,homeless,"So when they see this, they assume this is a homeless card. So I get profiled. So, this is an oriental guy that owns the [STREET].",el paso
05_25_2021,homeless,"We have had overflow operations for [ORGANIZATION]. We actually have set up some of our sites for food distribution, including FAC0, which is now the [ORGANIZATION] distribution site for [ORGANIZATION] fighting hunger.

Because of my experience with that same department, I would like to ask, since these funds are going to help homeless individuals and so forth, is there a list of individuals in the funds that have gone out that any member of the citizenry,  can go ahead and make an open records request to get that list so that there's a full accounting as to where all these funds are going.",el paso

12_15_2020,affordable housing,"Okay, so I really just wanted to share a little bit of my thoughts on this. I think, like you mentioned, whoever did apply, we don't want to lose those dollars to be invested in providing housing, or affordable housing, actually, in those areas.

That's, I believe it's already been addressed, but it seems to be there's still the accumulation of whatever the residuals were from those people there, and it still needs to be cleaned up.",el paso
05_24_2022,homeless,"And probably, I believe this is part of the 10-100 block of FAC0 where the people just discarded whatever they had outside of where they were living.

02_01_2022,affordable housing,"What the new proposal is for that northern third of the property, at the time that council gave resolutions of support for FAC0,  Part of that support was predicated on the evaluation score, which also received a higher score because this property was presented as being future light residential commercial development that would serve both the surrounding neighborhoods as well as [ORGANIZATION]  and would serve to sort of bring those residents together. At this time, it appears that that will not be happening and instead is targeted to be development for 40 affordable housing units for seniors.

As a result of these changes, over [ORGANIZATION] we have gotten significantly better project proposals  And we have ultimately chosen to support some great projects that have added high quality, affordable housing stock in our beautiful city. The stark contrast against these quality project proposals from [LOCATION] is why I frankly am disappointed with the proposals that we have received DATE2.",el paso
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"I know staff's recommendation is to provide no support for any of these proposals. While I do feel some reluctance to possibly lose these affordable housing dollars to outside of the city, I keep returning to the thought that we need quantity of units, but we also need quality. And it would feel like a disservice to give my support to proposals that score an F on our scorecard because they don't adequately provide for the future residents who would live there.",el paso
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"And so one of my concerns is looking at the condition and looking at what are the goals or some of the goals of  of our initiative our policy right and that is to go in and have these affordable housing developments that can be close that can ideally be within an interior of our city or at least they're not directly in the interior of our city be in an area that's close to education commercial or mass my concern is that by taking a very  whether it's an appropriate or not, but a very aggressive stance towards not giving any numbers or not giving any support, is that we're gonna essentially push these developments or the opportunity for developments in our community as a whole  out into the county into areas that have less access towards mass transit, less access towards education, and less access towards job sites as well.",el paso
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"To go and develop in some of these areas in other parts of our cities that may not necessarily be within the sort of inner core, we're looking at a price maybe $4, $3, $4, $5 a square foot versus something like [ORGANIZATION], which is in [ORGANIZATION], which is probably closer to $20 a square foot. These are costs that a developer has to incur and factor in. And if we're going to be committed towards this vision of wanting to have affordable housing towards it, then we need to also have a conversation.",el paso
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"And  towards this wanting to see infill development and wanting to see these kind of affordable housing projects we need to be addressing that as well. My big concern here is with the staff's recommendation is that essentially we're going to be rewarding sprawl because if we don't go and give any numbers to this whether it's a resolution of support or otherwise we're going to be going essentially and not getting any support  If so facto, we're going to be encouraging these developments to occur in our county, which absolutely has less access to mass transit, educational and retail and job opportunities for our community. And so I'm not sure I can support staff suggestions [ORGANIZATION].",el paso
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"And so the thing is that it's not like they were not aware. It's not like staff hadn't,  [ORGANIZATION] had made these regulations part of the deal in our vote so the main thing to say was that definitely public transportation some of those people that live in affordable housing don't have cars they don't have families that can go pick them up they don't have they either have to walk to their destination or take public transportation as you saw none of these projects had anywhere near the public public transportation that's much needed to  I feel that we weren't the city wasn't provided with any really viable project to vote on and I I'm really disappointed that because I didn't expect that from from the competitors the applicants",el paso

They're the service provider for the citizens and they carry out a lot of the state's  mission and work right here at the local level that y'all do in providing these services and so the more we can have that discussion the more that we can kind of keep the dialogue and policy debate in that while pursuing those things that y'all want to is where we have the best chance in this environment it's not where  the old days where cities large cities would come in and say these are the agenda items we'd like to see highlighted or considered and we get our [STREET] with that that that's not the the reality of the legislative environment that we operate in anymore sharing your your agenda item early as you have with your delegation and identifying which community partners  an active on those topics is very important we tend to have a much better success on whether it's proactive issues or getting change to issues that we might have opposed proposals if we have support outside of just government",el paso

09_12_2023,homelessness,"Thank you. And the [STREET] my life has changed and the contrast between [ORGANIZATION] and where I was at is an absolutely, it's a beautiful thing. I'm a person who's experienced incarceration, homelessness.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"We trust that these resources in your hands will stretch even further than we could hope. May the homeless find shelter, the sick find hope for healing, the vulnerable be protected, the lonely be visited. Let the hungry eat and the mourning find joy.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"I'll cover that in a short time. But we also looked at the position of an open container or an alcoholic beverage within a public [STREET], public alley or a public sidewalk. And the option we have here is having an amendment to our ordinance within 1,000 feet of the property line of a [INSTITUTION] that is not in [ORGANIZATION].",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"For [ORGANIZATION], we've had a total of 505. And the reason we want to talk about this is this is basically what would be applicable in the areas we're talking about, the homeless shelters. Next slide, please.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"So what we did as a team along with the city attorney's office, we looked at the definition of the [INSTITUTION] and it's taken directly from the [ORGANIZATION] section. And it basically means that it's a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter or other facility that is designed to provide temporary living accommodations to individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate residence. So,  The amendment to the ordinance would be applicable from the boundary lines within 1,000 feet of the property line for any [INSTITUTION] that's not located within [ORGANIZATION].",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"A violation under this ordinance would be a classy misdemeanor, plus initial bill of $2,500. So basically what we've been doing as a team is we've been reaching out to [ORGANIZATION] and looking at other areas as well. Basically, one of the things we want to show, if we could go to the next slide, please, is calls for service.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"Now, keep in mind that the city of [ORGANIZATION], particularly [ORGANIZATION], only has statistics where this ordinance is currently enforced, which is the central business district. So we wanted to look out, reach out to the areas we're looking at to see if the data supports this. And we've used here as an example, and there's no intent here to...  to target the homeless or anyone.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"We feel that  [ORGANIZATION] slide, please. We feel that by having this tool, it's not just protecting individuals in the area, the residents, the shelter, but it also protects the vulnerable individuals, those that are homeless, from being enticed to any other criminal activity that can be occurring. We feel it's our duty to also protect everyone, including the homeless.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"And what we're doing with our fusion centers, we're mapping out the locations that we have identified as homeless shelters per the definition. And as we progress on it, we're going to bring all this back to you. DATE0 for the first hearing and discuss it further as to the implementation on the ordinance.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"But again, every situation is a little different based on their proximity to include churches as well. So there's numerous layers out there to enforce it. What we're doing on this ordinance is taking that to other areas where we feel it'll help the community and not just the residents, but the homeless population as well.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,Well this is a public meeting right so that is you learn something [ORGANIZATION] The only time the city as an incorporated city can go in there with the layers we've added like the central business district or hopefully with the [INSTITUTION] when it's an option given to us through the state under [ORGANIZATION].,el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"So I would go and make a suggestion that in addition to this alcohol-free zone and areas identified relating to  relating to the homeless shelters. I also would think it would make sense for staff to look at an additional area relating to the university,  [ORGANIZATION] current [STREET] area as well. You do have a lot of events that are going on around the university.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"Maybe putting some provisions that you can't sell  you know, alcohol near schools, new churches, new daycare facilities, maybe near homeless shelters, adult and foster care locations. So there's a number of things that I would also like for you all to review as we're putting these comprehensive policies in [STREET]. Thank you.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"The next speaker is Ms. [PERSON]. Her topic is [ORGANIZATION]. Good [TIME], ma'am.",el paso
09_14_2021,homelessness,"Okay. Good [TIME], Mayor, [ORGANIZATION], City Manager. DATE0, I emailed each of you a letter requesting that grants provided to the coalition and approved by council on DATE1 be reinstated to reflect the original scope of work and related deliverables that support the network of provider agencies serving those experiencing homelessness.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless; homelessness,"That letter was endorsed by numerous member agencies of the [ORGANIZATION] that value our work and recognize the contribution we provide to [ORGANIZATION] and the entire region in addressing homelessness. I wanted to speak [ORGANIZATION] to provide some context regarding this request and the consequences of eliminating or reducing funding. Since DATE1, the [ORGANIZATION] supported the [ORGANIZATION] through a planning grant, enabling us to provide intensive training and technical assistance to agencies working directly with the homeless, supporting our work in addressing chronic homelessness and homelessness among veterans, youth, and families.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"This grant has been completely eliminated as [ORGANIZATION] incorporated deliverables that were outside of the scope of funding and department leadership was not agreeable to negotiate what was realistic and feasible. In [ORGANIZATION], the city decided to support the coalition's homeless management information system, enabling us to provide ORG1 services of training, technical assistance, and health desk support for recipients of the city's [ORGANIZATION] program and further allowed us to offset fees paid to the ORG1 vendor so we could essentially provide free ORG1 services to homeless assistance providers. This grant is currently in jeopardy as deliverables were recently added to the agreement that are not only outside the scope of the funding source, but that we don't have the funding or capacity to address.",el paso
09_14_2021,homeless,"These deliverables are burdensome on the coalition and will essentially pull our efforts away from the agencies that we are here to support. As the infrastructure planning entity and [ORGANIZATION] administrator for [ORGANIZATION] continuum of care, we are federally mandated to provide these services that were supported by these city grants. So the loss of funding won't fundamentally affect the coalition, but will financially impact the agencies providing direct services to the homeless.",el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"I am here to present you [ORGANIZATION] a management update in our efforts associated with multifamily affordable housing. I think this is something very, very exciting because this is a plan that represents an unprecedented local investment in our community in terms of the affordable housing units in production, what we're seeking to do in the future, and most importantly, how we're seeking...  to address the affordable housing challenges in our community. Next slide.",el paso
11_07_2023,homelessness,"Obviously we have, and you guys have seen this recently, the adoption of climate sustainability. I think it makes perfect sense in terms of the work that we do for mitigation and adaptation for climate, but also  Overseeing civic empowerment, that is our volunteerism efforts, equity, access, we talked about those things. After that we have human services, right, with the task of overseeing our homelessness efforts.",el paso
11_07_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,"I think this is something that's very important, particularly as we transition out of the pandemic, to look at the work that we've done in terms of ensuring that folks stay out of homelessness,  And finally, the reason that I'm here, our neighborhood development, which is overseeing our affordable housing efforts. Very, very important that we give you this update because we're very excited to essentially let y'all know that  From our position, we know that homelessness is a housing problem. From our position, we know that investing in stable and affordable housing, along with support services, of course, is critical to the solution to ending homelessness.",el paso
11_07_2023,homelessness,"And of course, we understand and we coordinate very well with our sister departments how high cost and low wages can push families into homelessness that only places then a higher strength in our support systems. Of course you can read there our motto if you will. I'm not going to read it but if you want to take a look at it I think it's something that really captures what we do very well with community development.",el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"So basically to give you a little bit of background we released a notice of funding availability [ORGANIZATION] where we've asked developers to come back to us with affordable housing deals within our sale limits. But one of the things we learned from this council and obviously from executive leadership is to make sure that we are actually pushing them to maximize the purchasing power of those sellers. Meaning to make sure that they're actually not just utilizing our funds, our [ORGANIZATION] funds, which is [ORGANIZATION], but also ensuring that they're leveraging their funds with their private investment.",el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,So a deal that is perhaps maybe $10 million could maybe be a deal that it's $20 million and really increase the...  production of affordable housing units and rehab those affordable housing units in our community. So we follow that model. We push that model.,el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,You make sure that there's also private money to make sure that you increase the affordable housing units. So we were very pleased that we put out $19.2 million of our funds. And what we got back from the developers was a total investment of $50 million.,el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"So we're talking about, in essence, an investment that will produce 258 affordable housing units. That's huge. That's never happened in our community in terms of a deal this size.",el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"Normally speaking...  We put deals like this, we put deals associated with federal funds, and then the developers only use those funds to produce these affordable housing units. This is something that it's a best model, it's a best practice, while frankly it's a model also that if you look at the inflationary markets that we're seeing, it's only relevant to address this issue. One of the things I wanted to spend time to talking to you folks about this is, of course, looking at some of the data, right?",el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"So we took this data, we digested this data, and we realized that of course, a reduction in bank injury rates means fewer affordable housing units, it means increased competition among tenants, right? More tenants, right?  higher rental costs, and then ultimately limiting the access to affordable housing units from our limited income clients. So this deal is exactly addressing that.",el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"We're very excited about that. One of the things that we are looking at is adopting this model for future deals, ensuring that we're releasing these funds in a [STREET] that folks don't just rely on city funds, bathroom funds, that is, from the [ORGANIZATION], to build affordable housing in our community. With that, I will take any questions y'all may have.  representative followed by representative thank you mr mayor first and foremost i want to thank you and miss [PERSON] for your uh your um briefing it was very informative",el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"but i really want to congratulate you and your team and the whole group for thinking outside the box and and bringing more affordable housing to our community it's thinking like that that's going to make us  really, really accessible and affordable for people in that market. So thank you, thank you for your support. Thank you, now we have Mayor Pro Tem then Representative PERSON0.",el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"so i i know that we have all met with [ORGANIZATION] before i thank you for that and just encouraging you to continue building that relationship in the future thank you ma'am [ORGANIZATION]  thank you mayor um yeah thank you for the update uh and for your work and miss [PERSON]'s work and all of your team's work um on this very important investment in these uh affordable housing units for for the city um you know as i've said before on a couple of different items that have come before us in [DATE] this isn't just about providing shelter  It's about strengthening the entire community, promoting equity, and making sure that we improve the quality of life for everybody, helping the most vulnerable [ORGANIZATION] lift everybody up. So as we heard in the presentation, it's about a $19.2 million investment of our home funds and our CDBG funds through the revolving loan program, revolving loan fund program.",el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"258 affordable units is huge. As you said, it's like a really unprecedented investment for us. Again I just want to emphasize affordable housing, it provides stability for families.",el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"Good morning, everyone, or [TIME] already. [TIME]. I'm really excited about this opportunity I think it's going to make significant impact to [ORGANIZATION]ans all across the city [ORGANIZATION] the city of [ORGANIZATION] was recognized by as an all-American city because of our focus on helping affordable housing in our community and so we can't forget where we're at and the progress that we have [PERSON] I am a product",el paso
11_07_2023,affordable housing,and I know other members of [ORGANIZATION] are the product of affordable housing when  children and families the same opportunity to every other family then there is a direct impact not only to the economy but our social responsibility to care for others and so this is going to be Really impactful but as representative [ORGANIZATION] said we got to move the needle I would challenge you all and I know you have really great ideas and  to find really eloquent responses like you presented [ORGANIZATION] on increasing that number because too many families unfortunately cannot afford their rent and big families are living in apartments. And so many thanks and congratulations to all of the folks who would get this benefit and we are counting on those developers to provide.  really nice rehabilitation in communities for all of our families I do have a question related to compliance we have in the past we have looked at [ORGANIZATION] levels or is there a benchmark or is there a requirement to serve the lowest income families with this or is it going to be the state standards which is I don't believe is,el paso
11_07_2023,homelessness,Right. So the lowest am eyes the folks that are struggling to stay out of homelessness. Right.,el paso
11_07_2023,homeless,"Okay, now I have my actual questions, y'all. Similar to Representative PERSON0, I'm looking at, I think they're upwards of 2,000 well I'll just say wanting to understand a little bit more about the contracts that are going out you know interested in how they are different [ORGANIZATION] for homeless versus the housing opportunity management",el paso
11_07_2023,homelessness,"However, we feel that the $500 that was discussed would not be an issue as far as eligibility if the [ORGANIZATION] was to be dedicated or allocated towards this particular program and So again, we did look at a couple of different sources. We looked at the economic development funding that the city currently has although there is available funding currently the [STREET] that or what was discussed at the [ORGANIZATION] council meeting was that particular program would not fall within the impact fund or within the ORG1 policy Which has been approved by ORG2 We looked at the CDBG funding  Unfortunately, [LOCATION] notice of funding availability won't go out until DATE2 and this particular group that was mentioned at that [ORGANIZATION] meeting Would be eligible to apply to submit a proposal for That particular program and then finally as I mentioned looking at [ORGANIZATION] in which there was twelve million dollars that was approved by ORG2 towards the community development and  particularly related to the community recovery and so a couple of different items that were addressed and that presentation back in [LOCATION] which i sent to you all back on again that [PERSON] meeting so you've seen that presentation but particularly related to housing homelessness household stability and food stability so we feel that that would be probably the best use if there would be a reallocation of that funding that was approved back in [LOCATION] of [DATE] and so with that i'm going to turn it over to mr [ORGANIZATION] who will get a little bit more detail about the recommendation  thank you [ORGANIZATION] climate and sustainability officer for the record so as [ORGANIZATION] was mentioning our ultimate recommendation is going to be to reallocate funds from the existing [ORGANIZATION] allocation for community recovery and also as he mentioned  The reason community recovery is because the direction from ORG3 in that particular pot allocated to community and human development was targeted at addressing the most vulnerable in our community.",el paso
11_07_2023,homelessness,"And so when we take a look at what community recovery means to us, what vulnerability means to us as an organization and as a community,  a group of servant leaders in this community we are looking at the data that we've gathered over [ORGANIZATION] in the most recent community needs assessment we saw a very similar outcome in terms of the areas of need things like food security  resident empowerment, mental health, and addressing homelessness. As you all heard my assistant director, [ORGANIZATION] talk about earlier, you know, we're investing in multi-family housing, we're investing in human services that address the needs of those at risk of homelessness, but actual homelessness is also an extraordinary priority in this community. So those are the things that you all directed us to look at when we created the community recovery pot of [ORGANIZATION] funds.",el paso
11_07_2023,homelessness,"Our recommendation at this point for this particular item for the cash assistance program would be to issue a notice of funding availability, which would address the process component of the council direction from the meeting [ORGANIZATION], so that we would solicit a nonprofit organization that could provide any service in alignment with the results of the most recent community needs assessment, as I've just described it,  with the metrics and standard as required by law and by ARPA regulation. That goes back a little bit to the slide and I'm happy to go back and talk a little more about ARPA regulation in terms of these types of programs, but we would want to make sure that that notice of funding availability was very, very clear  With the applicants with the sub recipient applicants about what the rules would be What kind of documentation we would be requiring so that again not only are we issuing? assistance through our sub recipients to this community in need, but we are also [LOCATION] the investments of the city of [ORGANIZATION] and ultimately of the taxpayers at [DATE] however, what I can tell you is that  out of the community needs assessment for [LOCATION], and just the experience that we've had on the ground with all of our nonprofit service organizations, is that the priority in our community right now is folks that are at risk of eviction or at risk of homelessness.",el paso
11_07_2023,homelessness,"yeah I just have a  A couple of questions. I noticed that the scope changed from the initial item, which was risk of eviction preventing homelessness and the new one [ORGANIZATION] says negative impact due to the pandemic.",el paso
11_07_2023,housing insecurity,"Here we go. Recipients may presume that low and moderate income households as defined in the final rule as well as households below.  that experienced unemployment, food insecurity, or housing insecurity did in fact experience a negative economic impact due to the pandemic. And so there's just that federal regulatory structure.",el paso
11_07_2023,homeless,"So let me make sure that I'm very, very clear. The question that I was answering was a similar type of program that we have operated through a subrecipient in the past is our rapid rehousing program. A rapid rehousing program places a family into an apartment unit before they become homeless and pays their rent for a certain period of time.",el paso
11_07_2023,homeless,"You all saw me here at the podium many times with [ORGANIZATION]. Folks like [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], ORG2.  others that really provided a direct service to the community but there is no physical [STREET] currently where that can be provided in in one location so the imagining of the community resilience center or community resilience hub  was a single [STREET] where [ORGANIZATION] could go in time of crisis to access services. That's how it was imagined.",el paso
11_07_2023,homelessness,There was a number of things that made that possible.  really difficult for a cash assistance program. Another example that we used during the budget process was the veteran homelessness program. The veteran homelessness program that we operated under the general fund in past cycles and we're not doing going forward is not appropriate for our other federal funding sources.,el paso
11_07_2023,homelessness,"Those kinds of things. Once they pass through that part of the process, it goes to the technical advisory, which,  are typically selected from nonprofit service providers in that space, in this sort of, whether it's mental health, homelessness, housing, in that space that are not also competing for those funds. We select from those groups, and they score the applications, and that's part of what we base our recommendation on to you all.",el paso
11_07_2023,homelessness,"There you go. Second by Representative PERSON0. And just to make sure this is the motion, and correct me if I'm wrong, it is to approve the staff's recommendation to reallocate funds from existing ORG0 community recovery and issue a notice of a funding availability competitive process soliciting a nonprofit organization to assist those at risk of eviction and prevent homelessness.",el paso
02_15_2022,homeless,"We've done 670 property cleanups, 19 illegal dumping cases, 10 homeless camps.  nearly 3,000 bulk pickups. This is extra trash that people leave on the curb. This is an on-demand service, so this is not part of the dumping issue.",el paso
09_28_2021,homeless,"And so for item number 29, I just had a quick question related to...  the definition of a [INSTITUTION] it refers back it refers back to say as defined as a [INSTITUTION] and so I just want to understand for a purpose of you know for public engagement can you define what is considered a [INSTITUTION] good [TIME] representative [ORGANIZATION] assistant chief [PERSON] for the record  The definition used for the ordinance amendment [INSTITUTION] comes from the regulation from the [ORGANIZATION] and that definition is verbatim under the authority given to utilize that option. OK.",el paso
09_28_2021,homeless,"And do you happen to have that definition by the [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, the definition means a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter or other facility that is designed to provide temporary living accommodations to individuals who lacks a fixed regular and adequate residence. Okay, so with this proposal, what is the distance in terms of between a [INSTITUTION] and consuming alcohol?",el paso
09_28_2021,homeless,"From the [INSTITUTION] under that definition it's under 1,000 feet the buffer zone so it would be under just over three football fields to give you the visualization on it. And at our next meeting could we could we see a map that would show these buffer zones?  as it relates to the existing shelters we're coming back on [ORGANIZATION] with the full presentation on it for [ORGANIZATION] and we'll be able to answer any questions that you have okay",el paso
09_28_2021,homeless,yeah what i would like to see is the existing homeless shelters and then where this would be applicable um okay thank you for that um regarding i had a number of questions for [ORGANIZATION]  I've emailed them. I'm happy to repeat them if you'd like me to.,el paso
09_28_2021,homeless,I just am requesting a briefing from [ORGANIZATION] before this is brought back to better understand exactly what  um a non-comment agreement for professional services to perform energy management services is yes we'll provide those briefings as well wonderful thank you so much may we have a motion to delete so moved is there a second there's a motion made by representative [ORGANIZATION] seconded by representative PERSON1 to delete the item on that motion call for the vote representative PERSON2 thank you in the voting session and the motion passes unanimously  the next item is [ORGANIZATION] this is discussion in action on a resolution to approve a 12th amendment to the city's [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]th [DATE] action plan for the emergency solutions grant coronavirus phase 2 to reduce the homeless welcome shelter center funds to supplement the opportunity center shelter and homeless management information system support project motion to approve second  there's a motion made by representative PERSON3 seconded by representative PERSON4 to approve there is public comment on this item from mr PERSON5 mr PERSON6 are you in the queue sir star six,el paso
09_28_2021,homeless,oh hello mr [ORGANIZATION] thank you sir you all have three very few comments i just wanted to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to PERSON1 and the community and human development department they have been an excellent partner in working with the homeless within the community And I'm also here to answer any questions that you might have. Just so I didn't really have any prepared comments.,el paso
10_25_2022,homeless,"In [ORGANIZATION], we've also been able to serve 802 homeless individuals. 59% of our patients at [ORGANIZATION] are unfunded individuals. We do offer 24 program services to include primary care, pediatric, dental, pharmacy, behavioral health, outreach and enrollment.",el paso
10_25_2022,homeless,"As Ms. [PERSON] stated, 90% of the people they serve are homeless. Are in the category of poverty right now so reporting the this was the One out of five opacens was reported in the [ORGANIZATION] action plan Which is also was reported by [ORGANIZATION] for the city of [ORGANIZATION] on [LOCATION] next slide please here is the list of a  ZIP CODES IN THE AREA WERE NEARLY 52% OVER 65 OR DISABLED RESIDENTS HOMESTEAD EXEMPTIONS PROPERTIES ARE FILLED WITH THE EL PASO CENTRAL APPRAISAL DISTRICT ARE FILED WITH IT I'M SORRY OR FILED WITH CENTRAL APPRAISAL DISTRICT ITEM 23 OF CITY COUNCIL PRESENTATION SLIDE 5",el paso
10_25_2022,affordable housing,I'm sorry under the [INSTITUTION] section to oppose any legislation that would limit municipalities ability to regulate peer-to-peer car sharing companies and And then under animal services add a support item that would allow shelter animals to be spayed and neutered by veterinarians That maybe have a license from a different state. That's not from [ORGANIZATION] We're also looking to add an affordable housing section section.,el paso
10_25_2022,affordable housing,"For affordable housing? Yes, so the support legislation that prioritizes viable transactions for 4% low income housing, what is a viable transaction as defined by the 4% low income housing tax credit applications? So I believe we have [ORGANIZATION] on the line from [ORGANIZATION].",el paso
10_25_2022,affordable housing,"As far as the second example that you cited, what you're hearing that there might be an effort made by the legislature to try to,  limit the municipality's authority to pass park fees. And then I'll transfer to some snappers joining us. I do know that there has been a lot of talk prior to this session concerning affordable housing.",el paso
10_25_2022,affordable housing,"And from the building community, there's been a lot of talk from that community basically saying that there are a lot of  regulations that municipalities have that prevent them from being able to provide more affordable housing. So the park fees that municipalities may be charging, that might be one of the things that they have talked about, but in general, that is something that more likely will also come up during this legislative session. The legislature will be looking at whether or not there really are regulations, ordinances that municipalities have  that may impact the ability of builders to provide affordable housing, for example, in some of the fees that municipalities have.",el paso
10_25_2022,homeless,"we did it for homeless shelters we did it for schools etc right in places where we knew that he needed to provide additional assistance in order to prevent the spread of covid under that same authority the city council supported his direction to issue a county-wide mass mandate and then those are reviewed periodically however there aren't any  expiration date set by statute, it's simply the authority given to him under state code and the health code to issue those types of orders to protect the public health and safety. That's what the authority was that Dr. [PERSON] issued his countywide mandate. And then it doesn't come back to council in terms of approval.",el paso
10_25_2022,affordable housing,yes It's the first item under the affordable housing section. So we would be postponing the item relating to [LOCATION] legislation that prioritizes viable transactions for 4% low income tax credit applications,el paso
10_25_2022,affordable housing,"Okay, this is to postpone the section under affordable housing and  that supports legislation that prioritizes viable transactions for 4% low-income housing tax credit applications. For [ORGANIZATION], is that enough time? I think we would have to ask [ORGANIZATION].",el paso
10_25_2022,affordable housing,So this is postponed for how long?  [ORGANIZATION]. Postponed for [LOCATION]. The three items under affordable housing section to support legislation that prioritizes viable transactions for 4% low income housing tax credit applications that support legislation that would repeal the two mile DATE2 rule for low income housing tax credits or allow municipalities to approve a waiver of the rule and support legislation that would limit housing finance corporations to operate only within the municipal city limits.,el paso
10_25_2022,homeless,Our [DATE] of operations for that was as well on [ORGANIZATION]. and in our covet isolation and quarantine hotels as we've been doing throughout the covet pandemic those continue to go on and that's to make sure we don't have those large outbreaks in a congregated setting so whether it's in the ngo or homeless shelters we're making sure that we can isolate them again we've covered this slide the last couple of presentations but,el paso
07_05_2023,affordable housing,"you all are aware, any agreements that are in [STREET], as long as the  applicants continue to perform we would continue to rebate in the terms of those agreements so streetcar service does not affect any active agreements with that said you know [PERSON] was talking a little bit about how we use public policy to create an economic ecosystem that's really reflective and supportive of things like the streetcar of our other businesses so we wanted to also flag some opportunities for growth so the downtown and uptown plan which is a little bit later on [ORGANIZATION]'s agenda  Key recommendations from the economic development side include things like a public facility corporation. This allows us to fill gaps on some of those housing projects. It does also require an affordable housing component, so helping us reach that 10,000 unit goal, but also making sure that we've got the affordability in [STREET] to make sure that our housing stock is sustainable.  things like a low interest revolving loan program.",el paso
07_05_2023,affordable housing,"So that's the third key regulatory change. We're also looking at some key investment and financing structures. We identified in previous presentation some of the feasibility gaps that exist currently with bringing forward market rate projects and affordable projects, and that's where we really need to be taking a closer look at our Chapter 380 agreements, looking specifically at affordable housing as well as new construction, looking at adoption of an uptown TERS, again  We know that there's not only going to be issues with housing, but also how do we bring forward some of the recommendations related to infrastructure and the TERS is a really key component.",el paso
07_05_2023,affordable housing,"Also looking at [ORGANIZATION] to attract the mixed income housing developments and affordable housing. And then finally looking at creating a housing trust or bond. Again, because those funds, the funding needs to be there in order to bring some developers to the table and to see these housing units that the plan proposes come to the study area.",el paso
07_05_2023,affordable housing,"But in addition to that, we've added specific recommendations.  for anti-displacement measures.
